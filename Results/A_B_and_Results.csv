0,Letter from the Dean of the College.,21 December 1898,"EDITOR COLUMBIA SPECTATOR : DEAR SIR: —The past year has been one of marked prosperity in the affairs of the College. The number of students has been larger than ever before, and the general tone and spirit have been admirable. Such a thing as "" college discipline,"" in the old sense of the phrase, or any occasion for it, is practically unknown. Times have changed and we have changed with them. The temptations to disorder that once assailed a body of college students seem to have, here, substantially lost their compelling force. In their place are other allurements, to entice unwary, inattent_ ive and weak young men away from the straight and rugged path that leads to knowledge and character —We can't! we can't, no way in this world, escape trouble,"" said Captain Pliaro Kobbe of the Basin. But the temptations are of a different sort, and to another and less jejune side of a student's character. ' They are none the less and are possibly more dangerous., but they lead to different manifestations: they require another kind of watchfulness on the part of those subjected to them, and other treatment, principally of counsel and encouragement, on the part of the responsible officers. s „ The removal to Morningside .Heights, and. the experience of a year here, have had something to do with this—though the happy transformation was well under way before the departure from Forty-ninth Street. The influence of the curriculum which was put into full effect a year ago, and by which liberty of election, within wise limits, is allowed every student, has had something more to do with it: as have, also, the presence of a large body of university students earnestly pursuing,Undet favorable conditions,' advanced courses for the love of learning- or for the acquirement of a profession; the library and great departmental buildings, magnificent and imposing without, and within attractive and inspiring by reason of their thorough equipment and most liberal and effective administration; the ample and perfectly appointed gymnasium, to which mere verbal description can scarcely do justice, and which, to be fully appreciated, "" needs but to be seen."" Surely, the Columbia College student of to-day may well say: ""The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; yea, I have a goodly heritage."" In the Christmas salutations and general congratulations which I here offer to the college students, I regret, more than I ean well express, that I can not felicitate them upon the completion of commodious college dormitories and upon the near prospect of a proper College Hall. With these most desirable, not. to say necessary, accompaniments of the unrivalled educational opportunities offered by Columbia, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that the number of students: in the College would be mo;re than doubled within a very few years. H 'ynvo h For the erection of dormitories, the first steps have been taken. At their December meeting, the Trustees approved the general plan of four dormitories to be placed upon the Green, two. on. One Hundred and Twentieth Street and two adjoining them, one on Amsterdam vAvenue and the other on the Boulevard, and declared their purpose to build them as soon as means therefor shall be provided by gift or legacy."" One-deter-rent to expansion is thus put in .the way of removal. •. ... ' * Toward a College Hall that shall express the important place held by the old College in the general university scheme, nothing, at least nothing effective; has been done, hv As, in time ' long past, Cato, fearing for his beloved Rome the recuperative and aggrres-sive power of Carthage, was wont to end his every address, whatever the subject, Preeterea censeo, Carthaginem esse delendam; and as, in the days preceding our Civil War, Henry Ward Beecher, dreading the evil effect upon his country of human bondage at the South, introduced into every public speech that he made a denunciation of slavery ; so I, in a constructive rather than a destructive spirit, following them, non passibus cequis, and, from the intrinsic merit of the object, hoping for some measure of their success, must urge, in every communication that I am privileged to make to Columbia men, the crying need of a dignified and splendid College Hall. The present makeshift is a standing reproach. Already too long has it been allowed to cumber the ground, to wound the sensibilities of the Alumni and mortify the pride of the undergraduates, and to give a wrongful impression to the multitudes who visit the University. Will not some lover of his Alma Mater , some generous and highminded citizen —alive to the vital importance of. providing, and providing here, thorough fundamental training, , a broad and liberal education, for the youth of this great community—do away with this indignity ? Amid the stately buildings upon this site, in . the near neighborhood of the Cathedral, the Hospital, and the Monument, dedicated to our Holy Religion, to divine compassion, and to patriotism, at the crown of this cosmopolitan city that is the gateway of a continent, where could a memorial of a man and his beneficent public spirit be more conspicuously placed? And what memorial could bd more noble and enduring than a worthy home of the ""Liberal Arts and Sciences,"" a fit Temple of the Humanities ? a temple wherein "" The inward service of the .mind and soul Grows wide withal.'"" , Respectfully, V, V'. .J < . .... • ' J. H. VAN -AMRINGE. Columbia College, December 15, 1898. ; •"
1,Faculty Resolutions Listed,8 January 1937,"The complete text of the Resolutions passed upon by the Faculty follows: 1. That the course Contemporary Civilization A be reduced from five hours per week to four hours per week, with four points credit toward the degree for each session. 2. That the course English A be discontinued as a required course for the Bachelor of Arts degree. 3. That a two-year course to be known as Humanities A and B be organized as a required course for the Bachelor of Arts degree, meeting four hours per week and carrying four points credit during each session of the first year, and two hours per week with two points credit during each session of the second year; that the course be conducted with the cooperation of the Departments of Greek and Latin, English and Comparative Literature, Fine Arts, Music, Philosophy and the modern foreign languages; and that the course be under the administrative charge of the Committee on instruction which shall appoint an operating committee consisting of representatives of the abovementioned departments. With permission of the Committee on Instruction a student may substi-tute for Humanities B a year of advanced work of not less than three hours a week in one of the humanistic fields. 4. That in conjunction with the requirement in English C, each student in the freshman year be required to write one or more essays, aggregating 5000 words, in connection with such first-year courses as may be appropriate; that in the sophomore year each student be required to write a single 5000 word essay in connection with one of his courses; and that these requirements be administered by the Department of English with the advice and assistance of the instructors in whose courses the essays are written. 5. That the present course requirement for the degree in foreign languages be replaced by a requirement of proficiency in reading one of the following foreign languages—French, German, Greek or Latin, or another language with special permission of the Committee on Instruction; that the level of proficiency be set as follows: (1) in the case of a language presented for admission, at the point normally achieved by one year of College work following the' three yearsrequired for admission, or (2) in the case of a language not presented for admission, at the point normally achieved by two years of College work; that proficiency be determined by means of a test known as Langauge A; that the tests be administered by a committee organized under the Committee on Instruction and having a majority of its members from the foreign language departments; and that students now in residence be permitted, if they so choose, to satisfy the requirement in foreign languages by passing the above-described tests instead of fulfilling the old course requirements. 6. Resolutions One through Five shall become operative for students entering College in 1937."
2,"Edman Describes Values Of Humanities Sequence Develops Judgement Of Literary Works, Professor Says",20 September 1937,"Develops Judgement Of Literary Works, Professor SaysBy IRWIN EDMAN(Invin Edman is Professor of Philosophy at Columbia and is Chairman of the program committee of Humanities A.) Perhaps the best way of describing the new Humanities A course, which will be required of all freshmen begining this fall, is to point out certain things which it is not, and which it is not intended to be, and which, in so far as things can be arranged in advance, there is no possibility of its becoming. It is not, in the usual and objectionable sense of that term, or indeed in any sense of the term, a ""survey"" course. It is not, and is not intended to be, a ""Cook's Tour through the history of European literature and philosophy. It is not a series of tid-bits from the Great Books of the World, designed to insure ""General Culture."" The positive aim of the course is perhaps adequately described in the first sentence of the announcement in the Columbia College catalogue. The aim of this course is to develop in the student literary taste and judgment, as well as habits of philosophical analysis, through a careful acquaintance with a series, in more or less chronological order, of the outstanding masterpieces in the literature and philosophy of the European tradition. Range from Homer to Goethe The readings range in time from Homer to Goethe; they include in type, plays: two from each of the great Greek dramatists in the first term, four plays of Shakespeare and three of Moliere, in the second term; philosophy: the ""Republic"" of Plato, and the ""Meditations"" of Marcus Aurelius in the first term, and Hobbes and Spinoza in the second term; poetry: the ""Divine Comedy"" of Dante, ""Paradise Lost"" of Milton; the novel: Fielding's ""Tom Jones,"" Cervantes' ""Don Quixote;"" the essay: Montaigne. But the list of authors and of readings does not pretend to be exhaustive, or even completely representative. There is, however, nothing on the list that, in the judgment of the program Committee or the staff of twenty, representing half a dozen different departments, who are to give the course this year, that is not of first-rate calibre in its own kind. Will Meet 4 Hours a Week An examination of the detailed program will reveal several striking facts about the nature of the project: The course will meet four hours a week; plenty of time is allowed in the schedule for careful reading of the actual texts. There will be no use of hand-books, or text-books, or outlines. Class discussion will be centered on the texts themselves, which will serve at once to acquaint the students with a set of masterpieces in literature and philosophy, and thereby to sharpen and discipline their powers of literary criticism and philosophical understanding. The course will not be conducted as a lecture course but as a discussion group founded on the careful reading (insured by frequent examinations) of the texts themselves. Through a happy arrangement with the Bookstore, the set of books to be used in the course, in available cheap editions, will be made accessible to ' s' udents at a very nominal price, ormay be rented for the semester at an even more nominal price. A Cooperative Project One of the functions that this course is designed to serve is to start or to nourish interests that may be developed in succeeding years by special study in one of the languages or literatures involved, or in philosophy. The project is a cooperative one, staffed by the departments of English, French, German, Greek and Latin, Philosophy, and History. Those of us who have been working on the program for the course feel that along with the General Science course and Contemporary Civilization, the Humanities course will provide a balanced and vertebrate curriculum for the first two years of Columbia College, the second year of the Humanities being devoted to a cooperative course given by the departments of Fine Arts and Music, which will aim to do for those fields what Humanities A will undertake to do for literature and philosophy. In the case of the Humanities course it is felt and hoped that this new project will provide something of an equivalent for the values derived by an earlier generations students from the whole classical curriculum, and' develop standards of taste and judgment by a disciplined acquaintance with some, at least, of ""the best that has been known and thought in the world."" It should be pointed out that although Humanities A is required, Humanities B, which is given this autumn as an elective course, will in succeeding years be required only for those who does not elect some specific course in the field of the Humanities. It should also be added that the new Humanities does not add to the burden of requirements in the first year, since English A, until now three hours a week, is no longer required, and Contemporary Civilization has been reduced from five to four hours a week."
3,The Dean Reports,27 September 1937,"Dean Hawkes' report on Columbia College provides food for thought not so much for what it says as for what it has failed to say. The first, and by far the largest part of the report, describes changes which have been made in the Lower College, i.e. institution of Humanities A and B, alteration of the language requirement and incorporation of English C into the Humanities work. These innovations and modifications of the College curriculum have already been applauded and accepted. In discussing the recommendations for the Upper College, however, the Dean points out that there will probably be no revision of the present curriculum. He says:— The new recommendations will have to do with the ways and means of helping each individual student to determine where he had better throw the .plr : in his advanced work and how to do it . . . this wii! mean an extension of our advisory system, especially for the Upper College. x The first move has already been made with the appointment of four instructors to assist Professor Powell in his capacity as adviser to pre-medical students. When a pre-med enters his Junior year, he goes from assistant to main adviser and whatever knowledge the assistant may have gained from his two years of contact is lost in the process. This first step perverts the purpose of the extension of the advisory system—that the adviser be able to help the student choose his later work, and be. able to judge his fitness to pursue professional studies. The assistants thus far appointed, have no immediate academic interests in the field of medicine or science and, therefore, their advice must lack a sound basis. To insure a high quality of advisory work, Dre-professional Freshmen might be divided ncmg instructors, preferably alumni of the College, whose field is directly germaine to the students' work. These advisers should continue with the student through his college career, fulfilling all the functions now carried on by the advisers. The final approval of programs and the procedure of application to professional schools, however, may still rest with the main adviser. Acquaintance with courses and preprofessional problems as well as intimate contact with advisers is guaranteed by such a system. It is, in the final analysis, merely an amplification of the present advisory system, designed to cope with the growing size of pre-pro-fessional groups. While the Committee on Instruction is contemplating change in the College curriculum, it should also devote serious thought to the possibility of introducing some form of the tutorial system which is now operating with great effectiveness at Harvard. In large college classes such as Psychology 1, small groups could be assigned to graduate students in the department for individual consultation. The borderline student would thereby be materially aided and the better student guided toward advanced work. A tutorial system and an extended advisory system, if put into effect, would guarantee individual attention throughout the four years of undergraduate work. In this way the chances of a student's becoming a misfit in Columbia College would be reduced to the vanishing point."
4,Dean Hawkes Explains Humanities Course,29 September 1937,"This continues Dean Herbert E. Hatches' report on the year 1936-37 to President Nicholas Murray Butler. Our difficulty arises from the fact that some of those who are admitted to college are suffering from a delayed adolescence so serious that although they are of college age or perhaps beyond it in some respects, they are far below it in others. This difficulty can only be overcome by a desire on the part of the College to understand each individual and an attitude of cooperation on the part of the student in the enterprise of his education. As a corollary to the admission of the ""whole man"" there follows the necessity for becoming acquainted with him so far as possible, and attempting to provide the kind of education that is best adapted ro his needs. This rules out any set of hard and fast rules, applied to all without regard to individual cases. It does not mean that everyone follows the whims of the moment without let or hindrance; it does mean that so far as possible we replace rules by intelligence, although .'t would be much easier to use ""the rule of the Faculty"" as a substitute for thoughtful attention to each individual situation. The obvious danger in trying to conduct a college by intelligence rather than rules is that there may not be enough intelligence to go around. But even at that, I believe that this principle should be applied so far as possible. Justice Holmes expressed the same point of view when he said that ""To rest upon a formula is a slumber that, prolonged, means death."" Provide for Individual Needs The gradual adoption of achievement tests, the waiving of requirements which seem unprofitable to the individual, the flexible treatment of the work in English composition, the elimination of a rigid major requirement expressed in terms of credit points, the development of the advisory system, all point in the direction of provision for the individual needs of the individual student. One further guiding principle must be mentioned. The first two years of college, which may be called the Lower College, are useful for manystudents in finding their intellectual interest, or in verifying the accuracy of an earlier choice. For this reason wide rather than narrow fields of study are presented in the first two years, in preparation for the more intense specialization of the Upper College. Ever since the course in Contemporary Civilization was organized in 1918 this idea has been gaining ground steadily, until Faculty action last December carried it to its logical conclusion so far as the Lower College is concerned. Further Suggestions Expected The Committee on the Revision of the Curriculum, earlier referred • to, has presented only that portion of its report having to do with the Lower College. The recommendations regarding the Upper College are expected early in the coming Winter Session. The recommendations unanimously adopted by the Faculty in Decembercomprise three important features. The most striking one is the organization of a course in the humanities normally prescribed for freshmen and sophomores, together with the changes necessary for its proper offering. That is, the prescribed freshman course in English is withdrawn, and the course in Contemporary Civilization is reduced from five hours weekly to four. The work in English composition is reorganized and is related to the freshman's whole program for the subject matter of themes. The department of English will continue to read all themes for form and literary values. Explains Lack of Tests The requirement in the languages, either ancient or modern, is expressed in terms of a test of proficiency in reading the language instead of the previous course prescriptiori. The principal reason that this step has not been taken at an earlier time is the difficulty of preparing an examination in reading ability at the desired level which shall be reliable and comparable over a term of years. With the development of more dependable techniques in the art of examination, the time seemed to be ripe for this action. The first year of the humanities course will be offered during the year 1937-38. The second part, Humanities B, dealing chiefly with the fine arts and music, will also be offered as an elective, but not as a prescribed course until a year later. The first part of the course is devoted to literature, and will be presented in small sections by a staff of teachers remarkable not alone for their competency to offer a course as difficult to present as this course is bound to be, but for the enthusiasm and devotion with which they have attacked all of the complexities inherent in the • situation. Course No Cook's Tour The Chairman of the Subcommittee has said: Perhaps the best way of describing the new Humanities A course which will be required of all freshmen beginning next fall, is to point out certain things which it is not, and which it is not intended to be, and which, in so far as things can be arranged in advance, there is no possibility of its becoming. It is not, in the usual and objectionable sense of the term, a ""survey"" course. It is not, and is not intended to be, a Cook's tour through the history of European literature and philosophy. It is not a series of tidbits from the Great Books of the World designed to insure general culture. The positive aim of the course is perhaps adequately described in the first sentence of the announcement in the Columbia College catalogue. ""The aim of this course is to develop in the student literary taste and judgment, as well as habits of philosophical analysis, through a careful acquaintance with a series, in more or less chronoligacl order, of the outstanding masterpieces in the literature and philosophy of the European tradition.""The list of authors to be read includes Homer, the Greek dramatists, Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Hobbers, Spinoza, Dante, Moliere, Shakespeare, Milton, Fielding, Cervantes, Montaigne, and Goethe. The list does not pretend to be exhaustive, but is representative of the greatest. There will be no handbooks, outlines, or texts about these authors or books; instead there will be a careful reading of these masterpieces, followed by class discussion aimed at a sharpening of the powers of literary criticism and philosophical understanding. There are many serious problems incident upon the adoption of this course, which is prescribed in addition to the course in Contemporary Civilization and the necessary work in science and the languages. The first year of college will be filled up with courses demanding a tremendous amount of reading. Whether the burden will be too much for slow readers is a question that must be carefully observed. In any case this program necessitates more careful diagnostic and remedial work for those who have not learned to read rapidly. It will also require constant vigilance to discover those boys for whom this program is ill adapted. It is hoped that there will be few such cases, but we cannot be certain until the course is actually under way. Few Upper College Changes Although it is too early to be certain as the exact recommendations concerning the Upper College, a preliminary report which was discussed at a Faculty smoker in April indicates their tendencies. Unless all signs fail, the substance of the changes in the Upper College will not involve any drastic modification of the requirements for the degree. All of these prescribed courses would normally be completed while the student is still in the Lower College. The new recommendations will have to do with the ways and means of helping each individual student to determine where he had better throw the emphasis in his advanced work and how to do it. It is so be hoped that the abilities, interests, and ambitions of each student will be so clearly analyzed with the help of appropriate members of the staff that with a minimum of rules each student will be able to decide what he should do. This will mean an extension of our advisory system, especially for the Upper College. It will not mean that someone will make the sudent's decisions for him, in accordance with some rule laid down by the adviser, but that with friendly assistance the student will be enabled to make his own decisions with more knowledge of facts and conditions than he otherwise could have done. The ambition of the adviser should be to perform the service of the wise man of long ago of whom it was said, ""His words make men to stand upon their feet."" Just how this extension of the advisory system will be worked out remains to be seen, but the fact that the various departmental officers recognize the importance of this attitude is excellent promise of its success.(To Be Continued)"

Will Consider Five Topicjs On the aggenda for discussion are five points: first, student opinion of the texts used; second, the value of syllabus summaries and lesson analyses as an aid to study; third, arrangement of the course material; fourth, the relationship of the course to Humanities A. and, fifth, suggestions of the students pertaining to the course. These meetings were inaugurated at the same time that the C. C. course was introduced to the curriculum as a required subject lor ail freshmen.

7,Spectator Sports On The SIDELINES Tennis Topics,29 March 1939,"On The SIDELINESTennis TopicsBy STANLEY L. TEMKOEarly in the fall Campus tennis enthusiasts, crowded around the South Field courts for the University Open tourney, had visions of an all-con-quering Columbia team riding roughshod over its opponents in the then distant Spring. With Chauncey Steele and lanky Leo Hayes playing much improved tennis, there seemed little doubt that the Blue and White net men would line-up as the most formidable Lion aggregation in recent years. Certainly Steele, boasting one of the finest games on Eastern courts, was destined to take his place in the ranks of a great string of Columbia captains, men of the calibre of Leon Hartman and Davey Jones who went onto make their marks in national competition after distinguished Mornmgside careers. Hayes, while not approaching the captain-elect in experience or repertoire of shots, came through with a fine performance in the number three slot last season, and was counted onto step up a notch this Radical Change Spring. But a few months time has seen a radical change in the tennis picture. One great blow to Columbia hopes came when Steele withdrew from school after the Winter session. Then Hayes decided to limit his court efforts to informal play and thus retain his eligibility for a probable switch to Annapolis next September. To top the rapid disintegration of the Lion forces, Lou Persinger, an outstanding net-player and stellar doubles-man, will probably be ineligible because of scholastic difficulties. The only reassuring note in the whole picture was the recent appointment of Don Frame, former Harvai-d captain as faculty adviser to the now depleted squad. The well-built Cantab great, who captured the 1932 Eastern Intercollegiate singles event, knows tennis thoroughly and is proving an invaluable aid. But Frame's appointment as advisor is only a short step in the right direction. Though thoroughly qualified to serve as coach of any college tennis squad, the erstwhile Crimson star is primarily a French instructor. A full schedule of language courses and the added burden of trying to pound a bit of Humanities A 2 into the willing but not always able heads of Frosh leaves Frame little time to aid the Varsity net men. Still Need Coach There is still a crying need of a paid tennis coach at Columbia. The appointment of a faculty advisor, no matter how capable, can only slightly ameliorate the situation. Frame himself is among the first to emphasis the basic inadequacy of the present set-up. Despite his enthusiasm and ability both as a player and coach, the French instructor just can't do justice to the squad. Tennis is a sport in which success is based to a large degree on painstaking instruction—a standout tennis team must have a full time coach, not simply an amateur who has been kind enough to offer his services. Necessity for a mentor has been made all the more apparent by the loss of Steele, Hayes, and Persinger. All three have had private instruction, and while they were by no means infallible in choice of shots and in other fine points in the 1938 campaign, the trio undoubtedly were far more polished than the rest of the squad. At the present time the outlook is utterly discouraging. Although several of the candidates have the physical equipment to make them thoroughly competent performers ,the lack of adequate coaching and the insufficient indoor practice facilities make the rapidly approaching suicide schedule loom as an unsurmountable obstacle.."
8,"No, Mr. Kinne, on Auto-da-Fe Isn't The Grand-Daddy of a Rolls Royce",11 May 1939,"By J. ROBERT CHERNEFF and HERBERT H. PRASHKERWhile 450 perspiring Freshmen racked their brain over the Voltaire Humanities quiz yesterday, little Burdette I. Kinne just laughed and laughed 'cause he knew that an auto-da-fe wasn't the granddaddy of a Rolls-Royce. In fact it is being bruited about that Mr. Kinne, no doubt feeling his oats with the onrushing Spring, was equally certain that Voltaire had an aversion for Homer and the classics because he just didn't like 'em, that's all. Surely, Mr. Kinne, it have been because: (a) He didn't take Humanities A 1-2, or (b) He did take Humanities A 1-2. Or that this is the best of all possible worlds since a certain social dieae limits population by preventing people from going to town. Maybe the erudit Voltaire had a violent distaste for Homer and Co. because; (a) He once went to Columbia College and had to take a quiz on Homer that hardly made English, when he hadn't more than half read it. or (2) He had a choice of eithergoing to a Barnard coffee dance or reading Homer and Barnard won after a very tough struggle. Anyway, the above mentioned Freshmen had quite a laugh over the said quiz, especially after resisting the temptation to aver that Mile. Cunegonde' visible means of support were not very beautiful. However, as the Old Woman might say, after taking the notorious quiz, ""I probably flunked, buttocks doesn't make any difference."""

11,UNIVERSITY 4- 1867 Columbia Students Led Dickensian Lives,18 March 1941,"1867 Columbia Students Led Dickensian LivesHumanities A would have been a cinch to the Columbia Freshman, class of '67. The entrance requirements of his day sound like a Humanities reading list. The complete academic requirements was that ""No student will be admitted into the Freshman class unless he be accurately acquainted with the grammar of both the Greek and Latin tongues, including such rules of prosody as may be applicable to such of the Poets as he is to be examined upon; be master of Caesar's Commentaries; of the Orations of Cicero against Catiline and for the poet Archias; of the first six books of Virgil's Aeneid; of Sallust; of the Gospel according to St. Luke and St. John, and the Acts of the Apostles; of Jacob's Greek Reader; of the first three books of Xenophon's Anabasis and the first three books of Homer's Iliad. ""He must also be able to translate English into grammatical Latin, and must be well versed in the first four rules of arithmetic; the rule of three direct and inverse; vulgar and decimal fractions, the extraction of the square and cube roots; and Algebra as far as the end of the simple equations."" If you know all that, why go to college? Life wasn't so simple after you'd been admitted, either. Rule 9 declares that ""No student shall bring into the Chapel or any of the lecture rooms any cane, umbrella, or newspaper, nor any book other than those used in his course of study."" Rule 10 was tougher. ""No missile of any description shall be thrown by any student within the College nor upon the grounds, except in such games of recreation as the President may permit before and after the hours of attendance."" Undoubtedly the wearing of top-hats at that time had something to do with the proclamation. The professors gave a maximum mark of ten for each student's performance, down to zero for inability or refusal to recite. At the end of the month the marks were averaged, with demerits taken into account. A misconduct entitled the professor to award a demerit of not more than ten, and an unexcused absence was worth the same penalty. Absences could only be granted by the president. Grades weren't given, but the class lists were posted, with students' names listed in order of proficiency. ""Any student who feels aggrieved can challenge the student who supplanted him"" to a competition before the entire faculty on any work done that term. The library was only open from one to three P.M. to Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores, ""and such of the Freshman Class as may be designated by the president."" A. J. R."
12,"Barnard Dedicates Tomorrow's Greek Games to Beauty, Love",4 April 1941,"Barnard's thirty-ninth annual Greek Games, dedicated this year to Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty, will take place tomorrow at 3 P.M. in the college gymnasium. Most vigorous of all intramural activity across the tracks, the Games will climax months of intensive preparation in song, poetry, dance, costume design and athletics.Rivalry between the Sophomore and Freshman classes is unusually keen this year, with the fighting Frosh already having a slight edge in pre-game competition. In sharp contrast to last year' 3 fracas, dedicated to the fire-god Prometheus and telling the story of that wench Pandora, tomorrow's deals with the ruse by which Hippomenes won Atalanta to wife. As Humanities A experts may remember, Atalanta had been suckled during her immaturity by a maternal she-bear. This resulted in her becoming the most fleetfooted of all mortals, and her decision to marry only the guy that could beat her in a foot race. This is where Aphrodite and Hippomenes came in. The former gave the latter three golden apples, and Hippomenes dropped them one after another during the race. Atalanta, frail femme, stopped to pick them up, and then a Hollywood ending takes place. Judges will be: athletics—Mrs. Douglas McCormick, Mrs. Corliss Lamont and Miss WilhelmineMeissner; music—Miss Hinde Barnett, Walter Damrosch, Willard Rhodes; dance —Miss Florence Dubroff, Mrs. Julian Bryan and Mrs. Joseph Urban; lyrics Joseph Wood Krutch, Peter Munro Jack and Professor Ethel M. Thornbury. Mary Jo Jordan is Sophomore chairman, and Charlotte McKenzie leads the yearlings."

FrameFrench Instructor Doubles as Tennis, Squash Rackets ChampBy OSCAR HARKAVYThe University Open Tennis Tournament trophy in the display case in John Jay lobby has two names on it. Both of them read: ""Frame, D. M."" In addition to his court activity, Dr. Donald M. Frame, instructor in the French Department since 1938, gives several French c'ourses, teaches a Humanities A section and plays one of the best games of squash rackets in the Metropolitan area .Although he has always had a Morningside Heights address, Dr. Frame went to Loomis, a Connecticut prep school, and then to Harvard, graduating in 1932. He won a Cutting Travelling Fellowship in 1936-37, which he spent in Paris, and got his Ph. D. last June. Tours Europe With three other Harvard men, Dr. Frame bought one of those midget French autos, the Citroen, and travelled over Europe. ""Although we didn't learn much about Europe, we learned plenty about the Citroen,"" he asserted. It seems that they had four fires in the car during their voyage. Once, in the German city Nuss, the car bhrst into flames in the middle of heavy traffic. They hunted frantically about for some dirt with which to put out the fire, but the ""street-cleaning department was too efficient."" Finally, one fellow spied a pile around a corner and stuffed it into the car. The Germans thought it was a huge joke, but Dr. Frame ""wanted to erect a statue to the horses of the city."" College Champion ""Tennis was really my first sport,"" he related. He became proficient enough in it to captain the team in his senior year at Harvard and to win the Eastern Intercollegiates that same year. During his stay in France, he entered the French Nationals, was beaten in the first round and then went onto reach the finals in the Consolation tournament. Dr. Frame has played some of the -leading names in the tennis world, including Vines, Allison and Parker. Built more like a left tackle than a tennis player, people who have been swept off the courts by him claim that ""he hits the ball so darn hard, you just can't do anything with it."""
14,Dean Reports on Humanities Praises Survey Courses for New Methods,28 November 1941,"Praises Survey Courses for New MethodsHumanities A has justified the hopes of its originators by showing that college students gain more from reading great books in their context than from studying digests or criticisms of them, declares Dean Herbert E. Hawkes in a report released yesterday surveying the five-year history ofthe course 'The course in humanities has opened our eyes to the fact that college Freshmen do not need to be fed predigested food, the Dean says.""It is inevitable that some of them get more than others out of Plato or Lucretius or Spinoza, but most get the taste for reading the great book itself rather than what some critic says about it."" Throughout the required survey courses in the College, Dean Hawkes notes, the general theory of teaching generally by instructing in detail has been instituted. Accordingly, the Contemporary Civilization course is now taught by means of original readings of the. works that made history, as well as accompanying explanatory data. ""Our whole effort is to eliminate predigested opinions,' \the Dean concludes. ""The conclusions reached are of less importance than the training -received (through direct examination and discussion. But the method will remain and may be transferred from college courses to other monuments with which the students will come in contact throughout the rest of his life."""
15,"Fifty Frosh Enter Next Month Special C.C., Humanities Sections Discussed Today",9 January 1942,"Special C.C., Humanities Sections Discussed TodayColumbia's special class of Freshmen entering in Februarywill be limited to fifty or sixty ""rather superior"" students, Assistant Director of University Admissions Bernard P. Ireland announced yesterday. This will be possible because over 300 high school Seniorshave applied for admission at the beginning of the Spring Session, enabling the Admissions Office to select the top-ranking pupils. Meanwhile the College faculty was formulating the plans necessary to provide the courses and faculty that will be required for the new class. The Committee on Instruction is to meet late this afternoon to discuss the accelerated program, especially in regard to extra sections of Contemporary Civilization and Humanities A. The problem of whether to present sections of Humanities and C. C. A-l in February, or to have the new Freshmen take the second halves of these courses as soon as they enter and the first portion in September will be the main issue. Immediately after the Committee on instruction decides as to future policy, a commission of the members of the Humanities Department will assemble to draw up a definite program embodying the principles previously approved."
16,Elevator Calendar Prescribes Philosophers' Weekly Way of Life,6 February 1942,"Tattered and insignificant-look-ing, a little calendar dangling from the wall of the elevator in the Department of Philosophy is the key to the ideals and eccentricities of Columbia's sages. Labelled ""Sunlit Road Calendar"", the almanac is really a collection of classic quotations which serves to guide the philosophers down the road of life. Thought of the week, according to the bizarre Bible, is ""The soul occupied with great ideas best performs small duties"". This will be cogitated upon and treasured by Philosophy Department members until tomorrow, when a mysterious hand will turn a page and unveil next week's gem. Done in Old English script, the black and crimson messages draw heavily upon the wisdom of the men made famous by HumanitiesA. Goethe, Aristotle, Shakespeare, these and many other great minds are constant sources of inspiration. Interesting vistas are opened by this calendar for the many students enrolled in philosophy and accompanying courses. For example, a professor's state of mind can be accurately predicted merely by knowing the proper thought of the week. On February 15-21, and mark this date well, the calendar message will be ""If it be my lot to crawl, I will crawl contentedly"". Brief flurries of activity lie ahead in those weeks when the calendar will admonish sternly ""Up and be doing"", or ""Love Thy Work"", but these will be counterbalanced by soothing weeks of ""Rest is not idleness"". No, there are no quotations from Rabelais or James Joyce."
17,"Three Men, Book Star on 'Invitation to Learning'",5 March 1942,"Three men, a book, and an unrehearsed, impromptu literary discussion that comprises a fair thumJb-nail sketch of ""Invitation to Learning"", a radio program conducted by Professor Mark Van Doren of Columbia University, and broadcast over a coast-to-coast C.B.S. network every Sunday morning. ""Invitation to Learning"" might also be described as the radio listener's Humanities A course, for Professor Van Doren and his famous guest speakers confine their choice of works to the literary classics of all time. Begun two years ago by C.8.5., acting on the suggestions of Clifton Fadiman of ""Information Please"" fame and President Hutchins of the University of Chicago, the program was something new under the network sun, since it made no attempt to talk downto its country-wide audience. Much to the surprise of the three literary savants, such intellectual fare as St. Augustine's ""Confessions"", Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"", and Aristotle's ""Poetics"" proved entirely to the taste of a large part of the public, and ""Invitation to Learning"" jumped almost immediately to a Crosley rating of two million.Professor Van Doren ascribed the program's success to its informality and naturalness. ""The audience ""overhears us talking among ourselves, and they like it"", the noted author remarked. Comment after each broadcasts is extensive, with listeners all over the country writing into agree, disagree, or discuss the particular classic. Most of these letters get sidetracked by WABC's secretarial staff, but a good number are forwarded to Professor Van Doren for a personal answer. The impact of the war on ""Invitation to Learning"" has been slight, Professor Van Doren indicated, but it has resulted in a number of discussions on classic historians like Tacitus, Thucydides, and Herodotus."
18,CURC Begins 18-Hour Day Transmission,9 March 1942,"CURC will inaugurate a permanent schedule of programs 18 hours a day starting today. This expansion of the station's broadcasting time comes after a preliminary extension to 16 hours two weeks ago. A midnight program of two hours was added last week. Two Frequency Modulation stations, W7INY and W2XMN, will broadcast congratulatory messages, hailing CURC's step as a milestone in the development of collegiate radio. These two FM stations will contribute a large part of CURC's future programs, as their regular schedule will be rebroadcast by the campus station between 8:45 A.M. and 8:00 P.M. Marking an advance in the use of radio in education, Professor Mark Van Doren's Humanities A 2 class attended CURC's U.S. Treasury program Friday featuring a transcription of the murderscene in ""Macbeth"", with Judith Anderson and Maurice Evans. Featured in today's broadcasts will be a rendition of a dramatic version of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" which will be aired tonight at 9:15."

Many of the undergraduate courses, offered for the first time this year to meet the need for accelerated programs, will cover a nine-week period, starting on the customary July 7 but continuing through September 4. College officials, in releasing details of the program to The Spectator, emphasized that the undergraduate course of study has been expanded and extended ""in such a way that students may substantially accelerate their courses without losing any of the important educational values."" Many Prescribed Courses The prescribed courses which have been added to enable entering students and present Freshmen to continue their studies over the summer include: Contemporary Civilization, Al, A 2 and Bl; Humanities A 2; Hygiene Al; English CI and C 2; and Physical Education A and B. Eighteen departments will offer courses which are expected to fulfill the needs of most undergraduate students as regards prerequisites and maturity credits. Most of the courses used to fulfill the 2-year math-science requirement and those given in preparation for the language proficiency tests will also be available. Upperclassmen, particularly those who can meet the prerequisites for graduate courses, will generally find the regular six-week offering adequate. Courses in math, naval science,and navigation will be offered specifically for students enrolled under the Navy's V-7 training program. A maximum of 12 points will be permitted each student in the nine-week session. College men who definitely expect to attend the Summer Session should have their programs approved by their advisors in April when next Fall's programs are also registered. Registration for the summer period will take place on July 2, 3 and 6. The regular fee of $12.50 a point will be charged. The expanded summer program will enable students to materially reduce the amount of time normally spent in College. Men entering in September, 1942, may graduate in June, 1945, if two summer sessions are included. Those who entered this past February can normally graduate in February, 1945, or even as early as September, 1944, if a sufficiently heavy program is undertaken."
20,CTA's 'Iphigenia' Best Yet Realistic Tragedy Recalls Old Greek Drama,25 March 1942,"Realistic Tragedy Recalls Old Greek DramaBy ROBERT M. BLEIBERGLines spoken by players twenty-three centuries ago came ringing to life in Brander Matthews Hall Monday evening, when the Columbia Theater Associates gave their memorable fifth presentation of the season, Euripides'""Iphigenia In Tauris"". Gertrude Keller, in the title role, was enough to make the Humanities A staff rock with glee, so impressively did she portray the itragic ""Iphigenia"" and so effectively did she give voice to the words of the Greek master. In undertaking the part of a superman woman, one capable of enduring the most noble and poignant emotions, Miss Keller had her work cut out for her, and the number of curtain calls at the end of the play amply attested to her success. But she was not alone in the tragedy. The character Orestes, brother of Iphigenia and son of Agamemnon, was given excellent interpretation by Kenneth Buckridge, who made a fine classic hero. Both leading players seemed to understand the stature of the people they were representing and their characterizations abounded in sonorous speeches and stately motions. The plot of ""Iphigenia in Tauris"" follows the Greek traditionof involving kingly rather than common personages. Iphigenia, daughter of King Agamemnon, was supposed to have been sacrificed by him at the outbreak of the Trojan War, but was saved by a goddess and made high priestess of Tauris, a savage country. Two Greek servants are brought to Tauris to be sacrificed, but are saved by Iphigenia. One of them discovers her identity and then reveals himself to her as Orestes, her brother. The dramatic climax occurs when divine interference saves the Hellenes. Adequate portrayals of Pylades, Thoas, sovereign of Tauris, a herdsman, a soldier, and Pallas Athene were given by Bliss Woodward, Mark Voland, Paul Barnett, Matt Jacobs, and Helen Fillya, while the performance owed much to the chorus of captive Greek women, Claude Lapham's music, and Richard Bernstein's simple Greek setting. ""Iphigenia"" will be presented during the rest of this week. Tickets are available at Brander Matthews at $.50 per subscription. BUY U. S. DEFENSE BONDS"

The regular College Catalogue, listing the courses for1942-43, will be ready for dis-G tribution at the Secretary's Office today, according to Dean Herbert E. Hawkes. All undergraduates expecting to continue their studies next fall must submit preliminary programs based on the courses in the new Catalogue by May 1. Aim of the new summer schedule, according to Professor Harry Morgan Ayres, director of the Session, is to ""explore such unused margins of time as there may be and to improve them may be and to improve them if Ayres continues, ""it seems the part of wisdom to preserve a structure that has developed through more than .forty years . . . and to add certain enlarged opportunities wherever there is prospect of serving the needs of students in a world at war."" In addition to the regular sixweek Summer session from July 7 to August 14, a series of extended College courses, which will also be open to women and to students at other institutions, willbe offered from July 7 to September 14. Equivalents of most of the required courses, such as CC'AI, A 2, and 81, English C-l and C-2, Humanities A 2, Physical Education, and Hygiene, are included in the nine-week program. Extensive porgrams in the sciences and languages are scheduled. Two new courses, Geology A 7 and Astronomy 6C, Navigation will be given for the first time. The Geology class dealing with the use and preparaton of military maps and conducted by Professor Armin K. Lobeck, is a special threepoint, three-week course offered in the intercession period from June 8 to 26. The Chemistry Department is offering four courses in the extended session. Two of these, Chemistry s3C and s4C, merely spread over nine weeks work that may be accomplished in six by more extensive study. Trigonometry, solid geometry, lanalytic geometry, and both halves of calculus are among the nine-week courses scheduled in Mathematics. In addition, a fourpoint class combining the first and second part of Calculus has been added to the list of courses offered in the regular session. In the language field, full-year courses equivalent to French Bl82, iand 82,3 will be offered in the lengthened term."
22,As We Don't See Them ... Dr. Wilbur M. Frohock,17 April 1942,"If you're strolling along Morningside Drive of these pleasant Spring afternoons and happen to see an angular giant wheeling a baby carriage and looking for all the world like a perfect model for the ""tough, but oh, so gentle"" ads, you'll be gazing at Dr. Wilbur M. Frohock of the French department. Besides changing the diapers of his newly-born offspring, Dr. Frohock is nowadays fretting away his spare time with feathers and twine making files, for he is an ardent fisherman and spends his summers in piscatorial pursuits while living in a shack near Londonderry, Vermont. Dr. Frohock is a swamp yankee from the well-known ""rock-bound coast."" He received his three degrees from Brown University where he played on""the worstfrosh basketball team in the history of the institution."" Although his main interest is French, Or. Frohock also teaches Humanities A. Famous in that course for his uncanny facility of recalling poetic quotations, he traces his ability in this line to his mother's policy of bullying him into the habit. ""The worse the poetry,"" he says,""the better I remember it."" Dr. Frohock worked his way ,up through the ranks of the N. Y. State Guard and is now a corporal. He thinks that the greatest modern novelist and ball team are respectively James Joyce and the Boston Red Sox. Beside all this, the person of Dr. Frohock, since he bets on Brown, presents during football seasons the only foolproof walking jackpot in Columbia University. D.K."
23,The Off-Hour . . . Free Enterprise,30 September 1942,". . . Free EnterpriseYou hay have read somewhere in Humanities A of the classic rivalry between the Greeks and the Trojans, the Montagues and the Capulets, the Martins and the Coys, Macy's and Gimbel's. Forget them; they have been rendered obsolete by a new feud. The reference, of course, is to the death struggle between the Remingtons and the Underwoods, a blody vendetta that raised itsi ugly head in the offices cf Spectator last week. We were standing around minding our own business, in the manner of the innocent bystander from time immemorial, when the door was flung open and in stalked a big man, followed closely by a smaller man. Obviously not freshmen, we deduced from their cigars, and went back to minding our own business. ""Hey kid,"" said the larger one breaking in on our meditations on the Hegelian dialectic, ""Hey kid, where are the typewriters? We're from the Remington company. We've come to fix 'em."" All this despite the fact that six typewriters, in various states of ruin, lay decaying on the desk before before his very eyes. Nursing our wounded pride, we crisply pointed out the machines and went back to Hegel, hoping perhaps that this would settle the matter. Not so. We had reckoned without the clannishness of the Remingtons and their implacable hatred of the Underwoods. ""Just a minute son, some of these typewriters are Underwoods. We never fix Underwoods. We wouldn't dare to. What if someone in the office should hear about it? Besides, (in the manner of a person reciting a well-learned lesson), we don't like Underwoods. Underwoods are bad."" Taken aback by the ferocity of the big man's voice as he Mssed the name ""Underwood,"" we looked at the small man for confirmation. He nodded vigorously, chorusing. ""We don't like Underwoods. Underwoods are bad."" They sounded so convincing we went into the inner office and looked at the Underwood, halfsuspecting that a viper might be hidden among' the shiny keys. It looked just the same as usual, just the same as the Remingtons. But try and convince the big man and the smaller man of that. They were here to repair Remingtons, and they were d d""if they'd go near the Underwoods. Two days ago our two Underwoods go out of commission, and we called up the Underwood company to send a repair man. In the spirit of scientific inquiry we got on the phone. ""By the way, we asked, could you repair several Remingtons we happen to have?"" The voice on the other end of the wire gasped and answered brusquely: ""We never fix Remington. We wouldn't dare. Remingtons are bad."" We hung up quietly."
24,The Off-Hour Greek Confusion,8 October 1942,"Greek ConfusionIn Humanities A we ran across what seemed to us a very confusing situation. Oedipus, son of Laius and Jocasta. killed the former and married the latter, thus becoming his own stepfather. Now, in Colloquium, we move on to the progency of Oedipus and Jocasta, besides which the problem of Humanities fades into insignificance. For these children of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polynices, are brothers, cousins, uncle and nephew, and when you throw in the girls, Antigone and Ismene, the combinations and permutations of the four defy description. In the ""Seven Against Thebes"" the issue comes to a head. Polynices has lost his half of the kingdom of Thebes four times. His cousin, his brother, his uncle and his nephew have combined to usurp his throne and cast him into exile. He gets mad, and when he gets mad he gets four times as mad as you and I, or maybe eight times or sixteen times as mad, for each of the four people he is hates each of the four people his brother is. , Under the influence of this towering rage Polynices blows each of his tops and assembles an army to regain his four heritages. It was somewhere in here that we got lost. Apparently Eteocles and Polynices met in lone combat, if you can call it that, and killed each other. A lot of relatives were also seriously affected.

25,"The Off Hour . . . Homer, Rabelais, Beowulf Teach Art of Mass Slaughter in Humanities, English 61",30 October 1942,"Homer, Rabelais, Beowulf Teach Art of Mass Slaughter in Humanities, English 61Recent congressional invectives against philosophy ""and such bunk"" have occasioned considerable worry among instructors of Humanities A and English 61. As far as we can see, the gentlemen seem assured of their livelihood, at least for the duration, because both courses to our mind are glorified histories of the art of killing. And that is quite essential today. The first dose of historic do-ing-away with other people is given to Frosh in their first volume of Homer. Throughout the book people are falling with a crash and""the armor clangs upon them"" and ""darkness covers their eyes."" Spears smite breasts between the nipples, arms and necks are cut off and ""tossed like a ball of stone"", knees are unstrung. It is very invigorating. Herodotus is more delicate. Heonly mentions the general carnage of it all but refrains from describing individual cases, unless they affect higher personages. Thucydides is likewise more inclined to take an over-all view of the blood bath. Singing of arms, Vergil again brings us to slaughter of Homeric proportions. Bullets pierce between the temples and spears sink into groins. Rabelais attains new heights of refinement. By natural means Pantagruel drowns his enemies and mows others down by using their captain as a scythe. Don Quixote will prove valuable in discernment of camouflage. The masquerading of armies into herds of sheep and knights into windmills present the first historic examples of man-made camouflage. G. H. O."

Response to this informal pool will therefore be influential in determining the final list of courses to be available this summer. Suggestions should be presented to the AVC office in the Southwest wing of the Veterans Affairs Building before the end of the week. The courses already planned to be given during the summer session, 1947 are: 3 WEEK COURSES —Intensive language— June 16-July 5, Aug. 18-Sept. 9 2nd, 3rd, 4th term of French, German, Spatiish (These intensive language courses must be taken alone) 9 WEEK COURSES—June 16-Aug. 15 CC 81, CC B2 Economics 7 and 8 English C 2 and C 4 Government 5 and 6 History 33 Hygiene A1 Humanities Bland 2 Philosophy 21 12 WEEK COURSES—June 16-September 5 CC A 2 Humanities A 2 ..

Bill, veterans attending summer classes must average a 'minimum of onfe point a week."
30,Summer Course Proposals Close; Deadline Friday,19 March 1947,"With demand for extensive summer courses expected to be at least as great as last year, the Columbia Chapter of the AVC is now conducting an informal poll of students in the College to find out what courses are wanted in addition to those already planned. To obtain full time subsistance you must aggregate a point total based on % of a point per week, (i.e. for 16 weeks course—l 2 points). The deadline for handing in suggestions is Friday, March 21. Chapter representatives who have conferred with Dean Carman are confident that courses will be added to the present schedule if it appears that a great number of students desire such additions. The tentative schedule of courses for the Summer Session 1947 appears below. Students who desire courses not listed should submit a list of them to the Dean's office in the Southwest wing of the Veterans Affairs Building. These courses are planned so far: 3 WEEK COURSES—lntensive Language June 16-July 5, Aug. 18-Sept. 9 2nd, 3rd, 4th terms of French, German, Spanish * (These intensive language courses must be taken alone). 9 WEEK COURSES June 16-Aug. 15 CC 81, CC B2 Economics 7 and 8 English C 2 and C 4 Government 5 and 6 History 33 Hygiene A1 Hygiene A1 Humanities Bland 2 Philosophy 21 12 WEEK COURSES—June 16-Sept. 4 CC A 2 Humanities A 2 Math 21 and Math 31 SOME SUGGESTED ADDITIONS TO THE 12 WEEK PROGRAM Math 32 and Math 33 English CI and C 3 English 66 (Eng.

31,'Special Collections' Boasts Rare and Valuable Volumes,3 November 1947,"We were killing some time in the Den a while back. Some of us had no assignments to prepare, the others had granted themselves an hour's respite. Conversation had expired peacefully a few sips before a short beer remarked:""Y'know what gets me?—biblio-<S philes!"" The black coffee eyed his roommate paternally as he sighed, ""What's eating you, now?"" ""I was just thinking about how those guys go nuts over old books. Remember how much dough they spent for that Lewis Carrol thing ? And what's less important than an old book?"" It was too late. The loquacious coke had seen the opening, and there was no stopping him. It's funny, but for once he was interesting. ""What good are old books ? You'd be surprised! Ever hear of 'Special Collections?' ... J thought so. It's really called the Special Collections Library—used to be over in Low Library, but it was recently moved to Butler. They've got 135,000 books in that department, easily ten times the number you have in your home town library, and every one is under special protection. Why, each is practically a treasure in itself."" ""I am not batting the breeze — just hold on. Y'know, they've got written records of life in Old Babylonia and Egypt. Just thinkfor a moment. Five thousand years ago, when dinosaurs and sa-ber-toothed tigers traipsed about Central Park, some guy in Asia grabbed his quill, ink, and parchment, or maybe his stylus and tablet—l flunked Ancient History —and wrote down what was going on. And brother, we've got some of those records right here on campus. They'll be around long after you've cashed in. ""In case you don't know, all books printed before 1600 are considered rare books. There are quite a few in 'Special Collections.' In fact, every book there is unique in some way. Maybe the binding is out of the ordinary, or maybe some famous character in history owned it. I'll bet you wouldn't mind owning a book from the library of Lincoln—or Napoleon."" ""A large number of books are themselves grouped in special collections. Just recently, the Library had the good fortune to obtain a 4,000-item collection of Spinoza's works. (You remember Spinoza . . . Humanities A 2). The collection contains the first editions of all of Spinoza's writings, along with hundreds of translations and reprints. One of the donoters, Dr. Corliss Lamont, is a member of the Columbia Philo Department. ""I could go on for hours. There's the Epstean Collection of books on photography, the Joan of Arc Collection, the Seligman Economics Collection, and the Plimpton Collection dealing with the development of text books in the various fields of learning. There's modern stuff, too. Remember those cartoons exhibited in Butler last year ? They were part of the j Pulitzer Prize Collection —no explanation needed."""
32,"Spring Review Rated More Mature; New Poets, Subjects",12 April 1948,"By DAN G. HOFFMANColumbia Review celebrates Spring with a pale green cover, four new contributors, and an issue which returns to literature and the arts for its subjects. This is a better balanced, and, in some ways, a more mature issue thanways, a more mature issue than were the earlier Reviews this year. Nearly everyone who has passed Humanities A should find most of its pages intelligible, and some of them entertaining. A good start in this direction is Ralph Gladstone's ""Translations from the Greek Anthology."" The first two of these epigrams are colloquial and bitter; the others, classical and better. The leading story, Ted Melnechuk's ""Our Daily Bread,"" is a study of a selfish, sadistic, and thoroughly snotty boy on the verge of weighing an average in the Kinsey Report. Such a protagonist grasps us by the gizzard instead of the affections; since his growth into degradation is skillfully presented, one may find some formal satisfaction here despite the tiresome perversity of content. A more profitable subject—the mindless brutality of army life—receives a well-sustained objective treatment and a brutally subtle climax in Martin Woffard's ""On a Sunday Afternoon."" Two new poets, Don Friedman and Fred Duhl, plus John Hollander, Review's old vers libre warhorse, contribute one good lyric apiece. Friedman's ""Pythias""■lightens inward horror with objective wit; this Duhl's ""Frozen Spring"" performs with casual movement. Hollander's ""Little Fanatic"" is a sermon tin a text of which ""he resteth by a brook"" enjoys the happiest expansion. The article by Irwin Mann, ""Poet of Pure Situation,"" comes at the end of both the present issue and the recent craze for Kafka. Since the oracles on the Left Bank of MacDougal Street discovered him, Kafka has been commended to the public in the several images of his critics. Mann reconsiders the root of his subject as well as its latterday branches. This is a well-integrated piece of criticism, as simply phrased and clearly expounded as a mature literary article should be. In ""Art as a Source of Social Understanding,"" Lewis Kurke has, about the morality of ""Don Giovanni"" and of art in general, a good point to make, despite complexities of diction which even as serious a subject as his does not demand. Since its revival 18 months ago, Review has steadily grown in scope and achievement. Twentyfive writers, many of them new, have been published this year alone. We look forward to the annual Boar's Head poetry issue, and to the Reading on May 4th.The April isue of the Columbia Review, the undergraduate literary quarterly, will be distributed starting today in the lobby of Hamilton Hall from 9:30 to 1. It is free to members of the College and is available .to others at 35 cents per copy."
33,Greek Gods Are Haunting Freshmen For 12th Time,4 October 1948,"By MAX FRANKEL '52First to hit the ears of every entering freshman is the phrase ""forty books a year!"" And there follow the stories of the dreaded Humanities! One hundred pages of Rousseau overnight. Whew! Over ten years now freshmen have been reading the classics at near breakneck speed in Humanities A, while the Sophomore continuation of the same course provides study of the two other major art forms, music and art. Early in 1934, a group of Columbia professors who had already made educational history by promoting the famed CC courses, plotted in clandestine fashion for the Humanities A and B. They felt, as they had in the case of the Contemporary Civilization courses, that a college which granted a liberal arts degree should produce educated men; and that as such these men should have a taste of the arts. After their proposal had been rejected once, at long last, on September 23, 1937 freshmen found Humanities A and B among their degree requirements. The course was a perfect complement for the already famedCC's. For as the student studied the philosphy, history and economics of civilizations and institutions he now was introduced, concurrently, to that society's most representative writers, painters, architects, sculptors, musicians, and dramatists. Humanities A reading ranged from Homer to G'oethe and listening in Humanities B from Bach to Stravinsky; while fine arts classes observed structures patterned after the Roman Pantheon or current New York showings. Instructors for the course were snatched from the English Philosophy, History, Classics and Modern Languages departments. It was the second time that Columbia proved to the education world that inter-department cooperation could and should be achieved. The courses which are given to groups of from 20-25 students, boast a series of short quizzes and several essay tests. To refresh some memories, or to impress some others, a sample: Did Herodotus admire Egypt, despise Egypt , never go to Egypt, or die in Egypt? ""Forty books a year!"" Whew."
34,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Humanities B Classes Found Too Large for Discussions,2 February 1949,"Humanities B Classes Found Too Large for DiscussionsTo The Editor: The two year Humanities sequence is intended to be a discussion course, but it seems that the intention has been woefully neglected. Most of the classes in Humanities B are too big and they tend to become lectures. This is in sad contrast in the comparatively small Humanities A classes in which everyone could join in the discussion. If anything, the music and fine arts classes should be smaller, because their appreciation is more subjective and requires more expression of the students' opinion than consideration of literature. As soon as an instructor turns to technical terms and forgets the class, copies of the Spectator or any daily paper become the center of attraction.In fields which are frequently unfamiliar to the student, the instructor's attention is necessary and it cannot be obtained in a class of 35 students. Instead of splitting large sections into smaller classes, the Fine Arts Department tries to move students to other less crowded sections, thus causing unnecessary inconvenience. Wouldn't it be simpler to transfer instructors from the less crowded sections into more busy ones, or increase the total number of instructors teaching the course? Smaller sections would make the second part of Humanities much more than the superficial culture course which we are forced to take now. Humanities B student"

There is another suggestion that I would like to offer, this time about the curriculum itself. Would it not be possible to make the Freshman year easier by offering Humanities B before Humanities A ? The difference of the is not as great as the difference in the time that the work of the courses demand, and surely the music of Palestrina and the art of Amiens furnishes more of a cultural continum with the work of CC A than the writings of Aeschyus. Moreover, CC B reading is lighter than CC A, and this leaves the student time to enjoy the reading as well as get it done in time for the quizzes.

36,Renovation of Barnard Study Is Announced,31 March 1949,"In a major revision of the curriculum, Barnard College has shifted greater emphasis to a broad foundation in the humanities and the sciences. This revision, following more than a year of study and discussion by the college faculty, is the first important change since the present curriculum was adopted in 1925. Abolished by this change are the former general group requirements in the three fields of the humanities, mathematics and the natural sciences, and the social sciences. In their place are more specific requirements, ""which, it is believed, will correct the excesses of the elective system."" The new curriculum becomes effective tjiis September for freshmen, and will be optional for upperclas* lien. Under this new method, students will have to take two fullyear. courses in the humanities, a full-year course in modern European or American history—previously not required; and a fullyear course in the study of contemporary society. The foreign language requirement has been altered so that students may meet it either by the present method of passing a reading examination, or by passing an advanced course in the literature of a foreign language with a grade of C or better."

39,Students to Select Ten Worst Books in Spec 'Lemon' Poll,1 May 1951,"Does Milton's metaphysical mess slip you to slumberland? Does the passe prattling of Plato pain you pitifully? Well here's your chance to put your gripes on paper.> Spectator is sponsoring a poll to determine which books, in the opinion of the student body, are the most boring and impalpable. Students may submit a list of the ten worst books they have ever read, in order of their to Spectator Office, 412 John Jay, any time during the day. The poll will close on -Friday, May 4, and the results will be announced in next Monday's edition of Spectator. Inspiration for this poll came from a postcard signed by oneA. Jones, who requested a list of the ten worst books in the opinion of the student body of Columbia University. A similar poll on unbearable books, this time those generally considered classics, was made last year by ""The Pleasures of Publishing,"" a semi-monthly printed by Columbia University Press. The ten dullest classics were found to be: 1. Bunyan's ""Pilgrim's Progress."" 2. Melville's ""Moby Dick."" 3. Milton's ""Paradise Lost."" 5. Boswell's ""Life of Johnson."" 6 & 7 (tied) Richardson's ""Pamela"" and Eliot's ""Silas Marner."" 8. Scott's ""Ivanhoe."" 9. Cervantes' ""Don Quixote."" 10. Goethe's ""Faust."" Columbia students completing Humanities A should be in an excellent position to compile a list equally as formidable."
40,Why Columbia?,19 September 1951,"""Welcome"" is a word that the Class of '55 has heard ad nauseam in the past few days. By this time we wouldn't be surprised if freshmen are ready to chuck all Jt words of welcome"" for a good murder mystery. At the risk of committing *che journalistic sin of redundancy and boredom we want to add our ""hello"" to the mighty chorus. Welcome, unfortunately begins but never stops at hello; it ends in advice. In this tradition of old-timer advising newcomer over cigars and whiskey, we wish to make a few comments. , • • • Why each member of '55 came to Columbia is probably a mystery. Pop went here; the General has an ingratiating smile; ""Columbia Grad"" is an open sesame to a job; it's away from—or close to—the folks; it might be easier to make Med school; you have an allergy to grass; it has a good basketball team; it has Barnard. Most of the reasons, you members of the Class of '55 will realize, were flimsy ones, but it was a good choice ahyway, for Columbia College is probably the finest undergraduate institution in the nation. • • • The purpose of your education at the College, as you have heard time and again, is to develop the ""whole man."" The Lower College program, consisting of Contemporary Civilization, a course in the development of Western civilization; the Humanities, a study of great books, fine arts and music, and the two-year science sequence will form a broad foundation for your entire future. In fact, Professor Harry J. Carman, f&rmer Dean of the College, has dubbed these courses the ""three-legged stool"" supporting Columbia College. Outside of the lecture room you will find that class spirit at Columbia does not reach the proportions, or excesses, of that at other schools. Emphasis here, is on the person as an individual with his unique combination of likes and dislikes registered, among other ways, in the choices he makes. He should not be a part of a mob with a narrow, single point of view. He is a person who attaches himself to different groups and finds byworking within them both personal satisfaction and growth. , Columbia >yith its academic and extracurricular activities provides the setting for that satisfaction and growth. But in this setting it is up to the individual to locate himself. Unless he looks around for the things he likes to do, Columbia will seem a pretty dismal place. • • • Columbia College is one of the only places left in the world where a premium is placed on the individual, the single person, the ""whole, man."" The old humanist dream of each man a ""Complete unit has gone out of fashion today except on Morningside Heights. Columbia College consists of nothing more than some hunks of concrete, steel and wood; some paper with ink on top and some guys who stand around or sit on a table for fifty minutes and talk. Out of this conglomeration you are supposed to enter a young freshman and exit a mature individual. Whether you get anything more out of this place than a Barnard girl fof a wife and the ability to hold your liquor is strictly your own business. The opportunities for a wonderful life are here. It is entirely your responsibility to make use of them. The next four years may be the best of your life. Here's to them."
41,LION about RADIO,31 October 1951,"By Daniel B. Drachman '53Don't Breathe It —Hear ItWKCR's performance of Oedipus Rex once and for all silences the claim that Greek drama should be inhaled in the manner of a sonorous liturgy—or a mellow after-dinner cigar.Yesterday's production proved that Sophocles' great tragedy can become interesting and intelligible—a fact rarely suspected by hard-bitten Humanities A students, who must struggle through the dense pages of the original Jebb translation. Stripped of it's heavy archaisms and conventionally ponderous though impressive choruses, Ernie Chambers' new adaptation makes very digestible radio fare. Not a small share of the laurels must be awarded to Erik Wensberg '53 for hi.s magnificent work in the title role. Wensberg has had a three-horned dilemma to face in the part of Oedipus. On the one hand, he must give a stately impression, unselfconsciously enunciating in a ""classical"" manner. Secondly, he must avoid the speechiness of the Maurice Evans tradition. Finally, he must run a difficult gamut of' emotion from proud rage through terror and impotent resignation. A perfect example of Wens-berg's success is the way in which he handles the soliloquy at the ""peripety"" of Oedipus Rex—the point at which he discovers he has murdered his father and married his mother. Forceful, gripping . . . what more can be said? Erik Wensberg is without a doubt a mature and powerful actor.Frances Goodwin GS, and Frank Longo '55, as Jocasta and Teiresias the blind seer, play their parts respectably, but without inspiration. Miss Goodwin is perhaps the better of the two, but even she bogs down when the situation calls for a fund of emotional power. Mr. Longo's talents are probably hidden, at least in part, by the aged voice he is required to affect, and he sounds a bit too prosaic for the oracular soothsayer Teiresias. Unfortunately, the lead actors must be supported by someone to play the bit parts. WKCR s extras and lesser players seem to be uniformly unsuited to Greek tragedy. From Creon on down to the first and second Voices, they are far too uninspired and contemporary-sounding' for ancient drama. Further, they all seem to have no knowledge of their vocal limits, and often give the impression of scratchiness, and extreme immaturity. Preceding the broadcast of Oedipus Rex, Professor Moses Hadas and Mr. Dorman Leonard, supported slightly hy Lawrence Janovsky '53 discussed briefly the interpretation of Oedipus and some of the difficulties associated with the text. Oedipus Rex will be rebroadcast over WKCR a 9 o'clock tonight."
42,"Modernized Humanities Course To Include Dostoevsky, Joyce",15 April 1952,"Next year's Humanities A reading list will be revised to include selections from nineteenth and twentieth century literature, Associate Professor of French Donald M. Frame announced yesterday. Works of Aristophanes, Virgil and Voltaire will be dropped from the course to make room for the new readings. Fyodor Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" will definitely be on the list, Professor Frame said. A second book will be added, probably a James Joyce novel. Arguments for including more recent material in the next session proved stronger than those of the opposition among humanities professors. Professor Frame said that ""the department real-ized that important literature did not stop around 1800."" Since the course began in 1937, the authors chosen have dated from around 1800 or back because a need to have more recent authors was never felt. Professor Frame spoke of the ""natural desire"" of the Humanities department to present contemporary authors on the list and avoid ""discrimination"" against them. Contemporary civilization and other such generalcourses include writings from the twentieth century, he added. As a result of the changes, St. Augustine's ""Confessions"" will come at tho end of the Winter Session instead of the beginning of the spring term. It was pointed out that this decision will affect only next year's course and may be reversed in following years."
43,Professor Hadas to Launch WKCR Humanities Program,14 October 1952,"To improve the cultural facilities available to students of both Columbia and Barnard, WKCR has inaugurated a new series of talks on outstanding literary masterpieces paralleling Columbia Col-lege's Humanities A course. Tonight at 9:30, Professor Moses Hadas will launch these radio lectures depicting ""The Great Books,"" with a talk on the Greek dramatist Aeschylus. Dr. Hadas, an authority on Greek and Latin literature, has taught at Columbia for twentythree years, except for a brief period in which he served with the S. Army's O.S.S. He is the author of such works as ""A History of Greek Literature."" Next week, Professor Kurt von Fritz, Chairman of Columbia's Graduate Department of Greek and Latin, will continue the radio lectures with a talk on""The Importance of Guilt in Aeschylus and Sophocles."""
44,Cribnology,16 February 1953,"Many readers who followed our two previous editorials on the cheating problem at Columbia have wondered just how much we know about it. Some sceptics on the faculty and administration refuse to believe that cheating is widespread and a highly developed technique at Columbia. There are also a few non-cheating students who have been too engrossed in their own work during examinations to observe the machinations of the cheaters and would now like to get on the bandwagon before an honor system is possibly installed. For both groups here are a few items from our extensive files: 1) The Microfilm Technique (for literate cheaters). The night before the exam the cheater writes out the essential points of the course in the minutest possible script (thus enabling him to get more notes in a small space and confuse the nearsighted proctors) on white bucks, shirt cuffs, cigarettes, cigarette packages, the inside of their beltstrap, and on small cards stuffed in jacket pockets, shirtsleeves, pants cuffs, the elastic band of socks, inside ties and under watch bands. The greatest danger in this method is the cheater's tendency to write so many notes in so many different places that he sometimes lapses into panic when he can't find the right ones. This inconvenience can easily be eliminated, however, with an index card small enough to be held in the palm of the hand, listing the location of notes on various subjects. 2) The Syndicate Technique (for cheaters with infectious personalities). The night before the exam two or more prospective cheaters meet to discuss various possible cooperative ventures. Two men taking the same course may change seats several times during the exam to look at each other's paper, going to the water cooler together and returning to each other's seat. This inconvenience can also be avoided if the cheater is persuasive enough to induce another student in the exam room to change seats with him. Thus he may sit right next to his cohort and avoid all that running up and dowh the aisle. This practice is especially suited to those who detest water. Furthermore, each cheater may prepare a sheet of notes beforehand, slip them into his blue book where they will also assist his comrade when they change seats. 3) The Early Bird Gets the Worm Technique. The cheater who is able to get up atrushes over to the gym, gets his exam fifteen minutes early, rips it open and discusses the questions with friends more brilliant than he. This enables the ""early bird"" cheater to out-cheat his more lethargic compatriots. 4) The Mercenary Technique. Cheaters using this line of approach may hire a graduate student to take his exam for him or, if the exam is taken in a classroom, hire a graduate student to meet him in the men's room after the exam begins. Here the graduate student gets the questions, works out the answers outside and returns an hour before the exam's end to give the cheater his solutions. This method usually requires a considerable outlay of cash, for the graduate student takes certain risks and thus demands high recompense. The cheater can solve this problem by gathering associates to share in the costs and in the results. 5) The Supplementary Reading Technique. This method is best employed in a classroom exam. Those who read newspapers and books, or those who pretend they do, take a copy of a newspaper, magazine or other periodical into the classroom with notes written on the outside pages or on the covers. (Prospective cheaters contemplating this practice are warned not to use the New York daily tabloids, since most Columbia faculty members have a violent aversion to these publications, which may effect the final grade regardless of the efficiency of the cheating.) 6) The Martyred Moralist Technique. This is used primarily by cheaters who put the wrong facts in the crib notes. Discovering this oversight, they simply ask a sympathetic proctor, who usually supplies the information, but in any case will not report the request. This method should be used only in desperate situations, since, the proctor's memory is rarely better than efficiently organized notes. 7) The Evil Eye Technique. In Naval Science, Air Science and Humanities A, everyone copies from everyone else, so there is no necessity to make elaborate notes or use any of the previous methods. Once in a while, as in Psychology I and Humanities Music this year, a few cagey students are fortunate enough to procure an advance copy of the examination which enables the student to get a very high grade without cheating at all during the examination. This is perhaps the best method of all, when feasible, for who's to know? Non-cheaters of the College, unite! You have nothing to lose but your deferments."
45,Princeton May Up Its Stress On Humanities,23 February 1953,"A move to decrease emphasis on the social and natural sciences at Princeton is being urged by that university's president. President Harold W. Dobbs. acting on behalf of the faculty, will recommend the establishment of a Council of the Humanities at the next meeting of the Princeton trustees, set for April 16. He will ask the creation of a $7 million endowment fund to finance the new group. ""The purpose of the council,"" Dr. Dodds said last week, ""is to strengthen the role of the humanities in the university as the preserver of tradition, the recorders and defenders of the values by which men live, the repository of the experience and knowledge of great cultures and of the behavior of man as an individual and a member of society."" The findings of the new Council's faculty planning committee revealed that more than twothirds of the time, talent and funds available to Princeton during the past 25 years have been allotted for the natural and physical sciences."

47,FRESHMAN'S COURSE GUIDE — YOUR PROGRAM THIS YEAR,16 September 1953,"The Columbia College catalogue for this year lists 344 undergraduate courses given in the College. Most of these courses do not concern the average freshman who must make out a program. For those with ordinary high school preparation, there are about 20 courses from which some sort of logical program must be compiled. As a service to the Freshman class, the Columbia Daily Spectator has printed on this page information of a more detailed nature than is ordinarily found in the College calatolgue about these courses as well as some general information which may help new students in the composition of a program.The College Catalogue The College catalogue contains an alphabetical listing of all courses offered by the College Faculty. Almost all courses which are open to freshmen are found in this listing. Course titles preceded by the letter 'R' (which means ""reverse"") are given in inverted order, that is. the first half of the year course is given in the second half of the school year, the spring term and vice versa. Courses preceeded by the letters, G.S., are given under the School of General Studies and special permission must usually be obtained for these courses. Sections Are Divided The sections of the various freshman courses differ only in respect to the time at which they are given. These sections are usually redjvided into sub-sections for smaller classes. In most such courses, there is little way in which you can 'pick' your instructor. Air Science 101 Around the world in two semesters with a dashing Air Force Captain who interprets a standard geography text, ""World Political Geography."" The junket spends time on Russia, the NearEast and other interesting places. Particular attention is paid to recent governmental and population problems. The course requires about three hours of preparation a weeek and is taught in lectures followed by five minute question-and-answer periods. Five-minute short-answer quizzes are given about once a week in addition to a rigorous mid-term and final, which, among other things, tests map reading and drawing. Few, if any, take this course without being members of the AFROTC unit. Astronomy 1 Astronomy is a deep, tough and —for those who study hard—a very rewarding course. What with highly complicated math work involved, many quizzes, and extensive memorization, the course is rarely recommended for those who are not truly interested in the matter. Botany 1 Most .of those students taking the Botany course don't intend to be botanists—they are merely fulfilling their science requirement, and Professor Edwin Matzke, the department head and instructor tells you so the first time he sees you. Everyone in the class is immediately won over and from there on it's Prof. Matzke's show. The class itself meets three times a week, including a two hour lab, 4 hours in all. Most of thework for the course is done in class with the emphasis on lab work, centering about microscope work, plant classification, etc. Notetaking is very important. Chemistry Chemistry is a subject best reserved for the budding scientists and avoided by those looking for an easy way out of their science sequence. There are three elementary chemistry courses open to the Freshman depending upon their previous training in the field. For those who have done well on their chemistry placement exam Chem 9 is a fine course. It not only covers the introductory inorganic material but also includes work in qualitative analysis and exempts the student from the regular qualitative analysis course, Chem 11. Chem 9 is not an easy course by any means and will require a good amount of work. Chem 3 Available Chem 3 is a regular inorganic chemistry course intended for those who had one year of high school chemistry and who either do not want to do the work of Chem 9 or have not rated high enough on the placement exam. For those who missed taking high school chem, Columbia has come to their rescue with Chem 7. This course involves more time than Chem 3, and may, in fact, seem like quite a prodigious undertaking to the neophyte chemist. He is relieved of his added burden the following term, however, when he moves in with the former Chem 3 students to take the Chem 4 course. Contemporary Civilization This is a two-year sequence required of all students in Columbia College. The course is taught by an inter-departmental committee of the faculty. Sections usually do do not have more than 20 or 30 members. The proportion of lecture and discussion will vary from section to section with the instructor, but the student should count on being prepared to a greater or lesser extent in discussion on the various readings. There are two texts for the course: the source book, and the ""readings,"" the emphasis is on the source reading. They vary in length but a night's work is usually about 20 to 30 pages of reading, usually fairly heavy reading. Papers Required In addition to the readings and class discussions, the course includes papers of medium length and, of course, a mid-term and final. These have invariably been of essay type and ordinarily there is not particular emphasis on historical facts and figures. In general, the tenor of the course is determined by the individual teacher and his field of interest. Students planning to continue work in the social studies would do well to take C.C.in their first year since many, if not most, courses in history, government, etc., have this course as a prerequisite. English English A1 is required of all students in Columbia. This course, as might be expected, consists mostly of the writing of themes, about one a week on the average, and some class discussions. What happens in the classroom usually varies widely from section to sec-tion. Sections are even smaller than those normally of C.C. or Humanities. Geology A1 A very interesting course and a fine way for non-science majors to fulfill part of their math-sci-ence requirement, especially if they prefer not to spend hours in the lab. Professor A. K. Lobeck teaches the first half of the course which includes general geology. Slides and Professor Lobeck's excellent drawings help a lot. Professor Taylor teaches the second half of.the course which goes into somewhat more details. The laboratory sections are taught mostly by geology graduate students, and are usually quite good and interesting. Health Education A1 This course tries to do a lot for the freshman. In addition to solving problems of sex and sociability, it raises new broblems and questions. For those taking the course and its purposes seriously, there is a lot to be learned and gained. The course, run on a small class basis, makes ample use of student discussion, films, and guest lecturers. The teaching by fairly young, understanding instructors, is very liberal in every respect. There are a set of rather interesting readings to be done, and some kind of project must be completed. Humanities The Humanities two-year sequence is part of the required ""core"" curriculum. The first year of Humanities need not necessarily be taken before Humanities B. They may even be taken concurrently and those wishing to spread the Lower College requirements over three years often postpone the entire sequence for a year. In fact, slow readers would be well advised to use some such ar-rangement and not take C.C.and Humanities A at the same time. Humanities A is primarily a reading course, which begins with the classics and ends in the 19th century. About one book a week is the assignment and these may run from 60 pages of Greek plays to several hundred pages of Don Quixote. The emphasis in on class discussions of the material read. In addition, there is a regular weekly quiz, usually multiple-choice, on l the book due for that day, thus ostensibly assuming that nobody falls too far behind. Class discussions are made possible 15V very small classes, usually around 20 or so. Humanities B Humanities B is divided into two parts: Humanities FBI, covering fine art, and Humanities MBI, music. Both these courses are taught in small sections. The Fine Arts course makes extensive use of all sorts of visual aids: slides, drawings, museum trips, etc., to trace the development of art from the pyramids to Picasso. No previous knowledge of art appreciation or technical terms is assumed but these are learned during the term. Reading for the course is fairly minimal. Papers may vary slightly from section to section, but all are required to take several museum trips. Use Recordings The Humanities Music course, as might be expected, makes extensive use of the Music Department's phonograph record collection. In addition to class work, there are listening sessions under the tutelage of graduate music students which are quite helpful. Reading is minimal. For those interested, the music room in the college study, (in back of the card catalogue), has phonographs with earphoftes but its selection of records is fairly limited. Those on campus may make use of the Humanities music programs broadcast on WKCR which are integrated in varying degree with the course. Towards the end of the term, the whole week of classical music broadcasts is given over to 'cram session.' Languages Proficiency in at least one foreign language is required of each Columbia graduate. The basic sequence in each case is a two year course, labelled, for instance, French Al, A 2, 81, 82. In general, the Al, A 2 courses, which meet five times a week, require 30 minutes of homework every night, and weekly quizzes are given. The work in the 81, B2 courses concentrates less on the fundamentals and more on reading and speaking the language. In the French course this aspect is taught very well by the use of recordings, tape recorders, special pronunciation sessions. Read Great Classics In the German course, the student, after two years of instruction, has a better grasp of reading techniques than of speaking or writing. In this course, however, the great classics of the language are read in the second years; in most of the others the more important works are not introduced until the third-year sequence. Mathematics The mathematics sequence a year of which you will be required to take if you choose not to take both a laboratory science and a non-lab science—begins with tri-gonometry and runs through differential and integral calculus to the most advanced graduate courses, on gamma functions and probability integrals. The usual lower college courses are these: MATHEMATICS Al—Trigonometry. a three point course required if you did not take this course in high school. For this reason, it is given at often inconvenient hours and only in the Winter Session. MATHEMATICS 21A—Analytic Geometry and Differential Calculus, a three point course which will be the math course taken by the largest number of students.: In general, high marks do not, come easily in this subject; many of the instructors develop the theoretical sides of the subject but neglect many of the practical aspects of the subpect. : Between thirty and sixty minj utes of homework, much of ifc routine, is assigned every night; not every teacher will mark it, although it is always corrected, since its primary purpose is to drill the techniques involved. Naval Science 10] The glorious traditions of the United States Navy are sounded in this course. Rigorously cffarting the history of naval power from Bible times to the present, an occasional instructor, who is usually a Lieutenant Commander has been known to stray and tell personal sea tales. The fifty minute sessions are usually given as straight lecture, with little questioning. In addition a short orientation of naval procedures, such as when to salute, is presented before the regular historical analysis weighs anchor the third week of the term. Like air science this course stresses memory of specific historical data, and its tests, about twice a week are of the short-answer nature. The euphemism in the catalogue for marching drill is ""Laboratory."" Physical Education The Physical Education program at Columbia covers three years. The first two years are divided into eight quarters. The student must take two quarters in an individual sport, (such as bowling, tennis), two quarters in a team sport, (baseball, basketball, football) and one quarter in a combative sport (fencing, boxing or wrestling). The two years are rounded out by tlpree quarters of electives. The classes in all sports are a combination of expert instruction and actual participation. They are not, however, drill periods. 'Cuts' Disqualify As in all courses which meet : three times a week, the maximum' unexcused absences, or cuts, al-] lowed per term is five times, with: two latenessness, always recorded in gym classes, counting for one 'cut.' In Phys Ed, however, 12 'cuts,' excused or otherwise, force a student to lose credit for that; term of the course. All medical! excuses, sprained muscles and: such, must be submitted through the Medical Office in Earl Hall. Physics Whether a disciple of Newton, or a relativist in the Einsteinian school, Physics 3-4 will answer your needs admirably. It will not satisfy the pre-Engineering requirements or the requirements for any of the professional fields dealing largely with physics. The course, in its present form, is slanted, heavily, toward the his- : torical side of physics, with great-; er emphasis on general principles | and scientific thinking than on | details of formula manipulation, j"
48,Establish New Kinne Prizes In Humanities,25 September 1953,"The Humanities Department has inaugurated a new program of annual awards this fall with the presentation of twenty prize books to deserving members of last semester's Humanities A course. Established in memory of French Professor Burdette I. Kinne who helped institute and develop the Humanities program at Columbia, the award carries with it a stipend of $5 to be used by the recipient towards the purchase of a book of his choice. The prize is awarded, according to Professor Hibbet,. a friend of the late Professor Kinne and one of the originators of the prize, to the student in each Humanities A section ""who shows alertness and originality in thinking, who gets excited about thought and its development through literature in civilization, to the kind of people Kinne looked for."" • Proceeds for the awards are drawn from a fund established by former colleagues of the late professor."

51,Dean Opposes Honor System; Cites Tensions Classroom Exam Results Encourage McKnight,19 February 1954,"Classroom Exam Results Encourage McKnightBy Newton FrolichDean of Students Nicholas McD. McKnight said yesterday that ""the results of final examinations held in classrooms were encouraging"" but aserted that he would not be in favor of an honor system unless ""an investigation of student opinion showed that students were almost unanimously in favor of it."" The Dean released statistics showing that while exams for 84 of the 162 college courses were given under the supervision of instructors outside of University Hall, 80 percent of all examinations taken by Columbia College students were in the gymnasium. He noted that such courses as Contemporary Civilization A and Humanities A accounted for the great number of individual exams in the gym. Dean McKnight asserted he is against the honor system because ""the lack of adequate facilities in Hamilton Hall would only add to the already present pressures on students in making the system difficult to implement."" Discussing instances of cheating during the final examinations last January, Dean. McKnight noted one case in University Hall and one in Hamilton Hall. ""In both these cases,"" the Dean said, ""the offending students were expelled."" He cited a third instance of classroom conduct which, through investigation, revealed no dishonesty. ""This instance does, however, illustrate how the less standardized procedures in the classroom arrangement increase the chance for situations which look like dishonesty,"" the Dean said. ""There does not seem to be a feasible way of moving the lower college courses of large registration out of the main examination hall,"" he continued. ""There are only 14 classrooms in Hamilton Hall, each of which can accommodate an average sec-tion of 25 students seated on an every-other-seat basis,"" the Dean explained. ''Since, for example, there are some 25 sections of Contemporary Civilization Al, all the students would not be able to take the exam at the same time. This would create greater administrative problems than we have now."" The Dean doubted whether anyone would prefer the idea of students sitting next to each other during a final examination, because of the tension that it would tend to create."
52,POINTS OF INTEREST Lion About Town,4 March 1954,"Lion About TownBy Robert R. SirotyPanel on Columbia Above a photograph of Metropolitan New York in the Columbia College announcement is the caption,. ""Laboratory for the University."" How this ""laboratory"" has housed the great project that is Columbia is the theme of a fascinating exhibit nowon display at the Museum of the City of New York, sth Avenue ""between 103 rd and 104 th Streets. Entitled ""Knowledge for Free Men—Columbia University, 1754-1954,"" the exhibit has individual displays for each of the twenty-three schools of the University, depicting: their early days, their latest developments, and New York in the era of their founding. Today's Columbia College is represented by selections from the Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses, including copies of the Spring 1953 Humanities A 2 and RFBI final examinations (with answers), considered one of the high points in the show. The College of yesteryear occupies the feature spot in the exhibit which takes up the two south galleries and part of the hall of the third floor of the museum. A Gilbert Stuart portrait of William Samuel Johnson, first president of Columbia College and son of the first prexy of Kings College, overlooks the portrayal of the school of 1754.A smaller picture of the earlier Johnson, and a portrait of Samuel Verplanck, first student to register in the College, commemorate the beginnings of Kings College in 175.4. Another view, twenty years later, of an excerpt from the New York Gazette and Weekly Mercury of May 17, 1774, is also given: concerning commencement, ""The Discourses upon this occasion did great Honour to thePerformers, who justly merited and received universal Approbation."" The financial struggles of the infant college are illustrated by a portrait of James Alexander, who in 1756, gave the first bequest of 100 pounds to the school, and by a sketch of the lotteries held to raise money for Kings College. A set of instruments resembling a carpenter's tool kit contrasts the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the 1780's with the modern equipment of P & S today. The instruments, consisting of a drill for boring into the head, a ""bone saw"" which very strongly resembles a coping saw, although its blade is thicker, and forceps for removing bullets, belonged to Dr. Charles McKnight, chief physician of the American Army of Revolution, and later, professor of surgery at P & S. Also on display is the earliest extant P & S diploma, belonging to Benjamin Onderdonk, and conferring on him, .in 1771, the degree of Bachelor of Medicine. The document is signed by the Reverend Myles Cooper, Tory president of Kings College, who later had to flee, in his nightshirt, from a howling mob of student revolutionaries. This scene is depicted in another panel. The well known ""book-burning"" incident is recreated vividly in one panel of a series entitled ""Famous Incidents in the History of Columbia University.""It seems, so the story goes, that in 1882, the editor of the yearbook, ""The Columbiad,"" so successfully carried out his editorial statement, ""We sincerely hope that everybody referred to will feelinsulted and never Famous Incidents Panel speak to us again,"" that distribution of the book was banned. President Frederick Barnard of Columbia decreed that whole issue be burned in the College furnace. The drawing- shows President Barnard supervising the incineration of the books by the editors.

A life size model of a Barnard girl, dressed in the costume of a college lass of 1889, highlights the Barnard exhibit. The annual ""Greek Games"" share much of the spotlight with this very proper young lady, scenes from the pageants of 1904, 1906, and later years being depicted. The Barnard-fence-busting also shows up with a photograph of Herbert Hawkes, late former Dean of Columbia College, measuring a gaping hole in the barricade. Dean Hawkes was presumably estimating' the cost of repairs. The Columbia exhibit idea was first conceived by Ralph R. Miller, Assistant Director of the Museum, who says that ""I've learned more about Columbia since this exhibit started than I ever thought existed."" A dismantled miniature model of the show, which served as the floor plan for the finished product, occupies one corner of his office. The exhibition, which closes March 28, (and with it, go the Humanities exams) is open to the public daily, except Monday. Admission is free.

53,REVIEW OF COED POLICIES Barnard Head Favors Coed Upper Classes,22 April 1954,"Barnard Head Favors Coed Upper ClassesBy Herb KleinIn recent interviews on the advisability of college coeducation, President Millicent C. Mcintosh of Barnard and Dean of Students Nicholas McD. McKnight of Columbia College both saw advantages to coeducation on an advanced level, and objections in the case of more elementary courses. It was clear, though, that Mrs. Mcintosh favored more extensive coeducation than Dean McKnight. Mrs. Mcintosh said. ""For older students, juniors, seniors, and graduates, I am strongly in favoi of coeducation."" Speaking of the relationship between Barnard and Columbia College, she said, ""I am personally •in favor of planning the advanced •work for all departments on a joint basis . . ."" Currently, some advanced college courses are coeducational •here. Also, in a few departments, notably music, even early courses are taught jointly. Otherwise, Barnard and Columbia courses are taught separately.' ""I do not approve of uniting all of our courses . . ~"" Mrs. Mcintosh continued. ""It seems to me that freshmen and sophomores do more work if men and women are studying apart from each other, and that they therefore get a better start in their whole academic life than if classes were combined from the beginning."" Dean McKnight favored, ""an arrangement through which theundergraduate students, both men and women, can have the full social advantages of association with each other, but which does not extend to coeducation in courses, except those of an advanced character."" He said that he preferred not to define explicitly what undergraduate courses are advanced. As for courses at Barnard and Columbia, Dean McKnight said, ""I would not object to some increase of coeducation in appropriate areas."" Dean McKnight is a member of the four-man joint committee with Barnard which meets from time to time to discuss the pos-sibility of further planning of courses on a joint basis. Dean McKnight objected to the distractions which he felt would affect students in coeducational classes. He said that coeducation was sensible on the graduate level where the concentration is on the subject matter, but that on the college level, where most of the .emphasis is on the student, separate classes were a better policy. Dean McKnight said that students in coeducational classes would be more self-conscious. If coeducation were extended to lower college courses here, he thought, men, being more aggressive, would be apt to dominate discussion classes such as Contemporary Civilization, leaving the women to take a back seat. The Dean also expressed the opinion that the presence of women in Columbia classes would dilute a desirable sense of common membership and comparable objectives among the students of Columbia College. On this basis, he opposed the admission of Barnard students to what he called ""characteristically Columbiacourses."" As an example, a Barnard student might be admitted to an advanced science course, but not to a ""characteristically Columbia course"" such as Professor Mark Van Doren's ""The Narrative Art."" Mrs. Mcintosh predicted. ""I feel certain that within the next 25 years there will be a great increase in cooperation between Barnard and Columbia College. Perhaps I am optimistic, but this cooperation seems to me to makeso much sense that I feel certain that it will increase."" Dean McKnight hesitated to -predict whether coeducation would increase here. In support of coeducation for ""older students, juniors, seniors and graduates,"" Mrs. Mcintosh said, ""I believe that there is considerable intellectual stimulation for such students in the discussion of ideas when the point of view of both sexes is represented. I also think that at this point, study habits have been sufficiently established so that the coeducational element is not distracting."" However, Mrs. Mcintosh said that planning advanced work for all departments on a joint basis would not necessarily involve joint classes, but would in cases where the enrollment was small, or when some specialized aspect of a subject was involved. She noted that cooperative arrangements are more economical than if Barnard and Columbia make their plans completely separately. Notes Advantages Dean McKnight, too, said that he recognized the advantages which coeducation presents of being more economical and of making available the point of view of both sexes in classroom discussion of ideas. He cited the Humanities A course as a course in which women might have particularly pertinent remarks to make on the morals questions which are raised in the class discussions. He said, however, that the objections to coeducation for undergraduates outweighed these advantages. ""The advantages of coeducation are largely found outside the classroom,"" Dean McKnight said, ""the disadvantages in the classroom.""President Millicent C. Mcintosh of Barnard, who said recently that she strongly favors coeducation for college juniors and seniors.Dean Nicholas Mcß. McKnight"
54,Lion About Lit,24 September 1954,"By Gerry PomperLiving and Learning ""A History of Columbia College On Morningside,"" ed. by Prof. Divight Miner, 284 pages, Columbia University Press, $4.00. With the Bicentennial now nearing its last orgasmic spasms, the University Press is publishing a lasting memorial to the anniversary celebration—a 19 volume history of our 200-year-old institution. Closest to our hearts is the history of Columbia College, written by six capable gentlemen under the guidance of Dwight Miner. Lionel Trilling begins our tale as the College is being threatened with extinction. The German beliefs in the values of strict scholastic training were becoming widely prevalent. John Burgess was suggesting—and many influential personages including the olympian Nicholas Murray Butler were agreeing—that the College be used for little more than a preparatory school for the vastly more important purposes of the mushrooming University. Opposed to this view was the newly-installed Dean, John Howard Van Amringe. As Prof. Trilling tells us, he ""fell back on the Renaissance ideal of the whole man, and on the ideal of the gentleman, of the honorable and responsible citizen of enlightened and gracious mind."" Fortunately for today's undergraduate, the Dean's view ultimately proved the winner. Today, the Columbia student knows he will spend four years learning not only a craft for the future but also the ultimately more profitiable art of living. Professor Trilling tells this story of struggle and ultimate victory in a carefully constructed neat style whidh imparts to the reader all of the emotion and rational argument caused by this conflict of titans and theories. He then passes the symbolic pen to professor Justus Buchler, who draws for our wondering eyes a picture of ""Reconstruction in the Liberal Arts"" at Columbia. We see a course instituted during World War I, entitled ""War Issues"" miraculously become ""Contemporary Civilization"" and we watch it develop into the foundation for an entire structure of education. We read, feeling a personal identification, of how John Erskine developed his ""Colloquim on Important Books"" into ""Humanities A."" And, at the end of the chapter, we express our own sen-"

56,Once Is Enough,2 December 1954,"When we pass the small groups of undergraduates gathered around the forboding tentative final exam schedules our minds wander to thoughts of the middle of January, University Hall, gongs, blue books, 'and test questions. It is no secret to most students and fac,'ulty members that many of the questions 'appearing on these final exams, as well as on mid-terms and quizzes, are often repetitions of those on former tests. We characterize these circumstances as among the most Unfortunate situations existing on campus. For those who have access to fraternity 'or other back files, this situation is very pleasing because it often guarantees them a substantial portion of the correct answers. Those who do not have these advantages, 'however, find themselves in grossly unfair Competition with their scheming, exambrowsing classmates, often receiving lower marks than they would receive if all students began the examination on an equal basis.. We have heard some persons express doubt or, at least, surprise that such a condition exists. This incredulous group includes at least one member of the Deans' Office. After some research we have found that: / Half of the midterm examinations in basic French and German courses are frequently repeated at different hours of the exam day. Although the parts that are repeated are not readily memorizable, nevertheless many important points may be gained by approaching friends Who have taken the tests at earlier hours. (And what of the poor dupes who have had the misfortune of being examined early in the morn?) Thirty to forty percent of organic chemistry exams are repeated from previous years. Questions in Chemistry 9-10 and Psychology 1-2 examination papers are repeated, chough not often to a great extent, from tests of other years. Short answer exams in Comparative Literature 43-44, have often been duplicated in toto from past test papers. The same Humanities A quizzes are given to the different hourly sections of the course. The only justification we can see for repeating exams in full or in part, is thatmaking up new tests is both difficult and time-consuming. We realize this and are duily sympathetic, but as long as exams and marks continue to be stressed excessively in this school, everything possible must be done to make certain that they are as fair as possible. One of the most unfortunate features of this system is that test repetition is most prevalent in the science courses where marking curves are most formalized and high marks more sought after. We ask the Deans' Office, department heads and individual faculty members to attend to this unfair situation before the forthcoming final exams. The administration is attempting to reduce unfair competition in exams by eliminating cheating. We hope it will extend this policy by removing the evils of repetitive exams."
57,Prof. Frame Announces 28 Winners For Kinne Awards,9 May 1955,"Twenty-eight students in the Humanities A sections have been awardad Burdette Ingersoll Kinne awards for distinguished scholarship, Professor Donald M. Frame of the Humanities Bepart-- ment, announced last week. < The awards, consisting of a prize book for each winner, were instituted in 1953 to perpetuate the memory of French Professor Burdette I. Kinne who helped institute and develop the Humanities courses. Professor Kinne died in 1947. Under the original plan, a prize •book goes to the one student in each section of the Humanities A course deemed most deserving by his section instructor. However, this rule has now been made more flexible, and thus some sections may be alloted two awards and others none, depending upon the quality of the students. Recipients make their own choice of a prize book, the award covering up to maximum of $5.00 of its cost. 'The books carry a specifically-designed bookplate and are obtained at the Columbia University Bookstore. The winners this year are: George H. Braman '5B, Edward A. Buckley '5B, Robert L.

58,Lion About Drama,13 October 1955,"By Gabriel SpergelFor many years the Columbia ] Players have been turning out many fine performances that have ■been both artistic and enjoyable. Last night was no exception to the rule. Jean Anouilh's ""Antigone"" and George Bernard Shaw's ""The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet,"" j two one act plays, were presented last night in McMillin theater before a small but enthusiastic opening night audience. Whatever was lacking in polish the | Players made up for in eagerness. ""The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet"" is the wild west story of an honest thief who is .about to be lynched for the theft of the sheriff's horse stolen under the mistaken notion tha.t it belonged, to Posnet's erring brother who is now a respected citizen. He is saved only through the evidence of a lady of doubtful morals and of another virtuous soul who insists she no longer desires, to .be so. .Our hero r seems sorry -to go free and walks off ""hand in hand' with the lady of ill fame.G.B.S's play thus runs true to the Shavian philosophy of cynical intelligence but is certainly not one of his best. It is full of his renowned wit and seemingly shocking immorality. Shaw is continually stating in the words of his hero that ""there ain't no good and there ain't no bad"" and accepts the view that politics is power and, action, and, though it may be cruel and violent, that it is often necessary—ideals must be subordinated to reality. Mitchell Smith turns in a fine job in the title role, cursing himself and God with the right feeling. Milburn Smith is wasted in his neatly performed role of ""Boozy"" Posnet, alias Elder Daniels, the hero's hypocritically reformed brother who is now a respected member of community life. The Sheriff in the story is well played by Jerry Strauss and the rest of the cast is adequate but enough so. Judith Yedlen needs more practice in the role of the town prostitute but she certainly played her part with a bounce. The major work of the evening was the ancient Greek tale of ""Antigone"" done over in modern dress by a modern author but still the same old story familiar to all Columbia men as a part of Humanities A. ""Antigone"" is the story of Oedipus' daughter who defies the order of the newly crowned king, Creon. not to bury the body of her traiterous brother, which is putrifying outside the city's walls. Antigone is a lady with a need to express herself and die in so doing. In her resolve she leads the royal family to the depths of tragedy. Vida Farhad plays the title role with deep sensitivity and feeling. Her role is a very rich one and she makes the most of it- with her soft and beautiful voice. Michael Goldman enjoys the role of the uncle, Creon, the man overwhelmed by his job and his duty. ""Somebody has got to captain the ship"" Creon states and if to say ""Yes"" to duty means sweat and to say ""No"" means waiting and cowardice one must say yes despite all consequences. Goldman gives a convincing performance of a man saying ""Yes"" in spite of all that follows. In his play, Mr. Anouilh invents a most convincing character, a king's guard, a tough guy, who speaks with a Bronx accent. In midst of all the tragedy, this role, well-played by William Bouris, gives the only bit of humor and reality to the whole play. This does not mean to say that the play'is any the less convincing because of the lack. Disillusionment, duty, and moral choice are all well brought out, but as mudh credit for this must be given to the actors and director as to the author. The author, in a carry-over from the Greek tradition, uses a one man chorus in the person of Michael Metzger, who, dressed in a tuxedo and spot-lighted on an otherwise dark stage, is very effective, as was the supporting cast. The settings by Richard Mason are excellent and the lighting and choreography are satisfactory. Robert Goldsby, who directed ""Camino Real"" and ""Murder in the Cathedral"" last season has continued his fine record. My most serious objection to last evening was the qcestion of why the Players are willing to spend so much obvious time and effort in the production of the Shaw play when they certainly could have chosen a work more suitable to their talents even if it were not more well known. Shaw obviously did not think much of it for he did not lavish as much care as was usual for him in his works. While the performances were good the play was not, and the Players could have done much better with a little better material. They don't have to present works that hardly anyone has ever heard about just to be different.'Anligcme'"
59,WKCR To Request Approval for FM Campus Radio Station Will Broadcast To Large Part of New York Area,10 February 1956,"Campus Radio Station Will Broadcast To Large Part of New York AreaBy Jack BarkWKCR will apply early next week to the Federal Communications Commission for permission to operate an educational FM station. Once approval of the application is secured—FCC action•is expected sometime in April the campus radio station will broadcast to Manhattan, Northern New Jersey, and parts of Queens and the Bronx from 7-12 P.M. Mondays through Fridays and '8-H.l P.M. on Sundays. The student-run station's programming calls for the introduction of new programs to augment some of the old favorites. The schedule will present, as it does at present, news, classical and popular music (the latter to a limited extent), dramatic works, and programs strictly concerned with Columbia. To Highlight Humanities Among the programs that will be presented during FM hours are ""Music Through the Ages,"" a program designed for Humanities Mei students, but which includes material other than that covered in the course; ""Great Books,"" which features lectures and discussions by members of the Humanities A faculty; ""Faculty Footnotes,"" a new program in which members of the history, government, and economics departments will discuss current problems. The popular ""King's Crown Concerts"" of classical music will remain in its 10-12 P.M. spot. The new transmitter will be located on the top floor of Philosophy Hall. It was bought last semester for $100 at an auction of the Armstrong Estate. Dr. Edward H. Armstrong, who invented FM in 1933, died in 1954. All programs will originate in the Hamilton Hall annex, where WKCR will have three studios, the last of which is now under construction. Since no commercials are permitted on educational FM stations, WKCR will substitute special announcements to outside ■radios at the same time as the commercial messages are fed to the dorms. Columbia's FM station will be the only completely student-run unit in New York City. Fordham University, the other New York school with an FM station, employs professional engineers. The application for the FM license will be filed through the Trustees of Columbia University, the University's corporate title, under the authorization of President Grayson Kirk."
60,Lower College,22 February 1956,"The Lower College program as developed at Columbia is designed to ""provide each student with a broad and substantial foundation in the chief fields of knowledge."" With the; re-institution of the majoring system, and economic superordination of the scientific professions, the Lower College program in the humanities and social sciences is becoming increasingly important as the nucleus of liberal arts education. In all too many cases the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities sequences constitute virtually the only basic liberal arts education enjoyed by College students. Unfortunately, however, the courses in these sequences, as offered here, fall short of their goals. A student who allots the customary 28 required credits to C.C. and Humanities, and who has no more room in his program of studies to djevote to the humanities and social sciences,, finds himself shortchanged. He finds that although the readings and subject matter in general are rewarding in themselves, the overall treatment is inadequate. He finds himself thrown into a discussion group in which the instructor often knows little more than the students. The; ""effectiveness of a proved instructor"" which the College Announcement cites as one;of the benefits to be derived from the Lower College course is lacking. The fault, of course, derives from the basic ""inter-departmental approach"" to the Lower College teaching combined with the inherent impossibility of getting instructors who, are experts in, or even students of all the subject matter covered in the wide scopes of the Lower College curriculum. Asa result, a German instructor who will probably excel in directing the study of Faust falls down in the field of Greek Classics, the English instructor falls down on Moliere, the sociologist has his troubles with Hegel, and the philosopher has his headaches with Durkheim and Malinowski. One solution to this problem would be to convert Humanities A and C.C. to large lec-ture-hall courses with specialists in the various fields delivering their insights. The lecture approach, though, might go somewhat against the grain of established Columbia educational philosophy, which stresses learning through discussion. Consequently, a major step toward the alleviation of the situation would be a departure from the current practice of shunting the younger, less experienced instructor into Lower College required course teaching and then releasing him at the end of a year or two, leaving next year's students to begin again with an inexperienced teacher. A group of C.C. and Humanities teachers is needed—pedagogues who, in addition to mastering their departmental specialties, will be experienced with the material and methods of the required ""core"" courses. Immediate steps should be taken to implement this improvement by assigning more veteran instructors in place of the present novices. Their increased pedagogic experience and deeper intellectual background would lend immeasurable aid to the furthering of the aims of the. Lower College program. If the courses cannot be made more effective in this way, and the problem of not being able to find persons adequately familiar with all facets of the C.C. and Humanities curricula would therefore still exist, the College should seriously consider supplementing the discussion classes with weekly lectures by especially qualified specialists. A professor familiar with the individual aspects of the subject matter under discussion in a given week could lecture to several sections at a time. There is.certain background material which is basic to the course readings in question, and which ought to be forthcoming from one source or another. So much of a student's liberal education depends on Humanities A and C.C. that it is unfair to condemn him to a class in which the instructor and instructed alike flounder on the rocks of the all too important subject matter."
61,Letters to the Editor Polite But Severe ...,1 March 1956,"Polite But Severe ...To the Editor: Your editorial today on the Lower College is a polite but severe indictment of our interdepartmental ""core"" courses on (the grounds of staff incompetence. 1 should like to reply on behalf of the Humanities A course, though most of my remarks apply also to the Contemporary Civilization sequence. Those of us who have some responsibility for these courses are much concerned with student opinion, favorable or unfavorable, and eager to ascertain it as accurately as we can. Though I am certainly not impartial, I have studied it as detachedly and as thoroughly as I could. All the evidence I have found argues directly against your major premise that students generally find our core courses disappointing. The suggested alternatives—large lecture courses or lecture-cum-discussion-group courses—have of course been considered here, tried out elsewhere, and .generally found much less satisfactory to teachers and students alike. The danger of incompetence, though admittedly great in a large course such as ours, is common to any course that steps across departmental boundary lines. It is a calculated risk. What we seek in our staff is the fresh spirit of the amateur as well as the competence of the professional. We do not always- get all we seek. But what surprises me is how few of the complaints I hear are of incompetence. The problem of getting and keeping the best possible teachers is a big one. The other legitimate claims on some who have taught the course but no longer do are simply enormous. In my opinion, the departments that participate in Humanities A .are all as considerate of the welfare of the course as of their own departmental needs. Your picture of young instructors being ""shunted"" into Humanities A and then ""released"" after two years is like a photographic negative of the truth. All are carefully screened by their departmental representative and the course chairman; all teach the course because they want to. In short, I think the picture you give of the core courses represents the exception rather than the rule. I have strong reasons for believing them •to be vigorous, vital, and generally successful. If you have strong evidence to the contrary, I very earnestly ask to know it. Though we may flounder on the rocks, we are more eager than you may realize to flounder in the right direction. Donald M. Frame Feb. 22, 1956 Chairman.. Humanities A CED. NOTE: // the editorial gave the impression that ""students generally find o-nr core courses disappointing,"" then we are at fault for' poorly conveying our thoughts. We believe that most students, including o-urselves, are very satisfied with the Humanities and Contemporary Civilization sequences. The editorial was meant to deal with one aspect of the courses, i.e., the sometimes dull and uniformed instruction. This is by no means the rule. But we feel the sizeable number of exceptions to be worthy of attention, and in the editorial, proposed possible solutions.)"

64,Letters to the Editor What's the Rush?,8 October 1956,"What's the Rush?To the Editor: In reference to your editorial of October 3, 1956, concerning Student Board's approval of SAC's changes in Soph-Frosh Rush rules and programming, I find myself in agreement with the ideals and principles stated, (but find that the ""enlightened aims"" of the SAC office deal more skillfully with ideals than with hard organizational problems. I am sure that both SAC and Student Board are aware of the difficulty incurred in getting sophomores to show up at the Hush when it all took place in one day. Now they have spread the Rush over a period of three consecutive days with apparent disregard for such pressing matters as C.C. B. Chem 11. Physics 3, Humanities A, History 9, and all the other courses taken by sophomores. Does SAC expect all of us, freshmen and sophomores, to drop everything and rush to a beer party on Wednesday, to Baker Field on Thursday, and then to pay $1.50 to go to a dance on Friday so that we may terminate the rush in a ""nice, peaceful"" atmosphere? This charge of $1.50, in itself, will keep many Sophomores out. It is felt that we ought not to pay for something which has from time immemorial been free, that is, the songfest. I don't see how this ""camaraderie"" which you have written about will be attained if the sophomore attendance will be limited to those in the claes government, those in the dorms, those who can afford the luxury of three days of neglect of their -work, those who can or are willing to pay $1.50. I sincerely believe that not many of the sophomores fit in the above-mentioned categories that that soph attendance will hit an all time low, thereby defeating SAC's purpose. It is time that SAC became less idealistic andmore practical and that Student Board look into proposals with a more critical eye. It is to be hoped that both the Board and SAC will review this matter and rid us of some, if not all, of its evils. Peter Korican '59 October 4, 1956 * * *"
65,The Heart of the Matter —I,31 October 1956,"( This is the first of two editorials dealing with the teaching problems in Contemporary Civilisation and Humanities. On Friday, we will discuss possible changes in the teaching structure of these ""core courses.) A Columbia College professor last Spring described the problem of the ""core"" courses —Contemporary Civilization and Humanities in the, following terms: ""The. real problem is the problem of the teacher. We must get the top men ... to teach the course. Teaching C.C. and Humanities ought to be the reward for the great teacher, rather than a way of elevating the good teacher."" The dilemma is, indeed, one of the teacher. In what for most Freshmen is their initial introduction to the Columbia College curriculum, they are more often than not confronted with a comprehensive and challenging course, presided over by an eager but uninspiring young instructor. After poring over a fascinating excerpt from, say, Newton, the Freshman may find the edges of his mind blunted by a discussion leader who is working for his Ph.D. in Government, and considers Newton the least of his worries. The situation, obviously, may be traced back to the ""inter-departmental"" approach of both the C.C. and Humanities A programs, which cut across fields in order to present the student with a broad, liberal background and possibly to guide him towards advanced work in a particular area. With these programs as such, we have no complaint; we consider them imaginative and valuable introductions to the type of liberal education with which Columbia so successfully provides us. But with, the methods of instruction we are deeply concerned. The ""core"" courses necessarily encompass a wide range of subjects. Thus, after a year of C.C, the student will have been exposed to anthropology, sociology, psychology, physics, history, government and philosophy; two semesters of Humanities A will have left him with a taste of Homer and Faust, St. Augustine and Dostoevsky, Job and Moliere. This variety of fields presents a challenge even to the prominent, experienced professor. One of the top men in the Humanities Department, who has been teaching the course for almost two decades, has remark-Ed that he spends twice as much time in day-to-day preparation than for any other subject. What is most distressing is the plain fact that the teaching of these courses has not been the cherished province of the old-time professor. Rather, it has been entrusted, in large part, to the young and eager instructor, whose ambition is often, though not invariably, several years ahead of his ability. Figures embracing an average of the past six Winter Sessions show that for every Faculty member (assistant professor and above) teaching Humanities A, there are two Junior officers (instructors and lecturers) . For every man teaching the course five years or more, there are two who have spent less than five years with it. One out of every four Humanities teachers is confronting the course for the first time. We have reason to believe that an analagous situation exists in the Contemporary Civilization department. The ideal solution, of course, would be the one suggested originally by our professor— that is, get the top men to teach the ""core"" courses. But this is easier said than done. Most of the ablest experienced men are occupied with their more specialized upper college courses and the various administrative chores which are the lot of the university professor. They simply have not the time to teach more than one or two Humanities or C.C. sections, it indeed they are able to do even that! And certainly we would not recommend that these outstanding men drop their upper college specialties in order that they monopolize the ""core"" courses. The thought of Shakespeare without Andrew Chiappe, or Plato without Charles Frahkel would incite the most placid upperclassman to the verge of mutiny! A means must be found of combining the intellectual acumen, sharpened by long years of practice, of the faculty members, with the unbridled willingness of the young instructors and lecturers. Only under an improved, revised pedagogical program, can the C.C. and Humanities courses truly become the first life-giving kiss on which the Columbia student will build his intellectual dream."
66,The Heart of the Matter —II,2 November 1956,"The present method of teaching the two required - ""core"" courses of the Columbia College curriculum— Contemporary Civilization and Humaniites A—is defined in theory as a discussion-group arrangement. Under this set-up, a class of between 15 and 30 students meets four times a week to converse with, rather than merely listen to, the instructor or professor who will eventually determine their grades. More often than not, these eager students, most of them first-year men, will find a young instructor rather than an experienced faculty man standing at the head of the classroom. In inter-departmental subjects such as C.C. and Humanities the need for a trained man is indeed great. With a variety of fields to be covered in rapid succession, the class is often left to a teaching beginner, who has only begun to master his own particular subject. The current system is as unfair to the imtructor as it is to the student. While the teacher must struggle futilely to attain the omniscience which is required of him by the very nature of the courses, the student finds himself in a profound muddle, as he compares what he has so diligently read with what his instructor is trying so valiantly to say. The most ideal solution to this problem is, unfortunately, little more than an ideal. That is, to assign to all of the top men the C.C. and Humanities A sections. But because of their more pressing obligations to their upperclass specialties and because of the various administrative chores to which they are subject, these experienced men are simply unable to devote more than several hours per week to the ""core"" sections. As a practical means of lightening the intellectual load on the young instructor and providing the student with a more provocative academic diet, we suggest that the present system of four ""discussion"" classes per week be revised in the following manner : Each section of C.C. and Humanities A would meet on Monday in hourly groups (all nine o'clock sections, etc.) in one large room. They would then be treated to a lecture by an expert in the particular field which has been assigned for the coming week. For example, if the C.C. topic for the week were in the field of economics, Professor Carey might deliver the lecture. If the Humaniites sections were studying Homer, Professor Hadas would probably be called upon. Following the Monday lecture, the various classes would return to their small discussion units for the three remaining periods during the week. There are, of course, objections to this proposed revision, but they are, we feel, not sufficient to erase the gains which a lecturediscussion system will provide. An inspired lecturer will infuse the student with both a clarification of what he has read and a sound basis for further discussion. Several objections have been noted by Professor Justice Buchler, former Chairman of the C.C. Department. It is to Professor Buchler's reservations that we will now address ourselves. Professor Buchler has written: ""Where the lecturer and the discussion leader are different persons, the student >:s faced witha problem ... he is involved in the mechanics of adaptation. The intellectual temper of the two instructors is likely to dtffer, and the student is obliged to re-establish rapport each time he goes from one to the other. If the difference between the two instructors is pronounced, the student .is faced with the task of reconciling one intellectual idiom with another . . . the discussion or at least the student's consciousness, will more frequently focus on the meanings intended by the lecturer than on the subject directly . . . The discussion tends to become ■the subordinate procedure . . . In reply, we wonder how beneficial it is for the student to have only one viewpoint presented to him on the various works he has read—and that viewpoint ofttimes none too well informed. Is it not better to have divergent approaches to a subject? It that not in fact the very rationale for the whole discus-sion-group program ? And does not the student, in turning from the introduction to the instructor, or from one student speaker to another, have to reconcile ""one intellectual idiom with another""? Would it be so difficult for the student to make one further reconciliation —and this time with a broad and mature intellectual idiom ? As- for the preponderant importance that could attach to the lectures, we do not feel the enactment of our proposal, which would devote only one-fourth of the class time to lectures, would seriously detract from, but rather considerably add to the significance of the discussions. Professor Buchler further points out: Can the instructor ... be versatile enough to get along w.ithout passing the ball regularly to ""experts"" (meaning ""lecturing specialists"")? In Contemporary Civilization the student carries the ""experts"" under nis arm along with bis sources . . . His own instructor is an expert in at least one domain and has been selected because he is assumed to know both the language of scholarship and the language of young students ... . In response, we must first note that only in the first year of Contemporary Civilization does the student have the benefits of any lecturers under his arm; in the Humanities sequence and in C.C.B there is nothing comparable to the ""Chapters"" volume; no army of experts has been massed to provide essential background for the students interpretations. It is true that each instructor is an expert in at least one subject, but to whom can the busy student turn when his instructor is not dealing with his"" own particular subject? How solid a foundation can the student receive from economists grappling with Erich Fromm, or Latin teachers encountering Dostoyevsky? And what is the student to do when he comes up against a rather parochial scholar, a sociologist, for example, who simply is not interested in economics? We do not claim to have discovered the perfect cure for an ailment which is strikingly peculiar to the C.C. and Humanities departments. But we place confidence in a revised method —one which will combine the virtues of a powerful lecture by an astute interpreter with.the benefits of exciting and thought-provoking discussions. Only through pedagogical revision will the ""core"" courses truly awaken the Columbia student to the broad and liberal offerings which are inherent in their composition."
67,Letters to the Editor In the Beginning,21 November 1956,"In the BeginningTo the Editor: A recent two-part editorial suggests that Humanities A is badly in need of an expert and seasoned staff and concludes with a recommendation that we revise the course in a fashion which would make it indistinguishable from the ""humanities"" or ""general education"" programs which are springing up all across the land. It is proposed that a weekly lecture toy a specialist toe supplemented by three conference meetings with a section man. Alas, that Columbia men should know so little of the blessings that are theirs! First, as to sttaff. It happens to be the case this year thalt more than half the staff is of professorial rank, and that two-Uhirds of its members already have their doctorates. But it is more important to note that of those who do ndi yet wear these academic hash marks only two are new to the course this year and that the remaining seven men average six years of (teaching in Humanities A. Student generations are ephemeral, and I must conclude that the Question you have raised about the eager and ignorant instructor has to do with impressions formed some time ago. Even if this is so we ought to note that a turnover of twenty-five per cent in the Humanities A staff is hardly alarming; in fact, iJt is evidence of a heartening devotion to collegiate or interdepartmental aims on the part of the several departments and the men involved. But the recommendations as to the use of senior experts to lecture does raise a genuine educational issue: are we to adopt the popular and economical device of having a brilliant lecturer address masses of students in Humanities A? I object: (a) that Humanities A isn't anybody's professional specialty, and that the works read ought not to be treated as segments of somebody's professional specialty; <to) the section man whose work is framed toy the lectures of a specialist is not giving his own course. This last point is vital. The development of a rapport with a small group for which the instructor is solely responsible is of the essence of Humanities A, and & is the very thing most admired toy educators who visit us. Such a small group develops a context for itself; becomes aware of the qualities and resources of its members; acquires intellectual manners (for example, whjch of two questions about Antigone illumU nates the play, and which leads you into the toogs of sociological speculation?) T suggest that the editorial followed a figure of speech to a perfectly logical, and factually erroneous, conclusion. Humanities A is not a ""core."" It is a beginning. It is reading indispensable books for the first time with a devoted gentleman amateur (if you like) to guide you toward an answer to the question: What does this vision of life or this intellectual stance mean to me here and now? Of course you and the instructor are incapable of answering this question once and for all—and of course you must try, for if you don't the western tradition will not be yours to command in any sense. iNo brilliant lecturer can forever defend you against this obligation. And you ought to assume it at the beginning of your college career. QuenHin Anderson Chairman, Humanities A. November 14, 1958 * * •"
68,The Heart of the Matter—III,21 November 1956,"""How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child."" Those anguished words of one of Shakespeare's characters seem to reflect the feelings of two of our faculty members as expressed in letters on the adjacent page. They imply that our proposal that lectures to supplement discussions in Humanities and Contemporary Civilization betrayed a lack of appreciation for the merits of Columbia's discussiongroup method of education. We are considerably distressed that we should be cast in the role of ingrates who have either plodded our way through Columbia utterly unscathed, or have failed altogether to grasp the values of whatever scathing we may have received. Perhaps this misunderstanding is partly our fault; perhaps, in our limited space, we did not set forth our views with adequate clarity. But now we must set the record straight. We are glad that the letters of Professors Anderson and Webb have given us an opportunity to affirm our gratitude for the exciting educational experience at the same time that we reiterate our previous suggestion We see no contradiction in this: we should hope that the faculty would not want our gratitude to be wholly unqualified, nor consider a call for some modification in the dis-cussion-group approach an outright denial of its many merits. We believe that extremism is particularly regrettable on so subtle a topic as this; and we are sure that neither of our correspondents wants us to be convinced that discussion groups alone are the only or the perfect means of teaching any subject, no matter how nebulous its purposes, or no matter how extensive its syllabus. ' We first of all welcome the tidings from Professor Anderson that the percentage of professors on the Humanities A staff is on the increase; this will go a long way toward alleviating the problem. Both professors strongly imply that the purpose of these courses is only to inculcate certain ""attitudes."" But we must ask if the College, by making this its sole aim, is not denying much of importance to the pre-engi-neering or pre-medical student, who will have little time later in his college career for further contact with the humanities. If he is not enthralled by the subject matter he encounters in the lower college—and that requires the ablest of teaching—we can hardly expect him in later life to interest himself much in literature or the social sciences. We recognize that ideas have their proper province in the discussion group, and we did not want to call in the experts to rescue the student from the perils of arduous thought and disputation. The expert would not seek to furnish a final authoritative interpretation; he would merely make a contribution to more informed discussion in the separate sections by grounding the student a little more firmly in his own ample knowledge of a certain week's topic. 1 In C.C., for example, he might replace to a large extent the Chapters in Western Civilization, or in Humanities, he might outline the historical and ideological context in which certain works had been prodused; that way the student could better understand what a particular vision of life meant to its author before he had to decide whatit should mean for himself. The expert would merely provide a sounder foundation on Which the students themselves, guided by their discussion leader, would still continue to climb painstakingly their own intellectual mountains to seek a revelation for their own lives. The expert would be only supplementary, like the introduction to a text; the discussion leader's ""leavings"" for the discussion would still be the most vital part of the course. We feel that the communication from Professor Webb deserves particular treatment. We can well admire his vigor and eloquence; he starts swinging at the opening bell, and keeps throwing powerful punches right till the very end. But unfortunately much of this seems to be only shadow-boxing; he succeeds only in demolishing some hideous straw men we would never have dreamt of erecting. For instance, he appears to throw his choicest haymakers at us because he thinks we are espousing obviously discredited theories of education; but is there no middle ground ? Must we 'be ranked with the infidels simply because we do not sing loud and clear hosahnas for the discussion group as the Last Word in academic perfection? We are disturbed by much that he says. Himself an eminent expert in his own field — British history—he mercilessly deprecates the expert. Yet we wonder if he would consider his courses more valuable if they were entrusted to admitted amateurs? He seems to dread the possible controversies that would arise from a lecture-and-discussion system. Then why should we lift a finger for academic freedom, if teachers will not openly challenge each other because they fear cold glances across Faculty Club luncheon tables? He hails the intellectual fruits of confusion. But is there not a point at which confusion becomes senseless, when the student is victimized by the amateur instructor who can do no more than show him how to scratch his head fretfully? He points out that each section should be the sole possession of jts instructor. But are our section leaders really that sensitive about supposed encroachments on their sphere of authority? Shouldn't the decent scholar recognize those who have greater learning than he, and defer to them when the occasion demands? We are even more upset by the many logical inconsistencies of Professor Webb's argument. He deprecates our students as barely able to get into their notes the gist of a lecturer's statements. Then how receptive does he expect them to be for such subtle things as the ""attitudes"" he champions? He says that we err in assuming (what we did not assume) that there is a body of truth to be handed down from teacher to student; yet he then avers that the teacher must develop the student's ""respect for facts and truth""—truth that may not even exist, and facts that are apparently unworthy to be allowed into the general education classroom! And on top of all this, he denounces us for our ""pontification."" In any event we affirm our faith in our proposal—as well as our faith in general education at Columbia. We are well aware of what Professor Anderson terms ""the blessings that have been ours;"" but we are also aware of the greater blessings that could be the Columbia student's in the near future."
69,Unproctored Exams Favorably Received Poll Shows 'Honor Attitude 'Experiment In Humanities Midterms Successful,3 December 1956,"Poll Shows 'Honor Attitude 'Experiment In Humanities Midterms SuccessfulBy Barry DickmanInitial reaction to the ""Honor Attitude"" seems favorable, judging by the answers given on questionnaires filled out by students who took the unproctored Humanities A exams during the recent> midterm period. These polls consisted of five objective queries and three more general questions. Students were asked to comment on the success of the unproctored system, and to tell how they felt about the ""Honor Attitude"" as it applied to class and to personal affairs. According to Gary Angleberger '57, chairman of the Student Board Honor Commission, 55 i questionnaires of the 124 distrib- : uted were returned. Only 14 freshmen responded, with 39 ! members of the Class of '59 and three juniors also answering. Freshmen appeared to be mostoptimistic about the future of the ""Honor Attitude."" Sophomores displayed more indifference, and many sophomores and juniors were doubtful about the plan's practicality. ""The attitude of honor is the test of a truly mature individual . . . which we should all strive to attain,"" noted one freshman. ""I would be even less apt to cheat if I were put on my honor,"" commented another. This uncritical outlook and optimism about the possibilities of furthering the concept of honor in College men predominated among freshmen. On the other hand, a typical upperclassmen's response noted that ""on the whole 75% of the Columbia students are honest,"" and wondered ""What can you really do to change those who cheat?"" Other students questioned the applicability of the ""Honor Attitude"" to the examination situation. One pointed out ""If the need be so great for cheating,there is nothing wrong with the students' attitude, but with the system that causes it."" From the few students who expressed a completely unfavorable attitude to the idea came such comments as ""If one has not acquired a positive ethical code by now in his personal affairs he can only be pitied,"" and ""Since there is no indoctrination, as soon as the newness wore off cheating would begin again."""
70,SB to Survey Faculty A bout 'Honor Attitude',11 December 1956,"By Barry DickmanA faculty poll will be the next step taken towards the achievement of an ""Honor Attitude,"" Garry Angleberger '57, chairman of the Honor Commission, announced at yesterday's meeting of the►Columbia College Student Board. 'Supplementing the questionnaire filled out by students who took the recent uproctored Humanities A examinations, the faculty survey will be distributed to all College teaching staff members. From this poll, the Commission hopes to discover the exact feelings of the instructors who gave the proctored exams about the ""Honor Attitude."" In addition, the poll will serve to introduce the attitude to the entire College faculty. In the remainder of his report, Angleberger saw little hope for a change in the present methods of administering proctored final exams until students call for the change. Stimulating such a movement is one purpose of the ""Honor Attitude,"" he added. Going on to another aspect of ""honor"", the Board recommended that complaints be submitted to the Board if any activity ""detrimental to the name of the College"" was observed at basketball games. Cursing opposing players and drunkenness were cited as examples of ""detrimental"" conduct.Under its constitution, Student Board has judicial powers in regard to flagrant violations of sportsmanship, and* can suggest disciplinary probation as a punishment. Following the lead of alumni groups, the Board declared Dec. 20 as ""Lou Little Day."" A dinner honoring the retiring football coach will be held that night."
71,"Spotlight: Harvard's Noble Experiment Radcliffe Manages to Coexist Peacefully, Helps Promote Joint Instruction Concept",14 January 1957,"Radcliffe Manages to Coexist Peacefully, Helps Promote Joint Instruction ConceptBy Stephen S. FybishThe visitor stands by the subway ent ranee, a fifteen-minute ride away from the ddwntown section of a great Eastern city, and feels very much at home as he spies the venerable Ivy League dormitories spread along the street to his right. While sidewalk trees swish in the chill wind, overcoated you ng men hustle past bookstores and cafeterias, or join housewives at the adjoining bus stop. And not a few can be seen hailing variousyoung ladies —complete with 1 ■two-tone school scarves —who enjoy their own ample share of the educational resources afforded by a renowned university. Since the sign overhead reads ■""Harvard Square,"" the nostaligic newcomer quickly senses that the interacting folks he's watching don't go to Columbia College or Barnard. He has certainly been struck by the resemblance, though. Now he recalls something about CC-Humanities style group of General Education courses, and an especially piquant academic setup in which Harvard and Radcliffe students have coed classes, but call it ""joint instruction."" Boasting such curiosities, he feels, Cambridge may help him judge more freshly the familiar undergraduate scene at Morningside Heights. The visitor grasps notebook and valise, and sets off in search of Truth. * * * Cosmopolitan as its ideals are, Harvard is heir to an austere New England'past which gives it a breed of modernity flowering amidst Puritan gardens. One feels that when change occurs here, it cannot fail being the •proper change for Harvard. Evidently the 1943 development that initiated joint classes for Harvard and Radcliffe came, if anything, a good deal later than it might have. Radcliffe was founded in 1879 —ten years before Barnard—and its pioneering students were from the start taught by members of the Harvard faculty. These ■worthy pedagogues would often deliver a lecture at 9 A.M. to Harvard College men, then swoop across expansive Harvard Common to the Radcliffe ""yard"" and, between gasps for breath, offer the feminine scholars the identical discourse promptly at 10! Radcliffe was nonetheless a separate corporation possessing its own endowment, so it handled the teachers' pay. Millenium Comes Over six decades the Radcliffe girl received a fine education and the inevitable scorn of the Harvard College student (""Was that a Radcliffe girl I saw then, or did a horse step on her face?"" etc.). The enrollment grew to number 800 by 1943 yet few avoided playing second fiddle in popularity to Wellesley, Smith and Vassar misses. In view of this prior condition, the pleasant after-effects brought on by jointinstruction are striking. That insidious change came swiftly, when World War II shrank the size and leisure of the faculty until the logic of coed classes could no longer be ignored. At first, just upper-level courses were combined; by 1946 almost all of the once sacrosanct Harvard classrooms threw open their doors to Progress, and the changeover was completed in 1953, quite painlessly. The after-effects?—A boom in Radcliffe's appeal to high school seniors. Even discounting the nationwide postwar surge, the quadrupling of applicants for admission since 1943 has been remarkable. And the College's neterogeneity also soared, with New Englanders comprising less than 40% of today's student body, instead of 66%. Overall enrollment now stands at 1400 girls, a 75% increase, yet the average IQ of entering freshmen has risen simultaneously. Barnard Differs At this point it might be well to take brief stock of the differences in the pre-merger relationship between Radcliffe and Harvard and the parallel situation ofBarnard and Columbia. First, Barnard has always possessed a separate faculty. Secondly, its enrollment of noncommuting students is at present limited by the available dormitory space. . Third, the ratio of women to men students here is about 1:2; in 1940 at Cambridge it was 1:5, so the ""increment"" of girl students was not so noticeable. Lastly, the whole Lower College program at Columbia, emphasizing specific required courses, differs from the more flexible Barnard arrangement. Any ""mass movement"" towards joint instruction would thus require an altered educational philosophy on the part of one school's administration, at least. ""Gen Ed"" Radcliffe's President, W. K. Jordan, did express some fears of this sort—that ""huge crowds in the required General Education courses would be unwieldly."" However the problem stayed controllable because the ""Gen Ed"" courses taken by any student may be selected from a range of six or eight approaches within each of the required fields—Humanities, Social Sciences and Na-tural Sciences. Where Columbia College has one set Humanities A curriculum, Harvard offers a range from ""Epic and Novel"" to ""Uses of the Comic Spirit."" Nonetheless, even such tempting diversification does not keep numerous Gen Ed courses from having several alarming traits. Recalling chronic Columbia interest in the possibility of weekly lecturers to accompany CC and Humanities discussion periods, the writer eagerly visited a Harvard Social Science course whose contents—""lntroduction to the Development of Western Civilization"".—seemed most like those in CCA. CC For the Masses? The lecture took place before a modestly sized horde of 350 or so students, including about 75 girls, in a hall which must have contained a thousand seats. Although one might have logically expected the Cantab football team to charge out before this assemblage, the guest of honor was simply a professor who spent the hour neatly describing the medieval monastery. (Considering that the information thus tendered could have fitted into three pages of a CC source book, its merits were wasted upon this reporter—who instead noted sociologically the relative attention shown by the Radcliffe and Harvard students present and gave the former the laurels.) Whatever the implications of Harvard's curriculum for Columbia, the overall scholastic performance of the ""Cliffites"" involved, and the character of the extrascholastic relationship they have with Harvard College, is a shining encouragement to suffragettes at Barnard and elsewhere. Radcliffe's gracious Dean of Instruction, Mrs. Wilma Kerby-Mil-ler, neatly summed up the faculty viewpoint: ""In the three, lower classes, 52% were on Deans' List with an average of B or better . . . What women's colleges have done is to give women a chance to teach incollege, but we have a new society in this country. Integration has certainly been helpful in the case of Radcliffe."" After praising the Barnard faculty and student body, Dean Kerby-Miller cautioned that, although integration in itself is a good thing, curriculum discrepancies would need to be worked out first. Would the girls be too docile in classes with a male majority? I don't think that's true of the kind of girl who goes to Barnard. In classes here with only two to seven girls, they hold their own."" Eager to Learn Said Harvard Dean of Freshmen McLaughlin: ""You can assign a Radcliffe girl anything in tutorial."" As a student during the period of initial joint instruction he noted surprise ""that this didn't happen ten years earlier."" Students at Harvard echoed Dean McLaughlin's respect for the Radcliffe intellect, albeit they tended to see some Cliffdwellers as ""grinds."" Matter-of-fact acceptance of the ladies' classroom presence is the rule. But legends crop up about thesensitive graduate of Philips Exeter who threatened withdrawal from the class of '60 because the stuff about girls at Harvard was smuggled into the small print of the catalogue. On the Radcliffe side, various students queried seemed content with their lot. Emphasizing that they had their own publications, sudent government, athletic association and similar groups, they felt no particular ""submergence"" by the male population majority. Socially, the ratio is nqt without is pleasures, and the marriageoriented Cliffite has a 50-50 chance of finding her eventual spouse across the Common. And Coffee. Too! Among the miscellaneous traits in the Radcliffe culture pattern are an exceptional refinement of social behavior and a widespread employment of bikes for trans-portation of Belle and Books to the daily scenes of academic ritual. At ten minutes or so before supper, the neophyte is treated to the spectacle of several score two-wheelers racing through the peaceful Cambridge streets en route to nutrition. Then too, the inevitable coffeehour- exists, under the alias of ""Jolly-Up,"" to help mar spontaneity between the sexes and impede the effect of joint education. Dormitory regulations at Harvard are more liberal on the subject of visitors than Columbia's, but the rules over at the peacefully Georgian Radcliffe residence halls have the same stringency as those from Barnard to UCLA. One major advantage the two ■Schools boast, an overwhelmingly resident student body, gives them a chance to develop a ""collegiate way of living,"" to quote old grad Cootton Mather, via dormitorycentered activities and resident tutors. (Apparently some discontent about lack of individual attention crops up notwithsanding.) The Harvard repuation and facilities remain an awesome lure annually .to high school seniors, and top-drawer publicity organizations makes sure that the news spreads around the country. Dollar Worries Radcliffe is short on scholarship funds; result —it ranks number one or two among all women's colleges academically, but the admissions office laments a paucity of entrants- from families earning less than a very comfortable income. Relative to theirmale counterparts, however, Barnard and Radcliffe both stand on similar healthy pars when the brainpower potentials are added up. Yet the share-and-share alike curriculum may get out of hand imminently in Cambridge, 'tis feared. Last month the ""Harvard Crimson"" featured a story ruin or i n g the installation of R.O.T.C. training units at Radcliffe. Hastily the ""Radcliffe News"" canvassed the situation, and reported it to be mere poppycock. (Cried one miss, ""ROTC for women is a symbol of the decadence of America."") For the"

73,Two Centuries of Columbia College From a Trinity Church Back Room to a 'Subway Sorbonne',15 March 1957,"From a Trinity Church Back Room to a 'Subway Sorbonne'By Arthur LouisThe second in the line of British Hanoverian rulers issued a special charter on October 3-1, 11754, sanctioning Dr. Samuel Johnson's tiny college in the city and colony of New York. The college was given the name King's College, as a self-imposed tribute to George 11. Today it is called Columbia. Columbia College, nonsectarian throughout its history, is the fifth oldest undergraduate institution of higher learning in the United States. The oldest is Harvard, and that was founded even before Bunyan wrote Pilgrim's Progress. By the charter's stipulations, .King's College was to provide a ""liberal education."" It was not to be a mere trade school, a craft guilS: It was, and is, a repositoryof the liberal arts, where a man may take a long hard look at what his predecessors, scholastic and non-scholastic, thought and made of the world. King's College, its name changed to Columbia College in 1784, when the last traces of British rule were seeping back across the Atlantic, spent its first century in the shadow of dark old Trinity Church, which still stands today north of the Battery near Manhattan's southernmost tip. In 1857, the College shifted to 49th St. at Madison Ave. Soon after its uptown move, during the reign of Columbia President Frederick A. P. Barnard (1864-1&9'7), Columbia sprouted a host of graduate and professional schools, all, more or less, functioning to this day. Little Columbia College becamestifled in this melange of brother schools, and very nearly met a tragic end. Barnard himself doubted the sagacity of retaining the College of Liberal Arts. He felt that the modern trend in education was a reversion to ultra-specialization. Fortunately the earnest efforts of the next Columbia President, Seth Low, prevented Barnard's near mistake. Lofw took the College to permanent quarters on Morningside Heights, where it displaced the31oomingdale Insane Asylum. The Golden Age of the College, ;he true heritage of Columbia ;oday, had begun. When Lowwas elected Mayor of New York City, in 1901, he was succeeded by Nicholas Murray Butler, who, with Dean Howard Van Amringe, initiated a flock of familiar Columbia institutions. Between 1904 and 1927, the three undergraduate dormitories were completed. Hamilton Hall, the seat of liberal arts study at Columbia, was erected in ISO?. The Van Am statue and quadr rangle were posthumous tributes to the Dean, who died in 1915. In 1901, Jester, the humor magazine, joirred Spectator (founded 1877), and Barnard College (1&89) in the collective effort to stimulate the male undergraduate. In 1304, Van Amringe started the Faculty Advisory System for Columbia College students. For over forty years Butler led and enriched Columbia. He was almost single-handedly responsible for most of the buildings on campus. There was meager space for them, hut t'hey were sorely needed, and the facile tongue and countless contacts of ""Nicholas Miraculous"" exhumed the funds for their construction. Appropriately, the library dominating the south end of the campus was named after him. In lQ'lO, Contemporary Civilization A was added to the Columbia curriculum by Dean Herbert Hawkes. In 1928, a second year sequel, C.C. B, became a requirement. These, coupled with the Humanities A (1937) and Humanities B '(1947) courses, form the ""core"" of the Columbia liberal arts education. A man named Eisenhower became Columbia University President in 1948, and when he decided to look for another job in Washington in 1952, he was succeeded by present President Grayson Kirk. In 1950, Government Professor Lawrence Chamberlain replaced Harry Carman as Dean of the College. Simultaneously a new post, Dean of Students, was created and assigned to Nicholas M. McKnight, whose retirement last semester vacated the position. Throughout its two centuries ■Columbia College has hosted such diverse notables as: revolutionaries Alexander Hamilton and John Jay; statesman De Witt Clinton; Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo, one of the younger of the ""nine old men""'; artist Rockwell Kent; diplomate V. Wellington Koo; publishers Simon and Schuster, Knopf, Bennett cerf. Mozart's operatic librettist Lorenzo da Ponte, the immortal Philosopher John Dewey, and three members of the multi-talented Van Doren family 'have tried their hands here as faculty members. The history of Columbia College is a long, proud, and full history. The College gives indication of forever responding satisfactorily to the exhortation in the second verse of the Alma Mater: ""Long may Columbia stand, honored throughout the land, our Alma Mater grand, now and for aye . . ."""
74,The Way to Make a 'Whole Man' Versatile Individual College’s Aim,15 March 1957,"Versatile Individual College’s AimBy Robert BurdThe living heart of an educational institution is its curriculum. A university must stand or fall on its curricular program. While the Columbia College program of studies seeks to develop a well-rounded ""whole man"" it also aims at producing an individual who is trained for a specific field of interest. In the first two undergraduate years the student acquires a 'broad general education which will lay the ground work for his upper college years, and more importantly will present a picture of man's development—his achievements and his foibles. The core of the general education program are the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities courses. The student also broadens his horizons by taking two years of science and a foreign language. After an educational experience which stresses a great deal of factual information, the freshman is suddenly thrust into a world of concepts, and after a short time he thrives on them. Contemporary Civilization is aptly described as ""a study of the major political, economic and philosophic influences that have shaped the character of Western Civilization.""Through source readings the student is confronted with the major ideas of Western man— concepts from which modern society has sprung. Great thinkers who formerly wee only names —Aristotle, Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Marx, Hegel, Voltaire, Locke—■ now materialize and their thoughts provide a stimulus which challenges and excites thethirsty minds of Columbia College students. Major movements in man's dynamic history are illustrated by a study of these ideas which ultimately were the prime movers in the evolution of the modern world. The second year of Contemporary Civilization concentrates on man in his contemporary setting. Twentieth century man, often aconfused creature, is analyzed ■ and dissected in readings f by such renowned social scientists as John Dewey and Sigmund Freud. The two-year humanities sequence tells man's story through his art, literature, philosophy and music. Humanities A is an exhilirating course in which the student is taken on a grand tour of the classics of world literature and philosophy. Complete works by Eomer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, yirgij, Plato, Dante, Rabelais, Shakespeare and others, are studied with a view.toward helping the student develop taste and judgment through penetrating classroom discussion of the works read. e humanities course not only introduces the student to much that is new but also sheds new .illumination on such familiar works as ""The Iliad"" and ""Hamlet."" Inherent in the aim of Humanities is the desire to sweep away misconceptions and cliches about the famous books. 1 <]Tns ""whole man,"" however, is tiot complete until he has been exposed to the masterpieces of -fine arts and music, which constitute the second year of the humanities sequence. Towards Appreciation These courses give the student tools with which he is able to analyze, and ultimately to appreciate—for what appreciation can come without understanding? This sequence of core courses quite often proves a determining .factor in a student's choice of a major field of concentration. They lay the foundation and form the stepping stones to a more specific knowledge of a particular subject. The Columbia man, having acquired his general education, which also includes physical education, English composition and health education then goes on for study in his field of concentration. The diversity of the courses seems overwhelming to the student who first scans the catalog, which contains rare treasures culled from approximately 41 departments in the College alone. F:r those students with a flair ifor the more exotic, there are .opportunities to take courses in almost all of the graduate schools -,of -the university and in the School of General Studies. Language scholars have . a heyday Columbia offers more •languages than any university <In the country. Those interested can take courses ranging from jnodern European through ancient Greek to obscure African. The College has instituted a majoring system to make sure th£: the student graduates with knowledge of a specific field. A major constitutes 24 points in one field with 12 points of study in ■ a related field. .Dilettantes need not worry, however, for there is a great deal of room outside the major to take other courses. For instance, many students take such additional subjects as Oriental humanities and contemporary civilization, or the famed colloquium, which is a two-year study of great literary works from the ancient world and the modern. What more could any curriclum hope to attain?Two Columbia College Students at a Physics Lecture. Awake or Asleep, They're Always in Love with Learning."
75,"Basic Courses in Lower College Provide Educational Background Parents to Observe Advanced Subjects, Core Classes Today",12 February 1958,"Parents to Observe Advanced Subjects, Core Classes TodayBy Michael N. ShuteWhen the Columbia student attends his first Contemporary Civilization or Humanities class he undergoes his initial encounter with the effort of Columbia College to provide its freshmen and sophomores with a basic educational background for their specialized ventures in the upper college. The most prominent of the numerous of ""core"" courses the Columbia freshman must face is Contemporary Civilization A, which parents will see taught today by Professor Miner and Mr. Rothschild. Using the writings of important political and philosophical figures such as Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, Voltaire, Hegel and Marx as source material, CC A attempts to provide the student with a knowledge of the fundamental economic and social foundations of Western Civilization. Then, in Contemporary Civilization B, usually taken in the sophomore year, the student is introduced to a variety of explanations of the social enigmas which confront modern man. Humanities Basic Another basic course the Columbia man must deal with is Humanities A. The following are other courses that parents will observe today: Fine Arts 2, Prof. Dustin Rice, 11 a.m.—the theory and practice of sculpturing; Fine Arts 88, Prof. Rice, 2 p.m.—contemporary art; Anthropology 22, Prof. Elliott Skinner, 2 p.m.—race and ethnic relations; Philosophy 84, Prof. George Kline, 2 p.m.—Russian ethical theory; History 10, Prof. James Shenton and Mr. Bernard Wishy, 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. — United States history from 1866 to 1957; Government 6, Mr. Raymond Moore, 2 p.m.—American government; Government 18, Mr. Julian Franklin, 11 a.m. —Democracy and Dictatorships; and Sociology 4, Prof. William Casey, 11 a.m. —basic (societal) mechanisms.Hamilton Hall, where iparenls fcf Columbia students will sit in on College' classes today."

77,Study of Chamberlain Report Proposed by Dean Palfrey Alexander Backs Former Dean On Higher Standards,22 October 1958,"Alexander Backs Former Dean On Higher StandardsBy Stephen C. LernerAssistant Dean John W. Alexander has expressed his warm support for former Dean Lawrence H. Chamberlain's recommendation that Columbia College establish more rigorous standards for admission. He repeated the criticism in Dean Chamberlain's final report of the present foreign language and English requirements, stating that it is ""unforgivable that we should have to give remedial work in the freshman year."" He characterized the language ""A"" and English ""A"" courses as largely fitting this description. The Dean stated that the foreign language requirements for admission to Columbia ""should be what we now require for the A.B. degree."" He conceded that a provision of this sort, in effecteliminating the need for all courses of B2 rank or lower, would not be feasible for a long time. Dean Alexander advised enrollment in Columbia's intensive three-week summer courses as a way of developing language proficiency. Turning to another important part of Dean Chamberlain's report, Dean Alexander approved the idea of a separate budget for general education courses in the College. This, he asserted, would give the College ""more bargaining power in the staffing of the core courses and the College branches of the University departments."" He rejected, however, any idea of establishing a separate College department of General Education, as Dean Chamberlain suggested in his report. Opposes New Department Along the same lines, Assistant Professor of History George T. Matthews, chairman of the CC program, vigorously opposed the creating of a special deparment of General Education with special professors of Contemporary Civilization and Humanities. He said that such departments lead to ""sterility and intellectual isolation,"" in that they ""build walls within the University."" Professor Matthews did feel that a separate budget for core courses would have certain very tangible benefits, however. Chief among these he listed the development of a more stable staff of instructors. Quentin Anderson, Associate Professor of English and head of the Humanities A sequence said that although the proposed budget ""might help to solve certain problems of staffing inherent in the core course program,"" the vertical structure of the University departments ""might make the promotion of a man paid out of the general education budget more difficult."""
78,Hadas States Science Part Of Humanities Declares Desire for Fun Motivates Discoveries,4 March 1959,"Declares Desire for Fun Motivates DiscoveriesMoses Hadas, Jay Professor of Greek, speaking last nig'ht at the fourth OUSIC lecture in the Series ""Man, the World, and the Universe,"" on the topic ""Science and Education,"" declared that pure Science —as opposed to technology—is really a part of the study of the Humanities. All great scientific discoveries, like those in other fields of human endeavor, are motivated by desire for fun, and by curiosity, he continued. Professor Hadas mentioned the work of Joh'arm Huizinga, whose essay ""Homo Ludens"" makes it clear that this is the ease. Professor Hadas stated that his own study cJf Latin was so motivated, and that ""advertisements"" for Latin on the grounds that it will ""build one's vocabulary"" are irrelevant. 'Professor Hadas also voiced dissatisfaction with modern civilization. ""Although the Madison Avenue people are not in a conspiracy"" to establish conformity, ""things -a«e. just as if they were."" Professor Hadas drew a parallel between modern American Civilization and that of ancient Athens.. He spoke of the 5 ? conflicting philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, Isocrates, the Stoics, and the Epicureans, and of their various methods of education. He commented that ""whereever a few Greeks landed"" throughout the Mediterranean region, they set up Greek institution and Greek education. As Isocrates said, Professor ; Hadas continued, the distinction 1 should have been based not on race or national background, but I on speech. ""Logos,"" he continued, the ""world"" or ""reasoned discourse,"" was all-important to Isocrates and the Greeks of his school. The Greeks also established the. use of old or ancient books — ancient even then — as educational instruments, and, in a sense, ""invented"" courses like Columbia's Humanities A, whichProfessor Hadas teaches."
79,Begin Activity On A Journal Of Humanities,8 April 1959,"A group of students have begun to move for the creation of a Journal of the Humanities. In a letter to Spectator, one of the petitioners, Albert Wertheim '61, said that there is a ""definite need for the establishment ! of a Humanities Journal dealing with critical essays in the fields of language, Literature, art. and music."" Wertfieim was the first of several students to place their names on a list favoring the institution of a humanities periodical. Associate Dean Edward J. Malloy, called the idea feasible. He said that there would probably be an organizational meeting within a few days, Weriheinrs letter was prompted by an editorial in yesterday's Spectator which suggested the creation of an arts journal. Students interested in joining the proposed publication should contact either Dean Malloy in 405 Jay or Werbhelm in 503 Hartley."

Palfrey, speaking to Columbia College students Friday at the Deans' Forum, stated that the students in the newly formed undergraduate school of engineering would he allowed to use the facilities of Columbia College, including the new Student Union. 'Dean Palifrey, along wd'th Associate Dean George W. Hilbbitt, Assistant Deans John W. Alexander and Henry S. Coleman, disclosed that this policy will only be temporary and that Engineering School students will foe restricted to the use of the facilities of the Engineering Center when this building is completed. Elaborating on the reduction of liberal arts requirements for the new engineering students, Dean Palfrey announced' that they will only have to take six points of C. C. A., four points of Humanities A, and four points otf C. C. B. j In regard to the proposed Honors Program, Dean Palfrey noted that a faculty smoker will be held this week to ""re-evalu-ate the present major-concen-tration program and the seminar system."" J The seminar system will be studied because of the ""stresses and strains"" it places on a student's schedule. Dean Palfrey gave ijwo reasons for the shortening of Fx&ghmen Week. He asserted raar af two day reduction of the orientation period will not .greatly lessen the adjustment of the commuter to the campus, sinice very little adjustment was possible even with the longer fiveday period. Dean Coleman disclosed that increased financial aid, in the form of one hundred more oncam pus jobs, will be available to undergraduates next September due to the opening of Ferris Booth Hall. He also stated thatthe college will inaugurate a tuition aid-payment plan in conjunction with the Marine Midland Trust Co. next term. Speaking about the desire of some students to eliminate the present cut rules, Dean Alexander noted that these absence regulations are ""mere 'technicalities"" which are not enforced except in the case of a student who ""frivolously cuts."" Dean Palfrey asserted that the change in admissions regulations, Which will increase the amount of advance credit an incoming student can receive and make three years of a foreign language a requirement, will bring better student's to the College.Dean John G.

81,Letter to the Editor Curriculum Revisions,24 April 1959,"Curriculum RevisionsTo the Editor: Dean Palfrey realizes that Columbia College offers its students an undergraduate program that contains far too many required courses; that although the program is outstanding in many ways, it tends to hinder a student from pursuing a subject of major interest during his freshman and sophomore years. The Lower College program as it stands is ideal for a bright young man with a lively interest in the world around him, hut tends to prevent a student who has a particular interest from pursuing it because his program is cluttered with so many general requirements. ""Spec"" pointed out that Health Education Al leaves much to be desired. I would say that the same is true of Physical Education 5-6. Dean Palfrey is killing the patient before he tries to remove the cancer. A student has two points less requirements for one semester and Vi less for two others. This has hardly any effect on his program's flexibility. It simply eliminates from his program of required studies two courses which are poorly worked out at present. , I believe that it would be much more to the point to make revisions in the C.C. and Humanities programs in order to make the students' program more flexible. CCA. and Humanities A are basic courses which should be required of all Columbia College students. I think the ""B"" setup should be changed. These courses give a broad, somewhat superficial survey of music, fine arts, and present day social science. For a student who knows that he wants to major in one of these fields, these courses are not a real indication of what is to come. MBI and FBI are primarily ""appreciation courses,"" marvelous for what they are trying to do, but inappropriate for somebody who already has a general appreciation and who wants to get deeper into the subject. This is not as true of CCB but for someone whose primary interest is in History, Economics, Sociology, Anthropology or Government, the treatment of the subject is not as profound as many of the social science majors are ready for. Most courses in this area do not require CCB as a prerequisite. Each of these departments requires twelve points of work in related areas in order to give the student a broader background for wotk in the field. I believe that considerable flexibility could be introduced into the Columbia College program by eliminating the MBI, FBI. or CCB for students majoring in one of these areas. For me, these courses were ideal. I am not majoring in any of the areas covered by these subjects. In these courses, I gained a real appreciation of the subject 1 was studying. However, I know of students who would have come to Columbia but chose to attend other colleges because they can get much further along in their subject of major interest during their four year stay, and I believe that for many students in Columbia College who are majoring in the subjects for which these courses serve as an introduction, the time spent on them was wasted.

83,UGLIEST BUILDING A New Contest Most Distressing Aspect,6 May 1959,"A New ContestMost Distressing AspectBy NihilThe annual Alpha Phi Omega-sponsored Ugly Man Contest has now gotten under way, and students are gleefully donating their change in a drive to have their favorite professor declared champion. We wonder, though, if APO might not consider running another contest, perhaps even more productive of student interest and contributions. This would be an Ugliest Building on Campus Contest. The idea struck us suddenly yesterday, >as we were strolling around campus to escape briefly the pettiness, insipidity, and nonsense that have dominated the Fourth Floor during the last few days. 'Unfortunately, our faculties must have been over-sharpened by all this ludicrous controversy, for the walk made us realize anew that Columbia's campus is as much characterized by architectural inanity as is its political climate by [arrant stupidity. Imagine the possibilities of this contest. There could be two divisions, one for the completed monstrosities and one for the aesthetic horrors now being constructed or planned. A few minutes of reflection will bring to mind an ample number of candidates for both sections. A great favorite in the first division would undoubtedly be University Hall. This fine old specimen is unique on several counts. It is probably the only combination gymnasium-office buildingpower plant in the world. It is also perhaps the one building that is situated neither atop, at the bottom, or on the side of a hill, but instead manages to curve around one. From any angle—the unbroken, low brick.front, the tunneled side, or the great curved battlement-like back, not to mention the smokestack-scarred top—the old steamboat is a gloriously galling example of how not to design buildings. Butler Library would also gain fa number of votes. This massive igrey edifice, with its touching engraved names of all the men we read in Humanities A and a few that we miss, and its row of totally functionless lonic columns, resembles nothing so much as a huge, ornate cracker box set down north of 114 th (Street. As for its interior, who could not be moved by the consummate ugliness of its worse-than WPIA lobby mural, the fallen arches in its corridor, or the stained glass horror in its College iSrudy. But we suspect that the most popular candidate in this division would be the corrugated steel and concrete excresence jovially called University Hall Annex. This hardy haven for homelessbureaucrats was ibuilt during World War II as a temporary structure. It has already passed its fifteenth birthday, and will, we suspect, grace the campus far longer than will the writer or most readers of this column. Its appearance would need great improvement before even the relatively mild term ""ugly"" could be applied to it. There are, of course, many oth-er examples of sublime ugliness on campus. John Jay and Pupm Halls merit the description because they are disproportionately big. Philosophy, Fayerweather, Mines, and Engineering are too squat to be anything but ugly. As things stand now, then, we have a wondrously ugly campus —so a contest to determine the best embodiment of this spirit should provoke constructive discussion on what to do albout it. Perhaps the best solution would be a merger with Princetonj (Tomorrow's diatribe will deal with the new ugliness that, will soon adorn our fair University.)"
84,Core Courses Fill First Year Program of Studies,17 September 1959,"Columbia College offers the ineoming freshman a series of basic, required subjects which present a tliorou g h introduction to the school's 350-odd advanced courses: These ""basics,"" which total approximately one-third of the 126 points necessary for graduation, provide a foundation for the concentrated studies of the upperciassman. At the core of the liberal arts program are the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities sequences, two-year courses which together give a comprehensive picture of the development of western civilization. ""CC,"" which was organized and developed at Columbia, is an inclusive study of western political, economic, religious, and cultural trends from the middle ages to the present. CCAI-A2 ends with the industrial revolution; CCBI-B2 is concerned primarily with the twentieth century. The actual reading material for the course does not come out of a textbook, but rather out of a source book containing excerpts from the writings of past intellectual andpolitical leaders. For instance, the first-year student studies the Rennaissance by reading portions of Macchiavelli or Erasmus, and he learns of the 19th century through actual contact with the Enclosure Acts, the writings of Darwin and others. The assignments themselves vary, but generally consist of 20 to 30 pages per class hour. Al-A2 meets four times a week; 81-82, three time s. According to the point an hour system generally fol-lowed-at Columbia, CCAI is worth four credits and 81, three. Humanities A is similar in its approach to the Wonld Literature courses offered in many of the high schools. The first semester deals with the classics of the ancient world, beginning with Homer, extending through the works of the Greek playwrights and historians, and ending with portions of the Old Testament. The second half of the course opens with the New Testament and continues through the nineteenth century. Students are required to read approximately one book a week. Humanities FBI and MBl—-Fine Arts and Music—cover the same type of material, in their fields, as Humanities A. The Fine Arts course is a study of trends in painting, sculpture, and architecture as manifested by monuments such as the Parthenon, the Gothic Cathedrals, and the paintings of Rembrandt, while MBI deals with the development of musical styles from the middle ages to the twentieth century. Foreign Languages also list a requirement sequence of two years, but the freshman may escape one or both with a high score on his placement examination. The first year of .work includes five classes a week plus a specified amount of work in a speech laboratory. Grammar is stressed. 81-B2 meets three times a week, with an emphasis on reading and conversation. The college offers eleven languages. As part of the liberal arts program, all undergraduates must select a pair of two-term courses in two of three sciences fields: (A) mathematics; (B) astronomy, chemistry or physics; (C) botany, geology, psychology, zoology. While all of the preceding subjects may be postponed at the discretion of the student and his advisor, every freshman must take English Al-A2 and Physical Education Al-A2. He will also have to complete Phys. Ed. 83-B4 as a sophomore. Both courses are worth onecredit per semester. English classes meet twice a week. Students av: required to write essays on selected prose and poetry readings. Physical Education offers instruction in team and individual sports. The student selects two activities each semester; in order to receive credit for his two years, he must successfully complete one combat sport, one individual sport,and two group sports.~He must also pass a swimming test administered the first or second day of classes."
85,IN LIVING COLOR Things To Come,23 October 1959,"Things To ComeBy NihilThe furor over Charles Van Doren has now diminished, displaced from the Times and Tribune front pages by steel strike developments, and from the tabloids by the deatfh of Errol Flynn. But we are certain that Van Am quad has not seen the last of the hounds of the press and television. We feel that they will probably return during Mr. Van Doren's appearance before the investigating committee. We'd like to take advantage of this momentary lull to offer University officialdom some suggestions, based on experiences of this week, on how to handle the problem in the future. • The Bookstore might do well to send each of the news media a complete set of Humanities A and CC books. In this way, reporters would be able to discuss a few topics intelligently with Mr. Van Doren, even though they still won't know much about John Donne. • On days when reporters are slated to appear, University police might assign a detail to clear away the students and other obstructions in front of Hamilton Hall. This would give the camera an unobstructed view of the professor amidst the ivy. • The Registrar's Office should issue large badges to all members of Mr. Van Doren's classes, perhaps reading, ""Van's My Man."" This would ease the way for reporters seeking human interest stories, showing them at a glance the students most directly associated with their subject. • Alternatively, Mr. Van Doren's classes could all be switched into 212 Hamilton, and reporters invited to attend. Anyone interested might receive General Studies credit, if he promised to write the papers and take the exams without knowing any answers beforehand. • Last week, the policy of making students use the center door only when entering or leaving Hamilton, while reporters were around created a traffic jam that according to reliable sources resulted in four underfed students being trampled. To avoid this, classes on ""reporter days"" could be shifted to South Field. This move might, however, encounter trouble from the Department of Buildings and Grounds, which seems sensitive on this point. • One Freshman Orientation lecture might include a brief talk on television grooming, and on how to answer reporters' questions deftly. • If for some reason publicity is not desired, the tunnels should be opened to allow easy entrance to and exit from the campus. This would also keep Mr. Van Doren. among others, out of the rain."
86,"New Engineering Curriculum Will Emphasize Liberal Arts Students Take CC, Humanities, English; Cooperation With College Stressed",25 November 1959,"Students Take CC, Humanities, English; Cooperation With College StressedBy John D. Hack(Third of a Series)The Collegiate Division of the School of Engineering was created in close cooperation with Columbia College, rather than in competition with it. The new division's program owes much to the College's pioneer general education courses. The liberal arts courses for the engineering students were developed by the College's departments in conjunction with the Engineering School and will be taught by the former's instructors. Dean of the College John G. Palfrey will assist John R. Dunning, Dean of the Engineering School, in administering the freshman and sophomore engineers' programs. The theme of cooperation is emphasized. Associate Dean Wesley J. Hennessy, who is in charge of the collegiate program, says that ""it's been a distinct pleasure"" to work withthe College and adds, ""if this is a<* successful experiment, the College has as much or more credit due than we have."" The program is partially based on the four-year combined plan, Under which student spends two years in the College and two in the Engineering School. Thus, in the freshman and sophomore years it is primarily liberal arts and fundamental science courses which are studied, while the last two years stress engineering work. The liberal arts courses are modeled on the similar College courses, but are adopted to the Engineering School's needs; for example, the Contemporary Civilization course is similar to CC A, bur ewj-'kss -seven points of credit instead of eight and includes greater emphasis on the effects of technology and industry on Western civilization. English Course Stressed In one important liberal arts subject — English — the Engineering School's requirement appears to be more stringent than that of the College. English ElE2, required of all freshman engineers, is a five-point sequence, while the corresponding College course — English Al-A2 — is only two points. The other liberal arts courses required of all students in the engineering program are Humanities El in the third term and Contemporary Civilization E4 in the fourth. These courses, each for four credits, are similar to the College's Humanities A and CC B sequences, except that, as oneterm courses, they cover correspondingly less material. In addition to these require ments, totaling twenty points, each student will also take at least three points of non-technical electives in each term of his last two years. Requirement Waiver Expected Dean Hennessy said that a great many of the freshman engineers would like to use these three points for liberal arts courses far removed from engineering. He expressed the hope that the College would waive some of its requirements for these courses, so that the engineers could take, for example, advanced history and government courses which now have the College's CC sequence as a prerequisite. When these points in the upper years are added to the required lowerclass liberal arts courses, itis found that the engineers take 32 points of liberal arts courses. The school points to the fact that this is actually one point more than the minimum required for a B.A. degree in the College, in support of its contention that it is not turning its back on the need for liberal arts in undergraduate education. Libera] Arts Content High In fact, Dean Dunning, pointing out that the program has a higher liberal arts content than any other four-year engineering program in the country, explains that it was the Engineering School itself that insisted on the heavy liberal arts rsquirements, notably in English. He goes on to point out that most of the men in the school behind the collegiate program have had a liberal arts education. Dean Dunning's own undergraduate degree is a Bachelor of Arts, not a Bachelor of Science. In addition to the liberal arts program, the first two years of the collegiate program will include the basic science, mathematics, and other courses. Since the students in the program will be a specially picked, highly qualified group, the courses are greatly accelerated. The first three terms of mathematics, numbered 19-20-21, are the equivalent of the first four terms of the College sequence. The first term of chemistry is the College's Chem 3. the second, a special course numbered Chem 8, covers a year's work — the second half of general chemistry and qualitative analysis — in one term. The physics sequence is identical with that of the College.The first year also includes a year of graphics. The second year's program varies somewhat, depending on whether the student is planning on chemical engineering or on a branch which emphasizes physics. All sophomores will take mechanics, mathematical statistics, and a course in differential equations. The first two years will thus consist entirely of background material, rather than engineering courses. In his third and fourth years, the student willl specialize in his chosen field of engineering, taking a program similar to that taken in the last two years of the combined programs, except for the required three points per term in non-technical subjects. At the close of the four years, the student will receive the degree of Bachelor of Science. The school feels that it- has answered the fears of those whosee a retreat from liberal arts education. To another criticism — that the setting up of an undergraduate school of engineering forces a choice on students too early—the school has two replies. The first is that the combined programs will still exist for those students who want to go to a liberal arts school first. The new engineering progaam will be only for a special group of students already highly motivated toward the profession. Furthermore, it will be possible to transfer between the College and the collegiate division of the Engineering School. Although this transferring will not be automatic —the student will have to havestrong reasons and present his case to a dean — there will be a procedure established for such cases and the similarity of the lower-class programs will mean(continued on page eight)"
87,Trial by Ordeal,25 March 1960,"The most tortuous moments of the school term come not during the final examination period but during midterm week, that gruelling semi-annual ordeal which Columbia College students have just endured. Such an anomaly is easily explained. There is no co-ordinated planning of the / midterm dates among different departments and courses. Many students are confronted with four or more tests during the same week and often several are scheduled, for a single day. In addition, one must continue to attend and prepare the regular assignments for those courses which have no tests on a given day. The inevitable results of such logjam are chaotic days and sleepless nights. The source of the problem is the College's formalized midterm system, the central fea tare of which is .the so-called midterm date. This is the date by which all instructors must forward ""unofficial"" midterm grades to the registrar's office. This ryiiHtpvm o-rs»rl« «e o ,'Kr ■.- i ; jl out purpose. Entering freshmen are often lacking in the study habits necessary for success in College. Even for sophomores, the midterm grade is a good incentive for regular study. It also enables the Dean's Office to keep tabs on laggards and to give them stiff warnings before the irreversible final D or F is handed down to them. The usefulness of formalized midterms and the midterm date does not extend, however, to Upper College courses. Presumably, those who entered school patently unwilling or unsuited to do college-level work have been weeded out. Presumably, the student is already doing advanced work in a field of his own choice. Presumably, he is sufficiently mature to work without being prodded by a midterm poised over his head. We are not proposing the elimination of all examinations but finals in the Upper College. The removal of the formal midterm would not prevent instructors from giving tests and quizzes at their own discretion. The hodgepodge of midterm week would be elim\inated. Some Upper College courses undoubtedly would still need exams sometime during the term. We are thinking especially of courses which have no term paper, which have no grading opportunities other than the midterm and the final. Other courses could well do entirely without tests during the semester. A prime example is the courses included in the English 61-66 sequence. Most instructors use the ""notebook"" system, which requires the student to write papers on almost every writer in the course. Yet many teachers obstinately insist upon giving superfluous midterms. - Another suggestion would be to co-ordin-ate the midterm dates of Lower College courses which students are likely to betakeing simultaneously. There is no reason why the midterms in CCA and Humanities A, for example, should ever fall on the same day. The adoption of these suggestion would do away with the ordeal of the congested midterm week. The College would thereby rid itself of one of its most unwanted and unnecessary institutions."
88,Engineers in College Courses New Program Poses Problems,4 May 1960,"New Program Poses ProblemsBy Yen T. Tan(This is the first in a series dealing with the problems created by' the direct admissions program of the School of Engineering.)Next September, Columbia College Humanities and English A courses will be open to undergi*aduates in the Engineering School's direct admissions program. The decision to integrate classes with theCollege was prompted by many difficulties which attended the separate liberal arts courses for engineering students. Segregated classes have been one of three basic problems resulting from the direct admission of freshmen to the Engineering School. Inaugurated last September, the direct admissions program was designed to draw more engineering undergraduates to Columbia. Previously, the Engineering School had offered a ""3-2"" arrangement in which the prospective engineer spent the first three years studying either in Columbia College or another liberal arts college participating in this program. Unfortunately, this arrangement attracted few students. Though the new program greatly increased the undergraduate enrollment, it also created a few problems. The first major difficulty involved the scheduling of special classes in Contemporary Civilization, English, and Humanities courses for the engineering stu-dents. This policy was instituted last September with the intent to emphasize English and institute a more streamlined C.C. sequence. Engineering students were given a five point English E sequence as opposed to the two point English A courses offered by the college.A special six point C.C. E sequence was substituted for the regular eight point college C.C. A course. Apprehension among some members of the college faculty that engineers would make poor liberal arts students because ""they have only utilitarian objectives"" was also a factor in the scheduling of special classes. This policy, however, resulted in numerous administrative problems for the departments concerned and created difficult teaching situations for the instructors. The English Department found it extremely difficult to staff and schedule the English E sequence, which was a four point course in the fall semester but only a one point course in the spring, ""I have never seen anything quite so rough from the administrative point of view,"" complained Department Chairman Charles W. Everett. Many mstructors teaching engineering liberal arts courses reported that they encountered a decided lack of enthusiasm in social science subjects. One C.C. instructor claimed that he was forced to work much harder because of a ""mutual reinforcement of indiff-erence"" permeating these classes. Associate Dean of the College John W. Alexander summed up the situation by asserting that ""the lack of intellectual stimulus which can only come from an interplay of ideas from students with differing viewpoints,"" hampered the instructors of the segregated classes. . The decision to integrate freshman english was further prompted by the fact that English A is now a four point sequence, worth only one point less than the special English E. course. Although Humanities Al will be integrated, Humanities A 2 will not be included because of the heavy academic schedules of the undergraduate engineers. Nevertheless, engineers will be allowed to make A 2 with their advisor's approval. On the other hand, the C.C. Department has decided to maintain its present program of segregated classes next semester. Bernard W. Wishy, administrative secretary of the C.C. program, explained that the integration of C.C. wouldnecessitate the addition of parttime instructors to teach college C.C. A classes now directed by fulltime faculty members. At present part-time instructors are asked to teach only the special C.C. E sequence. Dean Alexander, however, expressed the opinion that the C.C. department likes to ""experiment"" with new arrangements like the three point C.C E sequence. He predicted, nevertheless, that the engineering C.C. program will be integrated in the future. TOMORROW: The tax on College facilities.Dean of the School of Engineering John R. Dunning."
89,Integration,4 May 1960,"With the announcement that freshman English and Humanities Al classes in the new undergraduate division of the School of Engineering will be integrated with those of the College, the year-old program has taken an important step toward preserving the liberal arts ""core"" content in its curriculum. The School of Engineering has recognized that an emasculated liberal arts sequence for its undergraduates would imperil the success of its entire program. Similarly, it is to the advantage of undergraduate engineers not to be segregated from students with divergent interests and different professional plans. The School feels that the freshman work load is too heavy to bear the strain of Humanities A 2. The engineers will also continue to take a separate three-term C.C. sequence, ostensibly because it would be difficult to staff an integrated program without the use of part-time faculty. It is unfortunate that further steps toward integration have not been taken. The . School of Engineering has already ruled out Humanities B as a requirement; it would be sad if as valuable a course as Humanities A 2 should also be abridged or discarded. The same is true of Contemporary Civilization. Besides its own version of C.C. A, the School now offers a one-term condensation of C.C. B. As long as the eventual disposition of Columbia College's C.C. B course remains in doubt, it would be wise for the School of Engineering to shun participation. But C.C. A should be integrated immediately, with every effort exerted to staff it with full-time faculty members. Both Humanities A 2 and C.C. A are too central a part of a full education to be watered clown for the sake of more exhaustive specialization on the part of the engineers."

91,"Basic Courses Fill Freshman Program CC, Humanities, English Lay Foundation For Advanced Study in Upper College",19 September 1960,"CC, Humanities, English Lay Foundation For Advanced Study in Upper CollegeColumbia College offers the in-' ■coming freshman a series of basic, required subjects which present a thorough introduction to the .school's 350-odd advanced courses. These ""basics,"" which total approximately one-third of the 126 points necessary for graduation, -provide a foundation for the concentrated studies of the upper classman. At the core of the liberal arts program are the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities sequences, two-year courses which together give a comprehensive pieture of the development of Western civilization. ""CC,"" which was organized and developed at Columbia, is an inclusive study of western political, economic, religious, and cultural trends from the middle ages to the present. CCAI-A2 focuses -primarily on pre-twentieth century thought. CCBI-B2 is con-cerned primarily with the twentieth century. The actual reading material for the cclirse does not come out of a textbook, but rather out of a source book containing excerpts from the writings of past intellectual- and political leaders. For example, the first-year student studies the Rennaisance by reading portions of Macchiavelli or Erasmus, and he learns of the 19th century through actual contact with the Enclosure Acts, the writings of Darwin and others. The assignments themselves, vary, but generally consist of 20 to 30 pages per class hour. Al-A2 meets four times a week; 81-82, three hours. According to the point an hour system generally followed at Columbia, CCA is worth four credits and CCB, three. Humanities A is similar in itsapproach to the World Literature courses offered in many of the high schools. The first semester deals with the classics of the ancient world, beginning with Homer, extending through the works of the Greek playwrights and historians, and ending with portions of the Old Testament. The second half of the course opens with the New Testament, and continues through the nineteenth century. Students are required to read approximately one book a week.

The Fine Arts course is a study of trends in painting, sculpture, and architecture as manifested by monuments such as the Parthenon, the Gothic Cathedrals, and the paintings of Rembrandt, while MBI deals with the development of musical styles from the middle ages to the twentieth century. Foreign languages also list a requirement sequence of two years, but the freshman may escape one or both with a high score on his placement examination.

The College offers eleven languages. i As part of the liberal arts program, all undergraduates must select a pair of two-term courses in two or three fields of science: (A) mathematics; i(B) astronomy, chemistry or physics; (iC) botany, geology, psychology, zoology. While all of the preceding subjects may be postponed at the discretion of the student and his adviser, every freshman must take English Al-A2 and Physical Education Al-A2. He will also have to complete Phys. Ed. 83-B4 as a sophomore. Formerly both courses were worth one credit semester but this year, English A 4ias been raised to two points. English classes meet twice a week. Students are required to write essays on selected prose and poetry readings. Physical education offers instruction in team and individual sports. The student selects two activities each semester; in order to receive credit for his two years, he must successfully complete one combatative sport, one individual sport, and two group sports.

92,WIN PRIZES A Matter of Mutter,9 December 1960,"A Matter of MutterBy Robert E. PollackYou're walking from Hamilton to Havemeyer some Wednesday morning at 11:00. As you pass through the Class of 1848 gate, you happen to look up and see someone approaching from College Walk: your roommate's former roommate, your former roommate's roomate — someone you know by sight only, and have never spoken to. What do you do? You look down at the bricks of the walk or right at the Ivy on the walls of Hamilton until, just at the right instant, you look up, meet his (or her) eyes, nod, smile, mutter a ""Hiya"" so soft that only you can hear it, refocus your eyes on the New Jersey coast seen down 116 th street, and go back io thinking about women. The other person does the same. Everyone knows all this. But did you ever consider the problem of precisely when to look up and meet eyes, and when to breakaway? If either operation is premature, the other person is forced to squint and think of you for a longer time than is comfortable to him, or to twist his neck around awkwardly in order not to appear to cut off your greeting in mid-mutter. If the look comes too late, both persons are liable to walk on asking themselves, ""Now who the heck was that?"" It has been found, after careful scientific study, that the proper moment for pseudo-greeting (as it is termed) comes precisely ten steps after that moment when you feel the first sensation of uneasiness at knowing that: • Under no circumstances will you actually say hello, • Under no circumstances will the other person care to say hello to you, and, • You owe him a dime, or a cigarette. Here are a couple of problemsfor you to woik out at home: 1) You are a junior in the College. You are walking from Butler to the subway kiosk along College Walk when you see your former Humanities A instructor, an assistant professor of English, walking towards you. He gave you an A-. What is the proper mutter distance between you— (a). 20 feet, (b). 10 feet, (c). 18 inches? What is the proper distance if he gave you a C+ and laughed when he handed back your term paper? 2) You are an assistant professor of English. You are worried about the publication of your latest study of the role of earwax in the later poetry of John Donne. You have 75 English A themes to mark by 3:00; you have absolutely no interest in the topic which the department asked you to assign. In the distance, you •see the doors of Butler spewing forth undergraduates. You recognize among them one whose term paper the previous year was remarkably vapid, but nevertheless not incorrect.What is the proper mutterdistance here. What is it if the student is walking with a young woman, talking incoherently at the top of his voice? (Send your answers to 934 Hartley Hall. Prizes will be awarded for the best entries.)"

94,"To Revitalize English Hieatt Seeks Incorporation Of English A, Humanities A",17 February 1961,"Hieatt Seeks Incorporation Of English A, Humanities ABy Andrew B. Schultz(Last of Three Articles)English A and Humanities A may be combined into a single, required course. The proposal, still in the visionary stage, would require major revisions in the College's curriculum. A. Kent Hieatt, director of English A, believes that ""coordination of the reading in Humanities with the writing in English"" would increase the value of the present course content. Underlying Professor Hieatt'ssuggestion is the dissatisfaction of instructors with the limited scope of English A. Two chief shortcomings are commonly cited: insufficient student interest because of infrequent meetings (twice a week) and small course credit (two points per semester); and the low number of compositions required of each student. The suggested change calls for study of fewer works of literature, in greater depth. For each reading, students would discuss the book, a feature of the present Humanities A course, but would also be asked to write frequent analyses of the works discussed. ""The issues in Humanities readings are good topics for English,"" Professor Hieatt notes. Syllabus Charges Seen If the proposed setup is adopted, Humanities A would undergo a significant change in its syllabus. Emphasis on classics translated from foreign languages would shift to outstanding pieces of English Literature. For example, analysis of Virgil's Aeneid is somewhat hampered by the translation, which distorts the effect of the original Latin poetry. The change, if adopted, would not be the first for a required English course at Columbia. Originally started over forty yearsago as a three-point course, a year of required English was devoted in part to discussion, both oral and written, of Greek plays and Norse sagas, stressing literary structure. In 1937, a faculty study determined that a specific course in world literature would be a more appropriate vehicle for this study. The now-famed Humanities A was instituted that year as a four point course. English, weakened by loss of much of its curriculum, was dropped in the early 1940's and was replaced by a course known as English C, which amounted to little more than an informal tutoring program for students especialy weak in grammar and composition. When the concept proved unsuccessful, English A was instituted. Generally stressing writing, therequired course offered one point for the full year. When students protested the meager credit they received despite frequent writing assignments, the English department added an additional credit. Since September, students -have received two points for each semester. Professor Hieatt emphasizes that fusion of Humanities- A and English A is still several years from fruition. He feels the proposed changes would fulfill the purposes of English A ""startlingly better"" than the- •course re~ quired now. It seems clear that a thorough, reevaluation of English A is needed. Perhaps it is noteworthy that every teacher contacted in the English department expressed the view that the present, course .is unsatisfactory."
95,Retreat,23 February 1961,"Part of our hesitancy to endorse the recent suspension of C.C. B derives from a fear that the now uncertain future of the second-year social science requirement might develop along departmental, rather than interdisciplinary lines. Thus, a vital and stimulating interchange of related concepts could conceivably give way—as much by accident as by design—to isolated introductory disciplines which, even collectively, fail to compare in scope to the present program. . . For this reason, we view with grave misgivings Prof. A. Kent Hieatt's recent suggestion that Humanities A and English A be integrated. Although the Humanities selections might enrich the freshman English curriculum, the disadvantages of Professor Hieatt's proposal both to Humanities A and to the entire general education sequence far outweigh its merits. Since Humanities A took its place alongside C.C. A and Bin 1937, Columbia's core program has been noted for its singularly exciting treatment of major trends in literature and the social sciences. The entire development of Western civilization becomes particularly clear and vivid for the student who is reading Dante, Rabelais, and Goethe while his C.C. instructor is discussing the close of the Middle Ages, the humanist renaissance, and the romantic period. A union of Humanities A and English A would necessarily result in a shift in the balance between translations of foreign 'works and great pieces of English literature. As Professor Hieatt himself notes, translations depart too often from the original writings for the precise purposes of practice in composition. If this were extended to its logical conclusion, in place of the broad outlook in Humanities A, the freshman would receive instead what amounts to an introduction to English literature. Such a change would not only diminish the relevance of the subject matter to C.C., but would fail to impart to the beginner either a sufficient appreciation of continental works, or an understanding of the impact of European authors upon their English contemporaries. Moreover, since a combined course including the study of English composition must necessarily be taught by English instructors alone, the new requirement would have to sacrifice the interdepartmental representation of men who are particularly anxious and qualified to take part in the present program. A professor from Philosophy or Classics adds the experience of his own specialty to the already rich material of Humanities A. The loss of these teachers would still further reduce a comprehensive general survey to the narrow scope of the departmental approach. We must not ignore the advantages, which Professor Hieatt so aptly noted, of co-ordi-nating Humanities readings with the work of composition in English A. C.C. source material has been used occasionally in recent years, but without co-ordination, and—because of the nature of the selections—without much success. The works in Humanities, as whole rather than abridged readings, would be more suited, especially with some co-ordination of the calendars of the two courses. Before Humanities was adopted as a requirement in 1937, its sponsors had to wage a vigorous battle against opponents who maintained that a general treatment of the masterpieces of world literature would necessarily be lacking in depth and scholarly rigor. Since that time, the success of the general education program has vindicated the proponents of an interdisciplinary approach. Professor Hieatt's suggestion, however con-structive, would, if enacted, signify a retreat to the departmental provincialism of the past, We must guard against this provincialism in our adjustment of the second-year social science requirement. We must likewise guard against it in any other domain of the liberal arts."
96,Letters to the Editor,1 March 1961,"To ihe Editor: It seems to me that in a recent editorial Spectator might well have condemned more sharply than it did the proposal which it ascribed to me there and in a preceding news-story. As I understand it, I am said to advocate a merger of Humanities A and of English A, and a modification of Humanities A in the direction of a standard one-year survey of English literature. Perhaps courtesy kept you from going further than you did in discussing the position as described; I think you should have expressed much more serious doubts than I find in your editorial. As matters stand, however, the position as described has only adventitious connections with what I myself think and say on the subject. I do not advocate a merger of the two courses; I think it might be a fruitful experiment to coordinate ihe writing of themes in English A with readings in Humanities A. But I know that ihe experiment would be faced with almost insuperable mechanical difficulties. I do not think thai the character of the Humanities A course should be changed. It is the most exciting course thai I have ever iaughi, and I expect to teach ii again, as soon as I can, in approximately its present form. Even the addition of iwo or ihree new readings which could be discussed in English A according to ihe canons of strictly modern expository style would be the subject of serious heari-searchings. A. Kent Hieait Associate Professor of English February 28, 1961 (Note: Our editorial was an attack not on Professor Hieatt but on the idea of integrating the two courses, ivhich we felt might occur if Professor Hieatt's suggestion ""ivere extended to its logical conclusion."" Professor Hieatt has specifically suggested that co-ordination would require the replacement of two or three translated works with writings in English. Such logic, we fear, could eventually lead to a change in the whole character of the Humanities course—ed.) To the Editor: The drawn by Mr. Joseph Alpher in his letter of February 24, 1961, are based on sweeping generalizations, patently false stereotypes, and a callous disregard for facts. I should like to know what contact Mr. Alpher has had with fraternities to enable him to be so dogmatic about them. His letter shows that he is quite removed from reality. A fraternity is a valuable source of experience in self-governmeni and democracy. It encourages men from the most diverse regional, cultural, and financial backgrounds io live togeiher in a community of mutual interdependence and co-opera-tion. The ""impotence"" which Mr. Alpher says characterizes fraternity life at Columbia is a ficiion. In my ov/n house over 75% of ihe brothers are on varsiiy squads. The figures are similar in many of the houses at Columbia. The fraternities have provided some of the most capable and active people in all areas of King's Crown activities. Leaders of student government at Columbia are usually fraternity men. Far from being a stifling conformist influence, a fraternity provides ihe catalyst to maiuriiy which the impersonal atmosphere of the classroom and dormitory cannot. Mr. Alpher's last point, that the desire of each fraternity to preserve its individual character by having separate facilities in a proposed miulti-fra-ternity dormitory sounds like a segregationist plea, is an absurd example of semantic juggling. Every fraternity has the right to be proud of its long years of tradition and custom. A fraternity would soon lose its cohesiveness and spirit if it could not have private facilities. Mr. Alpher with his innuendo of segregation clouds the issue. He is trampling on the right of a fraternity brother to choose his own friends and his own place of association.

100,TO DR. MARCUS An Open Letter From Michael Selkin,5 June 1961,"An Open LetterFrom Michael SelkinDear Professor Marcus: | I probably have to remind you that I was in your Humanities A 2 section three years ago this past semester, for in that class, I am afraid, I distinguished myself by nothing other than my foolishness on a few occasions, and you seem the sort who might well charitably confine such memories to oblivion. It is about one of these expressions of that foolishness, one about which I have often been reminded in the past three-years-and-then-some, that I, a senior who cannot yet say for certain whether he shall be graduated at the ceremonies this issue of Spectator is to accompany, feel I must recall here, to let you know how much your teaching has affected my consciousness, and because the story is, I have decided, the most significant farewell column I can write for Spectator. I do not think ii will be giving away too much of your pedagogic iechnique to remind you that during that semester you characteristically began discussions of new authors with semi-rhetorical questions, questions to which you DID seem to expect answers, but to which there could usually be only one reply. It is a fine technique and for all I know you still use it in some form or other; I hope you are not annoyed if, should I ever teach, I borrow it from you. On the day in question, the new author was Saint Augustine; the work, his ""Confession."" You question was—forgive me if the words are not precisely yours—this: ""Does anyone here believe that he always completely understands the causes of his own actions."" One hand, mine, flapped lazily up from its anchor in the last row, next to the window. ""Aha,"" think I, ""the others aren't even paying enough attention to poor Mr. Marcus to give him the rhetorical answer he needs to go on. I have distinguished myself."" and then:""this is suspicious, he is glaring, is it possible that I heard wrong, that he really said 'Does anyone here not believe . . .'?"" ""Mr. Selkin,"" you queried, ""did you understand the question?"" Tremulous reply: ""I thought you asked if we always understand the reasons for our own actions."" ""And you do?"" you asked. Again self confident: ""Of course!"" You looked at me for a time, saying nothing. Then, before continuing the lecture, one final comment: ""You're a very lucky man, Mr. Selkin."" As I noted above, I do not yet know whether or not I shall be graduated with my class. Since that day you congratulated me on my ignorant felicity, I have changed my politics, my major, my ethics, my ambitions, and my way of life. I have most important of all learned to love, have lost in love, am lost in this loss. I first realize that I had been wrong when I so surely answered you that day and then, more importantly, that there would probably, certainly, never come a day in my life when I could give that answer in complete truth. I learn this again every so often, and always think of that day in your classroom. I suppose that, no matter when I end my disappointing career here, I will always keep remembering that incident. I have focused my thoughts on it for about two years now; it was both an important part of my continuing education and a constant warning against presumption. It has served me in better stead than almost any single thing at Columbia. It is one of the things that give truth to the old cliche, about education being more than knowledge. Thank you for listening to me now. Thank you very much for that incident. Thank you very much especially for your contempt. Michael Selkin '61 May 26, 1961"
101,1965 Offered New Course Requirements,18 September 1961,"By Dov M. GrunschlagThe vaunted Columbia College program of core requirements takes on a new look this semester, and the Class of '65 is sure to be faced with still further changes before its graduation. This year's freshmen are beneficiaries of the administration's response to mounting dissatisfaction with the science requirement. The old system, under which students were required to take two full years in subjects from three categories, has been greatly liberalized. Students are now able to choose any combination of corses, totaling two years, from the following subjects: mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, physics, botany, geology. psychology, and zoology. While the change has answered the cry for greater flexibility in the science requirement, it has left unsatisfied the demand for a new concept in the requirement, one that would present science inthe context of contemporary civilization rather than in a purely technical way. There is disagreement within the science department over which approach to the requirement is most useful to the liberal arts student. The concern for a valuable presentation of contemporary civilization in a liberal arts program is reflected also in a muchpublicized change in the social science requirement. Although the freshman course in contemporary civilization has been left intact, dealing mainly with pretwentieth century thoughts on politics, economics, religion, and culture, the sophomore offering has been suspended as a requirement and a wide choice of alternatives in various departments has been instituted for a three-year experimental period. Known as CC 82, the sophomore offering was concerned primarily with twentieth century problems of economic and social organization. It was held in lowesteem by the various social science departments from which it recruited its faculty. The course was attacked as a superficial and vain attempt to cover a field too broad to be taught by one instructor. As a result, the morale of the teaching staff was low and its standai-d, students often complained, was poor. The new CC B format, featuring one- and two-semester introductory courses in separate disciplines, with new offerings especially designed for the requirement, is already a subject of controversy. Administered by Associate Professor of History Robert K. Webb, it is expected by many educators to produce a deeper understanding by students of contemporary civilization problems. But the new system is viewed with skepticism by others, who fear that the ideal of general education has hec-h compromised in favor of greater specialization, ' There are also those who welcome such a development. The freshman CC course, al-though given a vote of confidence by the committee which suspended CC B, is not immune to changes. ""The good secondary schools probably will experiment more frequently and more sue-cessfully than ever before with general education programs resembling CC A,"" the committee report states. Should this occur, the course will be recast to pre-serve the ""elements of intellectual challenge and novelty."" Another change still under consideration is the extension of the foreign language requirement, now two years, with freshmen being placed according to ability demonstrated in examinations given during Freshman Week. The language sequence is thought to lag behind the rapid progress of high schools in this field. It is also considered inadequate in meeting the modern student's language needs. The two years Humanities requirement — the first a study of world literature, the fine arts and music — -Remains a constant 0 f the reThe jwj&cidi literajjjfe survey (Humjafiities Al■£s), taugh bviatstructors from the English 'Philosophy, Religion andjs-anguages departments, starts 'with Greek masterworks and goes up through nineteenth century classics. The half - year courses in music and fine arts, Humanities MBI and FBI, are introductory surveys. The English Department, while participating in the Humanities A program, also administers the one-year English requirement forfreshmen. This course places emphasis on clear, precise use of the language. Despite speculation that the English and Humanities A requirements might be integrated, the two remain separate, at least for the present. Rounding out the program of requirements is the two-year physical education course, offering diversified combative, individual and group sports.Professor Webb"
102,CU Pioneers in Oriental Studies Programs East Asia Now Established In General Education Plan,20 November 1961,"East Asia Now Established In General Education PlanBy Dov M. GrunschlagOriental Studies at Columbia College is no longer an exotic subject. After ten years of growth, the program is now firmly entrenched in whatever is left of general education at the College. Its administrators, headed by William Theodore de Bary, are the ambitious leaders for similar programs throughout the country. Convinced of the increasing need for understanding East Asian culture and politics, Professor de Bary and his associates have succeeded in making - their Oriental Civilizations sequence a part of the revised CC B program. But the measure of their success is seen still more in the influence of the Columbia program on oriental studies in other colleges. Working with almost missionary zeal to bring the Far East closer to America, the Morningside professors are preparing texts and translations, and conducting an internship program for instructors from other colleges. They have also held conferences on how to plan and teach oriental studies courses. In all of these ventures, the University Committee on Oriental Studies emphasizes that Columbia College, as distinct from Columbia University, is the focus of attention. ""It may surprise many people to know that there are teachers in this university who care about giving the Collegeits own identity,"" Professor de Bary said. An example of this emphasis on the role of the College in the oriental program is the following notation on the cover of several source translations: ""Prepared for the Columbia College Program of translations from the Oriental Classics."" Behind such careful distinction between the graduate and undergraduate levels is the strong feeling of the Columbia department that oriental studies should take their place beside western civilization courses in the general education of college students. Columbia students seem convinced of this. Approximately 240 of them are now enrolled in the Oriental Humanities and Civilizations courses, representing a fifty per cent increase over last year. Almost eighty are taking Oriental Studies for CC B credit. Observing the program • are four ""teaching fellows,"" members of faculties of other colleges who attend classes and discuss technical and substantive problems in weekly luncheon and evening seminars. Supported by funds from the five-year, $185,000 Carnegie Corporation grant (now in its fourth year), the fellowship program has already proven its worth, both here and at other colleges. The first three Fellows brought to the University in 1958 have remained on the staff and are now teaching in the Oriental Studiesprogram. They are Ainslie T. Embree, Maan Z. Madina, and John T. Meskill. Others return to their schools to build oriental studies programs. For example, Robert Olson, whose field is Indian religion, is now in his second year in the program. A Junior Fellow receiving $2500 a year, Mr. Olson will be leaving next year to introduce oriental studies in a new college, Florida Presbyterian. Two Senior Fellows, with considerable teaching experience, are taking part in the program this year. Pichon P. Y. Loh, associate professor of history at Anderson College, Indiana, and Harold L. Sims, associate professor of English at Whitman College, Washington, are receiving stipends which .correspond to their salaries at home with adjustments to the New York cost of living. Last year's Senior Fellows are now, bringing oriental studies toundergraduates at Union, Vassal' and Heidelberg Colleges. Where is the Oriental Studies program headed? In strictly physical terms, it is about to move into Kent Hall, where a large reading room andstack area will be set aside for the 205,000 Chinese and Japanese Volumes that now occupy two floors in Low Library. In educational terms it appears that the program will build on the now-secure basis of Oriental Studies here. The department is anxious to offer its majors a wide variety of senior seminars in the history, language, and thought of the Far East. As more lowerclassmen take the introductory Oriental .Studies courses, the need for elaboration in the upper college increases. Along similar lines, the University hopes to create interdepartmental graduate programs in Oriental Humanities — a field in which the East Asian Institute does not offer sufficient variety. These plans exemplify the boldness and assurance with which the Columbia Oriental Studies program has achieved its rapid growth in the College and University.PIONEERS: Professors William Theodore de Barv (1.) and C. Mariin Wilbur, who have been instrumental in Columbia's Oriental Studies Program."

108,The Snow-Leavis Controversy: Two Cultures,30 March 1962,"By Richard Freedman/// Dubious Battle on the Plains of Cambridge: The Great Leaiis-Suoic Debate.The bitter attack launched upon C. P. Snow by F. R. Leavis as that irascible critic's valedictory lecture at Cambridge has caused considerable stir on both sides of the Atlantic. Even the New York Times was sufficiently jolted from its customary torpor concerning matters of the mind to devote some space— ordinarily reserved for stirring tales about the cultural doings in Nyack and Mamaroneck — to recounting the alarums and excursions of the battle. But the Times, normally scrupulous about providing its readers with sufficient background material to place a story in its proper context, has in this instance failed to give the English cultural life conducive to the acrimonious debate now raging between a respected nov-elist and an equally respected critic. This aspect is the favorite English indoor sport of prolonged and acid controversy over more or less intellectual subjects, conducted in the correspondence columns of the higher-toned weekly newspapers. Professor Leavis is one of the most expert and prolific participants in this heady sport. Only a few months ago he and his followers were embroiled in savage controversy with Philip Toynbee and his myrmidons in the august pages of The Observer. The current debate is unusual in only two respects: first, it began not with a letter or review, but as a lecture, allegedly intended for few, select ears, and only subsequently printed in The [English] Spectator. Second, one of the participants, C. P. Snow, has not as yet deigned to reply publicly, pre-ferring to let such distinguished seconds as Dame Edith Sitwell and Lord Boothby represent him in what promises to be the first of many rounds. A third defender, William Ger-hardi, has, with some justice, dubbed Dr. Leavis ""the Himmler of literature."" Certainly the tone of Leavis' article is vicious in the extreme, and is stylistically rather close to Mein Kampf. Starting with a traditional disclaimer of malicious intent— ""don't, I beg, suppose that I am enjoying a slaughterhouse fieldday"" — Leavis, presumably with some pains, calls Snow ""portentously ignorant . . . intellectually as undistinguished as it is possible to be . . . utterly without a glimmer of what creative literature is, or why it matters."" Characteristic of Leavis' method of attacking Snow's fiction is the following: ""As a novelist he doesn't exist, he doesn't begin to exist.. He can't be said to know what a novel is. The nonentity is apparent on every page of his fictions — consistently manifested, whatever aspect of anovel one looks for. I am trying to remember where I heard (can I have dreamed it?) that they are composed for him by an electronic brain called Charlie, into which the instructions are fed in the form of the chapter headings. However that may be, he—or the brain (if that's the explanation) — can't do any of the things the power to do which makes a novelist."" The above passage is typical of the entire essay, combining as it does gratuitous, irresponsible and boorish personal attack, elephantine archness (the aside, ""can I have dreamed it?""), and ineffably turgid syntax (the last sentence) unjustified by the weak excuse that it was orig-inally meant to be read aloud. The text was printed on March 9 at Leavis' request, and presumably with his proof-reading, in response to several incomplete and garbled newspaper reports of the Feb. 28 lecture. In all fairness, a good deal of the animus of Leavis' attack is directed not at Snow the novelist but at a worthier target: Snow the pundit and self-pro-claimed exemplar of the ""two cultures."" Leavis sees his adversary as a man not particularly well versed in either science or art who has the temerity to tell the rest of us that we ought to be ashamed of our lack of scientific knowledge, and who implicity holds himself up as a unique example of a brain sufficiently mighty to bridge successfully the gap between thesedissimilar disciplines. Leavis is justifiably enraged at the sacrosanct aura now surrounding Snow's 1959 Rede Lecture, The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution. Here Leavis is on safer ground than when he is attacking Snow's fiction. This is paradoxical, because Leavis' reputation stems primarily from his book, The Great Tradition, which' is one of the few serious discussions of the English Novel, and which has had a profound effect on the reading and teaching of fiction ever since its publication. Idiosyncratic as that book is — of the three upholders of the Great Tradition in English Fiction to whom the most space is devoted, George Eliot, Henry James and Joseph Conrad, only one was English — it showed far greater critical powers than are evident in Leavis' attack on Snow's novels. Of these he is content merely to cite The Affair, as a ""feeble exercise,"" which it may well be, but only in comparison to its highly successful predecessor, The Masters. For the rest, Leavis constantly resorts to a circular, ad hominem argument: the novels are stupid because Snow is stupid. Leavis' principle objections to Snow are that he is a snobbish social climber, obsessed with ""the Corridors of Power,"" and that he is both defaming the Cambridge faculty with his barely fictionalized portrayals and seeking to overthrow the primacy of the humanities in the Cambridge curriculum by stressing that science offers far greater intellectual discipline. Leavis has been deeply concerned with the century-old problem of arts vs. science in the university curriculum at least since 1945, when he published Education and the University, in which he emphatically states his conviction that English Literature can and should be a central discipline for university students. Like so many embattled humanists, he feels threatened by the awesome power of science in the twentieth century. In C. P. Snow he has found a scapegoat for all the ills brought about directly or indirectly by science since the Industrial Revolution. Leavis is entirely correct in debunking The Two Cultures as a serious attempt at reconciliation. Its reverent selection as the text for Freshman Indoctrination at Columbia two years ago upholds Leavis' mocking complaint about the odor of sanctity the book has attained. For all its brevity it abounds in both minor and major fallacies. An example of the former is the bland statement that ""there is a moral component right in the grain of science itself, and almost all scientists form their own judgments of the moral life."" Indeed they do. The scientists <tf the Third Reich felt themselves entirely morally justified in their infamous ""experiments"" and, according to William L. Shirer, not one member of the respectable medical profession in Germany saw fit to question the sadistic, unproductive rites going on in the fair name of science at Dachau and Buehenwald. If it is argued that doctors are not truly scientists, surely the magic appellation would fit a Werner von Braun, whose inherent ""moral component"" shaped a career best describedby Mort Sahl as ""I Aim for the Stars. . . . But Sometimes I Hit London."" No field of human endeavor can boast a built-in moral component. Individual humans behave more or less morally in specific situations, and a scientist should be the first to realize this. A more basic flaw in The Two Cultures is a fallacy in the very structure of Snow's argument. His major premise is that humanists know and care nothing about science and that scientists, while they know something of the humanities, are generally indifferent to them. Most scientists can tell you something about Shakespeare, but how many humanists can discourse on Rutherford, a man Snow sees as roughly the scientific equivalent of Shakespeare. This is generally quite true, although far from being a condemnation of the humanists it is an affirmation of the profound necessity the human spirit feels for the arts. Snow's attitude, however, is that of a schoolmarm sharply rapping the humanists' knuckles. The second premise is that, like it or not, we are all subject to the results of the scientific- — technological revolution of the twentieth century. Not to put too fine a point on it, we may all be blown up today. No disputing this. It is the conclusion these two premises lead Snow to that is fallacious. Because laymen are ignorant of science, and because their lives are forfeit to it, they had better learn something rjbout it pretty quickly. You in the fourth row: what is the Second Law of Thermodynamics? Look it up! Your life depends on knowing it! The falsehood here is that we are not — scientists and humanists alike ■ — the pawns of science. We are the pawns of pow-er-hungry elites on both side of the Iron Curtain; elites composed of men who, like Snow himself, enjoy being ""in"" on the Corridors of Power. These men are historically uninterested in science past the point at which it can help further their designs. They are, of course, totally oblivious to art. Now no matter how carefully the scientists and the humanists study each other's disciplines; no matter how sympathetic they are to each other's problems, neither group is in control of our lives. Instead, scientists and artists, knowledgeable and ignorant, are all equally subject to the whims of politicians essentially devoid of both scientific and artistic curiosity. To the politician it matters not whether he rattles sabers or hydrogen bombs. He— not the ivory tower humanistis the proper target of Snow's attack; he is the one who must be educated, not in science or in art, but in basic decency and morality, and he, like the Yahoo, is essentially ineducable. This is the point that Snow misses in his Two Cultures, and it is the point which Leavis perceives in his critique, but the perception is obscured by the turgidity of his prose and is nullified by his personal animosity. Leavis, however, correctly sees Snow as unimportant in himself, but vastly important as a symptom of a general cultural retreat. His books have been immensely popular with a middlebrow audience tired of"

110,Changes Announced Von Gronicka Leaving CU; Gilliam to Join Greek Dept.,19 April 1962,"Von Gronicka Leaving CU; Gilliam to Join Greek Dept.By Andrew B. SchultzBy Jonathan SteinJ. Frank Gilliam, a noted papyrologist now at the University of Oregon, will join the Columbia factulty next year as a full professor of Greek and Latin. Professor Gilliam will fill the position formerly held by the late John Day. He will teach graduate courses on Greek papyri, literature of the Roman republic, and an offering on the works of Horace. The department also announced the promotions of Charles H. Kahn to associate professor and Daniel E. Gershenson to assistant professor. Associate Professor John F. C. Richards will retire in June, 1963 after a sabbatical next year. Anthon Professor of Latin Language and Literature Gilbert Highet will instruct courses on Demosthenes, Lucian, and Vergil. Jay Professor of Greek Moses Hadas will teach Humanities A,advanced Latin prose composition, and single semester offerings on classical epic and classical drama. Associate Professor Howard N. Porter's Iliad course will be given in the fall term by Professor Kahn. Professor Porter will return after a semester's leave to teach the spring term. The department will experiment next year with the first year Greek and Latin courses. Additional sections of the A-l courses will be added to the curriculum in the spring. Robert Maguire, now an instructor at Dartmouth College, will become an assistant professor in the Columbia Russian department next year. He will teach a section of the introductory language course; a spring term offering on Tolstoy and Dostoevsky; a fall semester study of a Russian novelist, probably Turgenev; and a graduate course on Soviet Russian literature given in the spring. It is expected that two faculty members will be promoted. Instructor Richard A. Gregg will be named an assistant professor and a scholar in Graduate Faculties will be granted an associate professorship.Professor of German Andre von Gronicka has accepted a position as chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's German department. Professor von Gronicka has taught at Columbia for eighteen years and most recently instructed the College course on Thomas Mann. Associate Professor of German, Walter H. Sokel, will be going on leave next term and will probably also take the spring semester off. He will be working on a book about Kafka and an anthology of German expressionist plays. Coming to the department as an associate professor will be Theodore Ziolkowski, who has taught at Yale University. He will teach courses in the graduate school and in the College. Villard Professor of Germanic Philology, Carl F. Bayerschmidt, will spend next year on leaveunder a Fulbright Fellowship and will teach for part of the time in Hamburg. There will be an experimental joint course offering in the Italian department next year similar to those planned for the history department. The course on Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio (3639x-3640y) will be listed in the General Studies catalogue ?|ad will be taught by a G.S. instructor. According to Assistant Professor Luciano Rebay the recent merger of the department with the Barnard Italian department ""has been for us a great boon."" For the first time in the department's history there were four sections of the first year Italian course. Professor Rebay will be on leave next year on a Chamberlain Fellowship. John C. Nelson, an assitant pro-fessor at Harvard will replace Professor Rebay. He has accepted a tenure post here and will teach the elementary and third year Italian courses. The chairman of the Barnard Italian department, Associate Professor Maristella de Panizza Lorch, will be going to Berkeley for the spring semester as avisiting professor. Also on leave at Barnard will be Assistant Professor Elizabeth Czoniczer. Professor Rebay will have two books published soon. They are ""Invitation to Italian Poetry"" and ""Le Origini bella Poesia di Giuseppe Ungaretti."" The latter book, on a contemporary Italian poet, will be published in Italy."

Belknap for the purpose of establishing for the Humanities department, a library of critical works. The honorarium is a gift to the department in recognition of their outstanding work in preparing the Humanities Lecture Series. Although the motion for the grant has been unanimously passed, the allocation of the exact amount of money must be approved by John Burke, Assistant Director of King's Crown Activities, who will examine the budget and determine what appropriation is feasible."

113,Curriculum Will Undergo Modifications,18 September 1962,"By Andrew B. SchultzColumbia's general education program, though firmly established for many years as among the country's earliest and best, will undergo some experimentation during the undergraduate career of the Class of 1966. A two-yea»r program of Contemporary Civilization was reviewed by a faculty committee in 1961. The committee suggested a three-year suspension of the muchcriticized interdepartmental CCB course, which attempted to cover the political, economic, and social theories of the twentieth century. Many students believed that the course was too general to be useful, and teachers deemed the scope of the course too broad to be adequately taught by a single in-structor. In the fall of 1961, a new series of departmental offerings was substituted for the oi# COB course. courses in history, government, economics, sociology and anthropology were made available for second year students. This program, now going into its second year, will be evaluated this year. The OCA course, a full-year study of philosophical trends from the medieval era to the nineteenth century, will remain intact. An advanced course in English A will be instituted this year in response to calls for a more sophisticated approach to challenge outstanding freshmen. The course, called ""Introduction to Literary Study,"" will be a half-year offer-ing, open to students with high scores on the advanced placement tests. Those who satisfactorialy pass the literature course will be exempted from the traditional English A full-year course which aims at bolstering basic language skills such as grammar, spelling, and expository writing. Plans to extend the foreign language requirement from two to three years have been approved by the Committee on Instruction, the College's highest curriculum unit. But final action has been deferred, at least until next year. This means that members of the Class of '66 will fulfill the language requirement if they complete a fourth-term course with a grade of B- or better, or a fifth-term remedial offering with a passing grade. It is expected that . the toughened three-year standard willbe adopted within the next two years, pending further reevaluation of the over-all College program. Addition of a third-year to the language requirement is necessitated by advances in secondary school instruction and better preparation by incoming freshmen before they enter Columbia. Humanities A, a year-long study of world literature from Homer to Dostoevski, and Humanities B, consisting of two separate one-se-mester introductory offerings in the fields of art and music, will continue to be integral facets of the College's general education program. No serious criticisms of the courses have been expressed in recent years, but an interdepartmental faculty group has been appointed to look into the Humanities program. The committee, chaired by Associate Professor ofHistory Fritz Stern, will -report by mid-1963. Perhaps the most controversial requirement in Columbia College is the two-year science program. Four semesters of courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, psychology, astronomy, and geology are currently required. Students may select two full-year courses in different sciences or two years of study in one scientific field. Last March, John G. Palfrey, former dean of the College, proposed a new program of courses in the history of science. A committee headed by Higgins Professor of Physics I. I. Rabi was formed to develop a series of courses. No courses, however, will be offered in the coming year. A faculty spokesman explained that specialists in the history of science are few, and it will take time to implement a well-coordinated program at Columbia. The establishment of a department of science history will not affect the College science requirement in the near future, but such a program might well prompt serious discussion of the value of technical science courses for the liberal arts major."
114,Committee Will Probe Courses In Humanities Stern Named Select Nine-Man Unit,2 October 1962,"Stern Named Select Nine-Man UnitBy Andrew B. SchultzA faculty committee has been established to reevaluate the College's two-year Humanities program. The nine-member group, headed by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern, will probably report its findings sometime next year. It has already met once. Professor Stern was quick to point out that little opposition to the structure of the Humanities sequence had been expressed since its beginning. But a thorough look was needed because ""it hasn't been examined in over 25 years,"" he said. At least three proposals to revise Humanities have been reported in recent years. Possible coordination of Humanities A and English A would mean development of three point offerings in each subject, with more emphasis on composition work and less classroom analysis of the works. A second idea would involve a broad revamping of current literature, art, and music courses. Under this suggestion students would study a particular era intensively in all three fields at the same time. Integration of the College's planned three-year language requirement with Humanities A has also been suggested. Each of these proposals has some adherents, but no widespread support has been attracted for any of the three. It is understood that an attempt has been made to appoint men to the Stern Committee who were not identified with any of the proposals brought forth in the past. Members of the new group, in addition to Professor Stern, are Associate Professor of Music Jack Beeson, Associate Professor of Philosophy Arthur C. Danto, Professor of Chinese and Japanese William T. deßary, Associate Professor of French Bert M-P. Leefmans and Associate Professor of Greek andLatin Howard N. Porter. Also Professor of English Lionel Trilling, Associate Professor of Government Alan F. Westin, and Professor of Art History Rudolf Wittkower. Dean of Faculties and Provost Jacques Barzun and Acting Dean John W. Alexander are serving as ex officio members."
115,Coarse Evaluation Booklet,4 October 1962,"""Philosophy G4107: The reading list is not long but is difficult as the subject is controversial. There are two papers of moderate length (7-10 pages), which do not take long to write. They are analytical, always pertinent to the material discussed in class. The text, costing $7, is very good. No background is required, but some knowledge of Plato and Aristotle, plus a little idea of philosophical inquiry is recommended. CC A and Humanities A are consicL dd sufficient J^d£groimd. stimulating; interesting, and necessary; the discussions, first-rate."" The citation is from the course evaluation booklet published by the Ted Kremer Society and Action this year. To be fair to the booklet and its authors, the quotation is among the worst selections in the tenpage publication, but it illustrates some of the booklet's major faults. For whom do the papers ""not take long to write?"" Would the text be less than ""very good"" if it costs less than $7? How big is ""a little idea of philosophical inquiry?"" Would the discussions be ""first-rate"" even with a class of third-rate students? The description of Philosophy G4107 (The booklet doesn't say so, but it's Moral Philosophy.) shows the haste with which the survey was prepared and the mediocrity it exemplifies. It would be unfair, however, to dismiss the booklet out of hand. It was the first venture of its kind at Columbia, and it was an attempt to fill the need for information on courses to supplement the blurbs in the Catalogue. This need has long been recognized at other Ivy League colleges, some of whose booklets leave good taste far behind —ifi their reckless assaults on faculty members. The editors of the Columbia booklet are aware of its deficiencies. They know that their effort is by no means complete, representing only a meager cross-section of the College Catalogue. They also know that their descriptions are not backed by the authority of a large student sampling. Their attitude, therefore, is commendable. They should not be discouraged by the result of their first effort. We hope the Ted Kremer Society and Action will try for a better product this year—with more student cooperation."
116,Jim Stallman: A 'Phenomenal' Person,17 October 1962,"""James Stallman was a phenomenal athlete, a phenomenal student, and a phenomenal per sonality,"" a friend said yesterday of the Columbia sophomore who died after being hit by a car Friday night. Stallman held four freshman swimming records. Although he was captain of the freshman swimming team, he was never elected or appointed; ""everybody just looked to him for leadership."" Winner of the outstanding freshman swimmer award, he was high scorer and set four freshman records. ""His quiet strength and leadership made others on the team draw on him for power; he was the bastion and backbone of the whole team,"" Gary Nyman '63, captain of the varsity swimming team, said. A pre-med, his favorite course was Humanities A. Although asan athlete he had little extra time, he read other classics besides the required works. He took his studies as seriously as his swimming, finding time tobe a freshman week host and a dormitory council representative. He participated in the new undergraduate freshman advisory program; freshmen came constantly to his room with their problems at all hours. He never turned anyone away, no matter what time it was or what he had to do. He went out of his way to find good high school students and show them Columbia was the place to go because he had such a deep love for Columbia. His last four hours of life were spent recruiting a prospective Columbia student. Swimming coach Dick Steadman said, ""He was the dream of every coach."" ""When he walked into a crowd of people he didn't say anything but people just went toward him; he had a sort of radiance,"" a friend recalled.James C. Stallman"
117,Spare Humanities,19 October 1962,"Two recent announcements by Columbia and Harvard indicate that those two colleges, leaders in establishing general education as a principle of undergraduate schooling in America, have their doubts about its character in the modern college. Harvard, fearful that piecemeal changes are being made in general education without an over-all view of the program, is seeking a general plan for action. Columbia, which has been altering the general education sequence in recent years, seems intent on evaluating courses individually. The latest addition to the list of ""suspect"" courses is the two-year Humanities sequence. A faculty committee has been appointed to take a thorough look at Humanities. Its membership (it includes teachers from the departments of history, music, philosophy, Chinese and Japanese, French, Greek and Latin, English, art history and government) indicates that Humanities has become the concern of more departments than contribute teachers for it. The official justification the study is innocent enough. Professor Stern, chairman of the committee, has said that Humanities ""has not been examined in over 25 years."" - • It would be rash to assume that the faculty is disenchanted with the Humanities program and would advocate its radical revision. Nevertheless, in view of the prevalent reluctance to leave general education alone, it would be foolish to believe that major changes are not being contemplated. In fact, the committee may well have to contend with the broad questions posed by the 1957 report on the Educational Future of Columbia University. The report expressed ""concern at the amount of material now compressed in Contemporary Civilization and Humanities,"" not because of a ""desire to make the Lower College program easier,"" but because of a ""wish to make the program more rigorous and more conducive to the development of intellectual habits ot precision, thoughtfulness, and exact mastery of materials."" Despite the temptation to intensify the Undergraduate training in preparation for graduate study, we urge the Humanities committee not to tamper with the currentprogram. There is little doubt that the breadth of the Humanities courses is their greatest asset. Generations of College students have found great personal satisfaction in humanities A. They have been given the opportunity to read and examine works that otherwise would have escaped them. Although the Humanities study of Spinoza, for example, does not produce ""exact mastery"" of the philosophical material or of the particular philosophical method, it has the virtue of exposing students to the subject and encouraging further investigation. The second year of Humanities, moreover, traditionally invites students to areas heretofore completely foreign to them. Rather than limiting second year courses in any way, we would recommend that they deal more with modern trends in music and art. As has been said so often before, the Humanities sequence is supposed to whet the appetite, not to satisfy it. We cannot believe that high schools have advanced so rapidly that Humanities has become a waste of time for colleges. Until secondary school education takes on the functions that Humanities now serve, radical innovations in the sequence are unwarranted."

119,Scheduling Finals Is An Intricate Task,7 December 1962,"By Arthur J. GrebowTo most Columbia students, the final examination schedule is one of the most eagerly awaited, yet most often detested documents that they receive each year. The schedule, which will be available shortly before the Christmas vacation, is the end result of six to eight weeks of concentrated work by Assistant Registrar David F. Genero '58 GS, and one of his associates. ""Before the 1958-59 academic year,"" Mr. Genero remarked, ""each course was listed with an examination group number and no student could register for two courses with the same number. Because of the increase in the number of College courses, however, it became necessary to modify this system.""When work begins on the schedule, the courses given at the same time during the year are listed together as a group. Each group is then given an examination time and day. Large multi-section courses such as CC A and English A as well as foreign language courses, are generally at separate examination times. In order to obtain the smallest number of conflicts and the most reasonable spread of examinations for each student, Mr. Genero considers the typical program for each major. He has also devised, a system in which each student's program is checked within the eighteen possible examination times. If conflicts or bunching is prevalent for a number of students taking the samecourses, one of the examinations may be re-scheduled. This term, for example, the CC A examination and the Humanities A examination are tentatively scheduled for consecutive afternoon and morning periods in the expectation that few students would be taking these courses during the same year. ""If we find, however, that too many boys are taking these two courses together,"" Mr. Genero said, ""we may change the time of one of the examinations."" ""Unfortunately it is impossible to resolve some conflicts,"" he added. ""Psychololgy CllOl, for example, is one of the few courses that meets at noon and conflicts with it simply cannot be avoided with the limited time periods that we now have."" As a result, conflict examinations are given in this course as well as in most of the multi-section courses. There are now about a hundred students taking less than twelve conflict examinations. ""The increasing number of coursesin the College is making it more and more difficult to work out a •good examination schedule each year. Since a great number of undergraduates are now taking courses in Barnard, G.S., and Graduate Faculties than ever before we have an even more complex situation."" The best solution to this problem, Mr. Genero believes, would be to add at lea.st one extra day to the current calendar. Some examinations that had previously been given in the gymnasium wil] now, as a result of the large number of students enrolled in the course, be given either in separate classrooms or divided among the gym and other rooms. The maximum number of students who can be tested in the gym at one time is 763. There are currently over eight hundred students registered for both English A and CC A. ""We are eagerly awaiting the completion of the new gymnasium,"" Mr. Genero jokingly remarked."

LambertPlayers' Experimental Theater will present its second production of tine year, five one-act plays, tonight and tomorrow evening. The Theater will put on four productions d/uring tihe year as part of a reorganized Players which includes a Classical Theater, drama and staging classes, and the Experimental Theater. The five plays—four by Columbia students—wild appear at Minor Latham Theater.

In about one month, Players will begin its presentation of classical theater in Wollman Auditorium. Designed as a supplement to Humanities A, the drama group willgive readings of many Greek classics that are not on the reading ■list. Each reading will run two orthree days in Wollman. ""Very few of the classics ever see the stage any more,"" noted David Rubinson,general manager of Players. ""While we can't affoi-d to present fully staged productions, highly polished readings are - very possible."" Classes in drama, lighting, and staging are being given several times a week by Tony Quintavalla, graduate president of Players.

121,Changes Proposed for Humanities A,7 February 1963,"The Student Academic Affairs Committee suggested yesterday a combination of Humanities A and English A in a report evaluating the Humanities sequence. The Committee also suggested a compulsory weekly lecture in Humanities A, and an improvement of the Humanities Fine Arts course.The report, prepared for the faculty committee studying the Humanities curriculum, was the group's first project. The committee was formed in January and serves as an advisory 'body to the Dean's Office. The report summarized different views expressed during discussion rather than the consensus of the group. There was strong support for making Humanities A a compulsory freshman course and combining it with English A. The report said that such a move would offer the student a greater opportunity for writing in Humanities, eliminate the ""innane quizzes that the students so resent,"" and would give the body of essays required in English A greater consistency. The Committee also recommended that a compulsory weekly lecture supplement the class work. This lecture would be similar to those now sponsored by the Board of Managers and would be presented by a specialist selected by the Humanities department. Suggestions were also made toprovide an alternate plan for students with sufficient background in Humanities. This ""specific course"" would cover less material in a more detailed and comprehensive manner. Although the Humanities Music course met with general approval the Fine Arts course was subject to much criticism.The Committee felt that a ""carefully structured guidance,"" of great importance to the average student who lacks a firm background in art, is definitley missing. The students maintained that this course has an ""unusual concentration of poorly communicative teachers"" and therefore requires more departmental supervision of individual instructors. Some students expressed interest in a revision favored by former Dean Palfrey to introduce large lectures into the course. Several Committee members further criticized the course for it ""almost completely disregarding"" the many museums and art collections in New York City. The group also discussed the possibility of making some kind of oriental study compulsory. It felt that the introduction of one or two oriental works into * Humanities A would be sufficient."
122,Letter,7 February 1963,"To the Editor: When course numbers were changed two years ago it was explained that the new numbers were necessary for purposes of coordination with the new IBM punchcard registration system. It was assumed that the new numbers, such as ClOllx, would be Used by the IBM system and we, the student body, therefore acquiesced to the might of that metallic bureaucracy. But as it turns out, these numbers are not being used by the IBM machines. Instead, female office workers of vegetable IQ's look up the course numbers on a master list of other numbers and then place another appropriate number on another card to be keypunched. The courses could still just as well be called CCB2 or Humanities A 2 as CC C1202y or Humanities C1002y! Down with the idiot (IBM) cards and back with the more human Stupidity of pre-IBM registration. Feb. 5, 1963 Martin B. Flamm"
123,Secondary Sources Prepared For Humanities A Program,11 February 1963,"By Jonathan SteinA recent book edited by Professors of English Quentin Anderson and Joseph A. Mazzeo has revealed a new conception of the Humanities A course.The volume, entitled ""The Proper Study"" (St. Martin's Press), contains a collection of critical essays on twenty-eight western authors most of whom appear in the humanities course. Professor 'Lionel Trilling, 'in the introduction to the book, explains why there was a need to prepare a collection of these secondary source criticisms. He writes that, 'The great books do not have their being, as we seemed to imply, in splendid classic isolation or only in a kind of royal isolation to each other. They exist in the lively milieu that is created by the responses that have long been given to them."" Professor Trilling proceeds to answer 'the criticism that a secondary source ""corrupts"" the student who is reading the original works. ""What we mean by fresh innocence,"" he says, ""is often a bland passivity, and if it is, then how fortunate the fall from that Eden!"" Professor Mazzeo points out that the work is ""not a trot"" and doesnot provide the student with any formulas. He does not see the book as a substitute for reading the original works. The volume has not been recommended far use in the Humanities A course. Professor Mazzeo said that use of the book is up to the individual instructor's discretion. Although the book has not been designed to be used as a text for the course, Professor Mazzeo believes that there are possibilities for such a use. Critical essays by men like Erich Auerbach, F. M. Cornford, George Santayana, Richard Chase and Werner Jaeger have been included. All the authors in Humanities A are included in addition to essays on Wordsworth, Stendahl, Melville, James and Freud."
124,Inhumanity to Humanities,13 February 1963,"The first report of the new Academic Affairs Committee is the embodiment of all the fears and almost none of the hopes that were held for the student group when it was revived earlier this year. The report deals with both years of the Humanities sequence. The authors apparently felt compelled to present all the suggestions made during the committee's discussion, with no distinction between good and bad ones. These suggestions of varying quality are mired in prose that make the report's most powerful point an inadvertent demand for extension of the College's remedial English program. The following is representative, not extreme: ""This program would consist of a reconstruction of the entire course into a set-up that would consist of a mixture of large lectures and recitations."" The report tells us that there was a ""strong suggestion"", (strongly presented? strongly supported? strong in its effect and hard to take, like horse-radish?) that Humanities A and English A be ""formally"" united. The proposal is aimed at increasing the amount of writing in Humanities A, ending the ""inane quizzes"" by substituting a weekly theme on the Humanities selection, restricting the use of ""ponies,"" and promoting ""deeper thought about each author and work."" What do the authors mean by a ""formal"" union? Is one course to be swallowed by the other? If the Humanities quizzes are supplanted by themes in English classes, who is to mark them? If the Humanities teachers must mark them, the themes must be distributed from one English teacher to several Humanities instructors and then returned—no small logistics problem. If the English A course is to be absorbed by Humanities, we must question whether all those who now teach Humanities are also qualified to teach writing. If the Humanities course is to be absorbed by English A, we must ask what will happen to all the talented Humanities teachers from departments other than English. The committee makes a reasonable point with the rhetorical question: ""... is it fair to consider that civilization from recorded time has ended at the Mediterranean?"" No, it is not fair. Yes, it would be lovely, if ""one or two oriental works could be introduced into Humanities A."" But Humanities as it stands, dealing only with Western literature, is already sketchy and jammed with readings. What would the authors eliminate to make room for their oriental works? Those who devised the Humanities course were faced with a finite school year and had to limit themselves to Western culture. The school year is still finite and Western culture is still large enough for Humanities A. Another proposal calls for the creation of a course for freshmen already familiar with the material in Humanities A. The new course, unhappily labelled ""specific Humanities,"" would be more advanced than Humanities A and could include a sizeable ""morsel"" of oriental literature. But we already have Humanities -3-4, an advanced course open to freshmen who achieve Humanities A; we also have Oriental Humanities. The suggestion, therefore, is well-intended but superfluous. Dealing with teaching in Humanities A, the committee expresses satisfaction with the present role of the teacher as an ""en-lightened guide""—that is, as teacher. It condemns ""very structured guidance through large lectures,"" but endorses a compulsory weekly lecture similar to the Board of Managers' series. The usage here gets a bit involved, but we assume that ""guidance"" means allowing the students to do most of the talking, that ""structured guidance"" means allowing the students to do a small amount of talking, and that ""very structured guidance"" is a ten dollar phrase for lecture. Keeping this set of definitions in mind, we would prefer ""structured guidance"" to ""guidance"" in the classroom, and would rather not see a delightful and optional lecture series become compulsory ""very structured guidance."" A student comes here to learn from his teachers, and the exchange of opinions — uninformed and otherwise — with other students is at best a complement to lecture. Columbia has recognized this and puts off seminars until the senior year, when a student has sufficient background in one subject to hold forth intelligently about it. Humanities A should not become a freshman seminar. As to making the Ferris Booth lectures compulsory, it would seem that much of their success is due to the fact that they are optional. Teachers may present material to students they know are there to listen, and need not worry about filling prescribed demands. Attendance sheets, tests, and all the other paraphernalia of compulson would destroy what has been a valuable experience for interested students. The three-page report closes with one page on the Music and Fine Arts offerings. It makes the astounding observation that Humanities MB ""met with comparatively little criticism,"" and then proceeds to criticize the Fine Arts course in terms which could have been applied to the Music course. The concentration on one section of the course at the expense of others is common to both courses, though the report presents it as unique to Fine Arts. Nor is it wholly undesirable. Devoting a large amount of time to the Parthenon or to Baroque music is designed to show a student how to evaluate critically a work of art or a piece of music. The courses emphasize that this skill may be applied to works of other periods. Neither course spends enough time on modern movements. This is unfortunate but hardly disastrous. The report is bad, but what can be done to improve future reports? First, the committee must rid itself of the compulsion to present every idea as the equal of every other. If it is going to make a suggestion, let that suggestion be backed with reasoned support, not dropped timorously and without elaboration before the faculty. Second, the committee's deliberations must be above the level of dormitory bull sessions. If there is research to be done, let it be done. Any repetition of the committee's first performance will finish faculty-student consultation on the Columbia campus."
125,Letter to the Editor,14 February 1963,"To the Editor: In the two and a half years I have been at Columbia, I have been struck time and again by the unorthodox way in which Spectator fulfills its role as the gadfly. The conventional image of the gadfly is of one who fearlessly and objectively analyses situations which have gone unanalyzed, and, in so doing, comes to conclusions that irritate others, and perhaps cause them to think, where before they had been asleep. The Spectator has generally aroused irritation and spurred thought not by exercising the classic virtues, but by showing ignorance and sloppy thinking. An example of the Spectator's frequent incompetence is the editorial on the first report of the Academic Affairs Committee. That editorial criticizes the suggestion to combine Humanities A and English A, and notes only three possible mechanisms for this combination. If Humanities A swallows English A, or vice versa, the article notes, we will be placed in the sorry position of having English teachers teaching Humanities, or vice versa. The committee did not suggest this, and the editor has made a neat refutation, or at least a valid criticism only of a position which he himself lias created. A good point if he were writing a dialogue, but out of place in a criticism of what the committee did suggest. In stating that having humanities themes marked by both English A and Humanities A teachers would involve ""no small logistics problem,"" he doesn't mention the possibility of having coinciding sections, i.e. of having all students in a given English section in a single humanities section. In short, his criticism is long on talk, short on thought. The beautiful argument next advanced, which is against the inclusion of an Oriental work or two in the Humanities A sequence is that the editor cannot think of anything that we should discard to make room for the new works. Isn't it obvious that there is already a competition among great works for inclusion in the sequence, and that perhaps one essential cultural element is not getting the time concomitant [sic] with its importance? ""Western culture is large enough for Humanities A"" the article exclaims, as if this were the issue. The question the committee raised was not one of the scope of Western Culture, but of whether or not Humanities A is at present meeting the cultural requirements it was designed to meet. It is the breadth of the cultural background that we are going to make compulsory that is at issue, not whether or not Western Literature supplies us with enough material for two terms of reading. As an alternative to the special Humanities A section proposed by the committee, which would cater to those who had a semi-working knowledge of the classics before they came to Columbia, the editor points to Oriental Humanities and to Humanities 3-4. If he will consult his catalogue, or look at a reading list or two, he will see that Humanities 3-4 covers the chronological period of ca. 1775-present, an area substantially omitted in Humanities A. As for the further criticism of inclusion of Oriental works in Hum. A because we already have a course in Oriental Civilization, I need only point to the facts that Plato, Aristotle, and Spinoza surely are studied in Philosophy courses, Shakespeare in English courses, Montaigne and Voltaire in Frence courses, Dostoevsky in Russian department courses, to show that inclusion in other courses is no grounds for rejecting a book as a part of an introductory course. The committee's recommendation that the weekly Ferris Booth Hall lectures be made compulsory was criticized via the contention that making the teachers take attendance,and giving him a larger audience tend to make him lose some of the enthusiasm he would have had in an informal setting; and that filling out an attendance sheet will ruin ""what has been a valuable experience for interested students."" This .is nonsense. The interested student will not lose his interest because he must sign in. The teacher who loses his interest in an upcoming lecture because he, being recognized by the university at large as the foremost man on campus in a given subject, must lecture to the whole humanities A student body, would be hard to find, and would not, I believe, be found among present lecturers in the FBH series. The honor and opportunity of such a lecture would go a long way towards compensating for the loss of zest caused by the necessity to take attendance. In short, the interested student would get as much as he did before, and the less enthusiastic would get as much as he possibly could. As a member of the committee who is concerned with its development and long term success, I will not deny that it has many faults. Its discussion of the art and music course were not nearly as thorough as they should have been. The discussion was Knitted because we had little time, and many ideas. This, of course, does not absolve us from the criticismthat we should have taken all the time we needed before handing in a report. I do wish that the Spectator criticism be the conclusion of thought, not just conclusions quickly set in print, and I urge the Spectator and the college as a whole to remember that the committee is, for the college, a student-faculty relational innovation. It has none but the negative precedent of Student Board to serve as a guide. Its stature in the college community, the influence it will have both with the students and with the faculty is not set down in writing, but is being slowly developed as the members of the faculty and of the committee appraise themselves, the students, and the current situation. It must make mistakes and be less than one hundred per cent efficient at first; this the faculty certainly recognizes, and the Spectator prediction of a swift demise of faculty-student consultation is totally unfounded. Arlan Cohen '64 Member, Academic Affairs Committee Feb.. 13, 1963(Editor's Note: If Mr, Cohen and his colleagues on the Academic Affairs Committee were not""asleep"" when they discussed and wrote their report on Humanities they might not have been led to conclude that Spectator, in crticizing the committee's product, was acting as gadfly. When dealing with a report as careless and muddled as the Humanities report, Spectator acted more as a textual analyst than anything else. Similarly, if the committee had made its suggestions explicit and in English, Spectator would not have been driven to speculate on the possible meanings of the report. Perhaps we did not discover all that might have been interred in the minds of committee members when they made their suggestions. But mind-reading has never been our forte. We do not ivish to see the demise of student-faculty consultation. We merely said — and by this we stand — that if the committee cannot do better, its voice should fall on deaf ears. As to this demise being ""swift,"" we believe that the speed of the demise may well correspond to the speed with which the committee prepares its reports. Since rapidity is not an academic virtue, we suggest again that the committee take its time with future reports. We would father it be sluggish than sloppy.)"
126,Academic Affairs Unit Plans Additional Humanities Work,18 February 1963,"By Joseph T. Lambert""The report on Humanities A was submitted with some degree of finality only because Dean Alexander wanted it by a certain date,"" according to Jan Breslow '63, chairman of the Academic Affairs Committee. He was replying to last Wednesday's Spectator editorial, which criticized the report as sloppy and incomplete. At a meeting of the committee on Friday, Breslow said that he regarded the report as ""minutes of the last meeting. I think we should go on from there."" One member, Kenneth Prager '64, noted that the committee, ""should be very clear on how their discussion will be incorporated into future reports. At the last meeting, we didn't really know what was going to happen to what we said.""Future discussion on Humanities A and other aspects of the curriculum will be referred to subcommittees on particular problems and then reviewed by the committee of the whole. The report submitted to Dean Alexander prompted differing opinions from the committee. It was brought out 'that the Humanities and English faculty generally disagreed with the idea of combining the English A and Humanities A courses or of making the Humanities course a freshman requirement. The Academic Affairs Committee will be working in conjunction with the student committee on Contemporary Civilization to present a unified report to the Dean's Office."
127,'Direct Confrontation' Favored Proposed Secondary Sources For Humanities A Criticized,19 February 1963,"Proposed Secondary Sources For Humanities A CriticizedBy Jonathan KatzThree professors who leach Humanities A have criticized Professor of English Lionel Trilling's opinion that critical and interpretive essays are useful supplementary readings for Humanities A students. Professor Trilling states in his introduction to ""The Proper Study,"" a collection of critical essays on Humanities A authors, that great books do not exist in isolation, but stand in a milieu of the responses that have been given them over the ages. He believes it is helpful for the students to read scholarly criticisms of original works as well as the works themselves. Professor of French Donald M. Frame, however, is opposed to use of secondary sources. ""Students."" he said, ""should be pushed into the experience of a direct confrontation with the text."" ""I like my students to do their own thinking and arrive at their own conclusions about the books they read,"" said Associate Professor of Spanish- Leonardo C. DeMorelos. He also thought that more interpretive material would not only require elimination of some of the important original texts, but would also ""be foreign to the traditional purpose of the course."" Assistant Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap said most college students ""tend to want to be told what Plato meant in his Dialogues. I would not be anxious to back a book that would propose to tell him that. If a student wants to know what Plato said, let him read Plato."""

130,Board of Managers Announces New Faculty Lecture Series,27 February 1963,"By Harry M. KreskyThe Board of Managers has initiated a new lecture series, ""A Focus on the Contemporary."" The program, consisting of lectures by Columbia professors on subjects of particular interest to them, is designed to give the student an opportunity to become better acquainted with the personal ideals of his professors. Paul Katerman, '64 who heads the project, pointed out that this personal insight is not possible in class because of the strict outlines of course material. Also, many students might not have a chance to take a particular course. Katerman commented that ""the idea of having faculty members speak on subjects of particular interest to them, in an unrestricted lecture series, is a concept totally new to Columbia."" He contrasted the series to ""Lectures in the Light of Humanities,"" also sponsored by the Board of Managers, in which a professor speaks on a topic related to the Humanities A course. Dustin Rice, associate professor of art history, is scheduled as the first speaker in the new series. He will discuss ""Contemporary Art in New York"" on March 6. Other speakers in the series are Charles O. Beckman, professor of chemistry; Adolph A, Berle, profes-sor of law; Raymond J. Sauliner, professor of economics; Warner R. Schilling, associate professor of government; and James P. Shenton, associate professor of history."

132,Truman Urges Study Of Basic Courses,7 March 1963,"Dean David 8., Truman has called for a re-evaluation of general education at Columbia. He said in .a recent interview that Although he had no radicaireforms in 'mind, he felt that a comprehensive study of the system was needed periodically. No specific plans have been made for the study, but Dean Truman suggested that it might be of the same scope as the Maemalhon Committee's 1957 report on ""The Educational Future of Columbia University."" Although changes have been made in the past few years fei the College's 'requirements, the Dean emphasized that ""we need a -much -more intensive study of general! education at the college level."" He compared his proposed study to the one now being conducted by a faculty cornmtiittee at Harvard. He noted that the Harvard committee had recently visited Columbia to investigate genera! education here. Without speculating on the findings and irecommendations of the study, Dean Truman said that he could not envision a general education system at Columbia without Humanities A and Contemporary Civilization A. In recent years, faculty committees have been formed to study the CC B and the Humanities requirements. The CC B committee, headed by Dean Truman, recommended in 1961 that the Old CC B course be replaced as a requirement for a three-year experimental! l period (by a group of introductory departmental courses. A committee headed by Professor of Economics Louiis Hacker has just reported on the experiment to the College's Committee on Irtstructiion. Earlier this year, -another committee was named to review 'the Humanities curriculum. Dean Truman reported that it is ""moving systematically through a series of agreed-upon topics."" A final report will probably be ready before the end of the term. The committee has most recent-ly discussed the second-year Huim'anittes courses. The Dean noted that ""they have taken up the problems associated with museum visits and concent attendance."" The only recent proposal for a Change in the language requirement was rejected last November by the Committee on Instruction. The Language Committee had reCommended that the requirement Ibe increased from two to three years. It argued that the present program does not provide the student with a ""proper command"" of a foreign language. The last major change in the science requirement took place in 1961. The faculty voted to eliminate the 'three categories from which students had to fill their requirement 'and allow them to take ■theiir two years in any field of their choice. In 1958 Health Education was dropped as a required course and the ■physical education requirement was reduced from three to two years. —D.G."

135,Hadas Counters Shenton Speech,18 March 1963,"By Stanford N. SesserJay Professor of Greek Moses Hadas said Friday that he ""would look with great apprehension"" on eliminating general education courses from the College curriculum. His comment was in response to remarks made Wednesday by Associate Professor of History James P. Shenton. According to Professor Shenton, general education is primarily designed to ""meet inadequacies of the high school program,"" and.must be deemphasized as high schools expand their advanced placement programs. Professor Hadas, who teaches a section of Humanities A, said that the course, if necessary, ""could be made more rigorous and advanced."" He states that if readings in the course are introduced into high schools, they would be replaced at Columbia by ""new and harder books."" According to Professor Hadas, general education in college is necessary because ""what people learn as children won't answer."" He doubts that more than ""rote learning"" can be accomplished in highschool courses. 'In commenting on a proposed course system for Columbia, Dr. Hadas said he wouldn't want to see a change unless the merits of the course system are definitely established. He believes the point systemhas worked ""very well."" In his lecture Wednesday, Professor Shenton noted a trend in high schools toward introducing courses similar to Contemporary Civilization. He said that ""once high schools begin this program, general education might become unnecessary. . . . You don't want to come to college for a repeat performance.""Professor Shenton believes that the American high schools are"" rapidly approaching their European counterparts in the quality of course offerings. Dr. Shenton proposes that the fourth year of college be devoted to independent supervised research, ""the equivalent of a master's year."" He says that a year of independent study ""teaches you not how to master many things, but to master one thing and master it well."" In answer to a question on the point system, Professor Shenton said that students now ""take four courses and two guts. This means i they're wasting their time."" He stated that he has ""never had a more rewarding experience"" than theteaching of an eight-point seminar this year. Assistant Professor of Russian Robert L.

136,A Palpable Hit,16 April 1963,"In light of our recent comments about educational experimenting, it is gratifying that one of the College's own experiments has proved ""an incredible success."" This description is by Professor Howard Schless, the English Department's representative. The experiment is the ""Introduction to Literary Study"" course which has been offered to freshmen with superior ability in English as a one-term alternative to the usual freshmen English course. Our satisfaction comes not only from the practical success of the course, however. It embodies principles and methods which deserve praise. The course fits well into the Columbia curriculum. Its intensive study of a single text has been described as ""an antidote to Humanities."" While Humanities A is hardly poison, the depth of the English offering is a useful contrast to the breadth of Humanities. While the course has a narrow focus, its outlook is broad. Consideration of one work of Chaucer, Milton or Shakespeare illuminates the whole process of literary study. Its structure is also significant. The small class size is used to good advantage by making written work of the students a subject for class discussion. Thus the students' reaction to the text takes its proper place with the text itself. One of the two papers required involves research, and in that sense parallels the experience of the second term of freshman English. The literary study program will be offered again next year. We hope that it will be expanded too. At present, sophomores interested in an English major may be admitted by special permission. Provisions for other non-freshmen would extend the benefits of this valuable program."

139,Student Group Asks Advent Of Honor Code Report Suggests Steps Toward Future Plan,1 May 1963,"Report Suggests Steps Toward Future PlanA student committee has presented the Dean's Advisory Committee with a report outlining steps leading to the institution of an honor code in the College. The report, which was drawn up by Donald R. Mintz '64, also presents the results of a recent experiment with unproctored midterm examinations. The Dean's Advisory Committee is composed of heads of several student activities. As proposed by Mintz, the plan requires the formation of a oneyear experimental committee to start a program of ""academic integrity."" The proposed committee would have eight members —four class presidents, the presidents of two service societies, and two members of the Academic Affairs Committee. At present, Mintz hopes to get the plan off to a token start next fall by requiring entering freshmen to sign a statement that they had read the code. This would not require adherence to the code, but would indicate that the student was familiar with the code's provisions. A suggestion was made by the Dean's Advisory Committee that since signing a statement indicating familiarity with the code did not require adherence, all students in the College should be asked to sign the statement. This would familiarize the entire College with the plan, and serve as a straw vote, testing student opinion. Those who objected to the proposed code could refuse to sign the cards. A step toward instituting an honor code was taken during the last mid-term period. At that time, unproctored exams were given tosix Humanities A classes. Students participating in the experiment signed a pledge stating that they would hot give or receive information during the exam. A majority of the students said that the unproctored system made them feel less tense. They expressed a desire to have unproctored exams administered regularly under the honor system. Dean David B. Truman stated yesterday that an honor code ""would work on this campus only as the student body becomes more cohesive. At the same time, he emphasized that an honor code could serve as a common goal for a student body working toward ""corporate identity""—a deep commitment to the college and its standards. Dean Truman cited two areas of potential failure for any honor code. One problem is the general reluctance of students to report infractions by their classmates. Another problem is created when attempts are made to extend the code out of the classroom."

141,DONALD M. FRAME Meet Mr. Professor,10 May 1963,"Meet Mr. ProfessorBy Peter RutterThe country's outstanding Montaigne scholar, a guiding force in the modern Humanities A program, and a regular competitor in the National Tennis Championships at Forest Hills are embodied in one man who has time and again demonstrated his personal excellence. Professor of French Donald M. Frame, in his 25 years at Columbia, has distinguished himself in teaching, private intellectual accomplishment, and personal off-campus activity. His merits have been recognized publicly with Guggenheim and Fulbright Fellowships and a continuing stream of published translations, essays, and biography of Michel de Montaigne and other figures of French literature. Professor Frame's interest in Montaigne has had an influence that has reached beyond the borders of academic life into the realization of his personal goals. ""Studying Montaigne,"" he states, ""has been one of the most important things to me. When I began reading his works as an instructor at Loomis, I found he had many ideas I needed in my own life. Montaigne says in On Repentance, T have my laws and my court to judge me.' I feel the moral independence thus expressed is something I've wanted to achieve—not that I've been completely successful."" Professor Frame adds that, ""Montaigne also has made it fascinating to study, and thereby orient, oneself. He realized, as does modern psychoanalysis, that conflict can be debilitating and self-aware-ness is the best defense against certain kinds of anxiety. I've applied this to myself. I suppose the most valuable idea of his that I've tried to realize is his conviction that there is a positive value to happiness."" Professor Frame's contribution to Columbia has been most notable in his administration of the Humanities A course and in his teaching of both French literature and Humanities. He has been teaching the latter course since beginning as an instructor in 1938. ""I'm crazy about Humanities A— it's one of the most exciting courses I've ever taught. It takestwice the preparation of any other course, but is easily worth it,"" he says. Professor Frame was chairman of the Humanities A program from 1950 to 1957 and feels his major contribution was the creation of a faculty committee to meet periodically and discuss the course. ""At first there wasn't enough discussion of the course — it didn't offer enough challenge to the instructors, and this reflects on the quality the students receive. This committee met, and still meets, informally to insure against complacency or unthinking change. It maintains a fresh approach to the course."" During the summer, on the Barnard courts and elsewhere, Professor Frame continues the interest he had in tennis when he won the 1932 Eastern Intercollegiate singles championship as a Harvard senior. He has competed at Wimbledon and in the Men's Nationals at Forest Hills, more regularly now that he has attained Senior status. Professor Frame's youthful blond crewcut and muscular six feet hide from the casual observer evidence of membership among these elder statesmen of the court. Professor Frame's continuing enchantment with Columbia stems from his first faculty dinner in1938, when he realized he was going to be ""in on the intellectual excitement, both among the facultyand the students. ""I like the academic commitment I see in class —the kind of response that will challenge your own ideas, not swallow them. I've also had the good fortune to work with colleagues I've liked and respected."" Since 1955 Professor Frame has been Columbia's adviser to the John Hay Fellows, a group of ten outstanding public high school teachers who each year come to Columbia for a sabbatical year of study. ""We don't follow any set program, but give the Fellows time to reach out. In our seminars we discuss many of the works of Humanities A. It's extremely stimulating — these are real salt-of-the-earth people."" Besides classroom instruction, Professor Frame's major interest during the school year is in continuing his work on various translations, which he occupies in spare moments. This summer, Professor Frame will continue his ""intellectual biography"" of Montaigne. Large blocks of time are needed for this in order to ""ingest the large body of information"" necessary for a biography.ON WISDOM: Professor of French Donald Frame, in his 25th year at Columbia, combines an active teaching and administrative program with writing essays, translations, and biography on Monaigne and other figures in French literature."
142,"Humanities, CC Plan Unproctored Midterms Teachers of First-Year Classes to Have Option Of Participation in Student Integrity Program",4 November 1963,"Teachers of First-Year Classes to Have Option Of Participation in Student Integrity ProgramBy Michael T. GenglerUnproctored midterm examinations will be given at the discretion of individual instructors to first year contemporary civilization and humanities classes, according to Donald Mintz '64, chairman of thestudent Commission on Academic Integrity. Professor of History Robert K Webb, chairman of the Contemporary Civilization program, and Associate Professor of Greek and Latin Howard N. Porter, Humanities A chairman, indicated their support for the experiment Friday. Professor Webb said that CC instructors will be notified of their option to give unproctored examinations today. Professor Porter, who gave an unproctored midterm to his humanities section Thursday, said that the experimental arrangement was ""satisfactory,"" and anticipated that most or all of the humanities instructors would cooperate with the Commission's plan. Procedure for the unproctored examinations is outlined in a leaflet to be passed out to classes when they take their exams. Students will receive exam questions from their instructors, who will answer questions about the exam and then leave the room. On the last written page of his exam, each student will sign a statement that he has taken the exam ""in accordance with the principles of academic integrity."" Dishonest activity may be reported to instructors by students, but reporting on other students is not compulsory. At the class meeting following the exam, students will be asked to complete a questionnaire which will help the Commission determine the success of the experiment. Among the topics covered by the questionnaire will be evidence of cheating observed duringthe exam. Student and faculty reaction to the Unproctored exam ""can make or break"" the honor system at Columbia, Mintz said. The unproctored exams are the second step in the Commission's announced program ""to create an atmosphere favorable to the eventual establishment of an honor system at the College,"" according to Mintz. The program began this fall with the distribution of letters requesting support for an honor system to the Class of '67. Freshmen were asked in the letter to sign a statement in which they acknowledged that ""it is wrong to fraudulently advance one's academic status or knowingly be a partner to another student's failure to maintain academic integrity."" Mintz said Friday that more than ninety per cent of the fresh-men had signed the pledge. Only the class of '67 will be involved in the plans for the honor system as they stand now. The Commission has adopted this limitation because it recognizes the difficulty of establishing an honor system, and is therefore proceeding slowly. The Commission was formed last spring by the Dean's office and the Student Advisory Committee on the basis of a report written in November 1962 by Mintz. In 1962, several unproctored examinations were given, and questionnaires similar to those to be used this year were distributed to the students participating. A majority of those students favored unproctored exams and reported they saw no cheating, but most students said they would not inform a student committee of cheating by others."
143,1963 is Year of Quiet Transition for Columbia,20 December 1963,"By Peter Rutter1963 at Columbia was a year in which quiet forces exerted what will probably turn out to be a strong influence in the University's history. The great upheavals and heated controversies remained in ,the background. Casually and unobtrusively, however, the events of the year may have gone more deeply into defining the purpose and charting the future of the University than had the rapid outward changes of previous years. At the College, Dean David B. Truman arrived and filleda gap that had left Columbia without a dean for a semester. He introduced himself to the student body with an all-college assembly and maintained a personal touch with the students in assemblies, dormitory visits, and an impeccable attendance record at the Thursday afternoon teas. The Dean began confronting the problems of the College: its role, its duty in expansion, its attempt to retain autonomy and small units in a large University and larger city. Dean Truman managed to establish a contact with the College that gave the students a feeling of affinity with, rather than distance from, the Dean's Office. Barnard, also,' had a new chief executive, formally inaugurating Rosemary Park as its second presiident in April. Many felt that the University lacked a coherent statement of unified purpose among its schools, but from a high administrative level came an emphatic statement of direction which was hailed as the possible groundwork for the future. In a historic speech at the Alumni Association's Alexander Hamilton Medal dinner, Vice President of the University Lawrence H. Chamberlain expressed the need for Columbia's concentrating its resources on specific areas of accomplishment. Kirk Gives Eulogy President Grayson Kirk announced the beginning of a Uni-versity-wide capital funds drive to enable Columbia to accomplish its goals. He indicated that he was in basic agreement with many of the principles stated by Dr. Chamberlain. Columbia's and the nation's former leader, Dwight D. Eisenhower, returned to campus to receive the Hamilton Medal and address the College students. But the following day the University and the world halted in shock over the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to wonder about the use of setting up long-range goals in a world suddenly laid bare to the savagery of humanity. President Kirk eloquently eulogized the late President at the University's special Memorial Service. ""The earth that this afternoon receives the shattered body of John Fitzgerald Kennedy is wet with the unashamed tears of an outraged mankind,"" said Dr. Kirk. He, as did all, tried to grasp the meaning of the tragedy. ""We must ask ourselves what good, what lessons we may take to our hearts from this crushing tragedy. ... If this experience through which we have passed does not chasten our hearts, and does not steel our determination to combat these forces of destruction about us, then may God help us, because we will not help ourselves."" With this, Columbia joined thecountry in facing a future that would never be the same. Amid constant change and threats to its basic purpose, the College in 1963 appointed committees of its scholars to re-examine the place of Humanities A and Contemporary Civilization B in its General Education program. There was debate about another of Columbia's educational roles, and after long years of waiting and red tape from Hartley Hall to Low Library, female guests were finally permitted in the undergraduate men's residence halls The College won an extension of the rather stringent hours this fall, but had the bulk of it immediately revoked when students staged the Ivy League's first panty raid this semester. Gym Drive Started The future was also the consideration, although many felt it was a much-too-distant future, in the official kickoff of the Gymnasium Fund's General Alumni Appeal. A second million-dollar gift was received, but the sports palace in the park was still only a blueprint. The University community was greatly saddened during the summer when it learned of the deaths of Professors George Nobbe and Francis Ryan. Professor Nobbe had retired in June along with Professors Charles Everett and George Hibbitt. Several members of the faculty left .Columbia for positions at other institutions or in industry. Jeffrey Hart and Bernard Wishy were among the losses from the College faculty. In addition, Robert Dallek, Stephen Smale and Walter Sokel announced their intentions to assume other posts. In the admissions office, an unintentional and temporary college expansion was caused by the acceptance of ninety extra members in the Class of '67. But not all of the campus events were in the form of thoughtful planning. The Columbia Review suddenly found itself a renegade publication, its Spring issue censored by the administration. Spectator Censured Another publication drew notice from the Dean's Office, which gave its official censure to Spectator for an editorial deploring alleged fraternity perversion during pledging. The newspaper continued arousing debate in the fall with a series of four editorials urging serious reconsideration of the future role of fraternities at Columbia. Spectator was concerned with free speech and other rights this summer, and an editorial in support of the March on Washington was read into the Congressional Record by Sen. Kenneth B. Keating. Political debate increased when the University consented to designate various hallways and crannies as official fallout shelters andposted yellow signs to indicate the locations. The signs soon became the targets of ink and crowbar but the administration persevered and approved plans to stock the shelters. The University also purchased additional property on Morningside. Despite the New York State Assembly's rejection of a bill which would have eased University expansion, Columbia acquired the last necessary land for the proposed east-campus superblock, and extended its holdings south of the campus. While new residence halls were being talked about, the present ones were embroiled in debate over a proposed room-rent rise of eighteen per cent. After tuition hikes over the last two years pre-vented the dorm rise, chances are strong that the trustees will approve it this year. A vacancy that still exists on the faculty was created when Dean of the School of Architecture Charles Colbert resigned, allegedly under pressure from the Administration. Other faculty changes saw Nobel Laureate T. D. Lee return to a Columbia professorship of physics and the establishment of a Douglas Mac Arthur chair in American History. Initiative in the College's development was also assumed by the students themselves. A newlyformed Commission on Academic Integrity instituted what may be the beginning of an honor system at Columbia by encouraging unproctored midterm exams and circulating an honor statement among incoming freshmen. College students exposed themselves nationally when the Glee Club took a western tour during Spring Vacation, and the College Band entertained a national television audience on the Tonight Show. Other entertainment took place as two undergraduates wrote the College's first varsity show in two years, ""Elsinore,"" and won an award for it. ""The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg"" was written by two Columbia students and produced this summer at Minor Latham Playhouse. Mme. Nhu Picketed Personalities considered undesirable by few or many were invited to speak, and despite eggthrowing at Mme. Ngo Dinh Nhu and strong protests against neoNazi James Madole, the Universitypresented a forum for all varieties of political opinion. 1963 was also a year for the frog jump, the all-cause protest, James Shenton on TV, a 11-S in the draft, and Jack Molinas in jail. It was a year for tennis courts in Riverside Park, a new faculty apartment building, new vending machines, and Friday nights in the Lion's Den. It was a year for famous bylines in Spectator while the New York newspapers were being struck for three months, for Eric Bentley singing Bertolt Brecht, for General Studies demanding a meaningful name, and for moving exams out of the gym—and for moving them back in. It was a year for picketing NROTC, for moving into 616, and for the Barnard student government to survive an abolition movement. It was the year that the Law School bridge was supposed to be finished, that two Columbia students were indicted for travel to Cuba, and that alumni sons were told to make up their minds early. It was a year of discovering that Sandy Koufax once went to G.S., that Stan Musial joined Yogi Berra in endowing a College scholarship, and that the Galindez thesis question was reopened. The subway kiosk question flared again, the Bank Street College of Education decided to move to Morningside, and two million dollars were given to the School of International Affairs.David B. Truman became Dean of Columbia College in February.COLUMBIANS PROTEST: Several Columbia students joined the throng of picketers who objected to the visit of Mme. Ngo Dinh Nhu to New York and Columbia.George Nobbe died this summer shortly after retiring as professor of English."
144,Changes in Humanities A Are Suggested by College Faculty Report Excerpts,9 January 1964,"Report Excerpts""Some members of the Committee [on the Humanities] thought the need for certain changes within the existing framework more urgent than others, but all of us agreed . . . that our two-year sequence in the Humanities not only introduces our students to an indispensable understanding of their intellectual, moral, and artistic heritage but also fosters and preserves for our students and for our faculty an intellectual community, a common experience of inestimable importance. . . . The purpose of these courses is admirable and their performance remarkably high."" 'Our greatest controversy developed over the proposal tointroduce (In Humanities A) critical secondary essays as required supplementary reading. The proponents of such a change argued that the addition of carefully selected critical masterpieces would acquaint the student with models of discourse and analysis, models which he would learn to criticize but which would also deepen his understanding and guide him in his own analysis of other great works."" ""We were alarmed by the relative decline in the number of senior faculty members teaching Humanities and by the consequent rise in the proportion of junior faculty teaching this course. . . . The departments must restore their full cooperation with the Humanities course."" ""We urge that the numbers of preceptors to be used in Humanities should be kept at a minimum."" ""Your Committee also examined the impact on Humanities A of the establishment of the School of Engineering, whose students are required to take the course. We noted that these students receive consistently lower grades than the College students and we assumed that this reflected their different aptitudes and interests. This discrepancy, however, makes it all the more desirable that the Engineering students should be enrolled in our regular sections."" Concerning Humanities FBI, the report said that ""the heart of . . . our criticism concerned the 'naive' approach to works o_f art. ... It is not enough . . . for students to look at pictures or sculptures and to have their teacher solicit their untutored, affective judgments."" The committee recommended ""the introduction of more penetrating and informative readings,"" a reevaluation of the present choice of works and of the chronological approach, the establishment of guided visits by classes to local museums as ""an integral part of the course,"" and the limiting of instructors to ""no more than two sections of the course concurrently."""
145,Humanities A Staff Need Not Accept Faculty Proposals,9 January 1964,"The Columbia College faculty has forwarded several recommendations to the Humanities A staff which, if accepted, would make major changes in the basic fresh-man-year course. The proposals suggest possible ways of strengthening the Humanities A course through use of occasional large lectures, critical essays, and special sections for students who already have read most of the works used in the course. Dean David B. Truman explained Tuesday that the Humanities staff is under no compulsion to accept the recommendations. Instead, they are offered for the staff's consideration without any implication of approval by the faculty. The recommendations were presented to the faculty in December by the Committee on Instruction which had acted upon a report submitted by a special Committee on the Humanities chaired by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern. The faculty recommended that the Humanities staff: • ""Arrange a small number of lectures during the semester in such a way that all sections meeting at the same hour"" could occasionally hear an instructor ""especially competent on the particular subject."" • Select ""in each semester two books [to] receive more intensive and extensive examination. This would be accomplished in part by adding . . . one or two critical essays or other ancillary works . . . and by giving one or two more hours to the work and the secondary materials so chosen. It is expected that as a consequence. . . one work will have to be dropped each semester."" • ""Collect one or two volumes of critical readings with an eye to publication so that for every work on the Humanities reading list there should be available at least one critical essay."" These would be drawn from existing literature or commissioned ""from the best possible talents."" • Consider ""establishing one or two sections on an experimental basis for students who have already read a large proportion of the readings and that these sections deal more intensively with a selection of the works."" The Stern Committee had rejected this last recommendation but it was included by the Committee on Instruction. The Committee on the Humanities sent its own recommendations to Dean Truman in a 28-page report. It emphasized that the pro-posals ""are designed to strengthen already strong courses"" and are to oe considered experimental. The report also recommended improvements in the reading lists in the Humanities B courses, Fine Arts and Music. These readings would be aimed at providing background in critical methods and greater historical and cultural context for works studied. The faculty also recommended for consideration: • ""That the Dean and the Chairman of Humanities and C.C. collaborate in an effort to increase the proportion of senior men in each staff."" • ""That the Dean . . . explore the feasibility of arranging for instructors teaching Humanities A for the first time to be permitted to count one section of that course as two-thirds of their normal teaching load."" If approved, the same provision would also apply to C.C. A.David B. Truman"
146,Letters to the Editor Wary on Humanities Report,13 January 1964,"Wary on Humanities ReportTo the Editor: It is perhaps time that the discussion about the '■ Lumanities A course be brought into the open, since it is the Columbia students who will be most affected by whatever changes—of detail or of general conception — are eventually adopted. The Humanities A staff has not yet had the time to discuss the Committee's recommendations extensively. Such discussions are planned for the Spring Semester. Thus, no consensus of the staff exists as yet. However, it can be said that almost all of us feel uneasy about the report, precisely because we doubt that its recommendations would strengthen v course whose essential virtue is the direct confrontation and intellectual involvement of the student with crucial works of the western tradition whose relevance to contemporary life and thought is the reason for their presence in the course. Peter Haidu Instructor in French and Humanities Jan. 9, 1964"
147,Student Poll Shows Split On Hum. A Some Faculty Proposals Approved in Survey,10 February 1964,"Some Faculty Proposals Approved in SurveyBy Michael T. GenglerStudent opinion expressed last spring on the first year humanities course favored the inclusion of a weekly lecture hour, but opposed the use of secondary readings in the course. The lecture hour and the use of secondary readings were among recommendations made by a special Committee on the Humanities, chaired by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern. The recommendations were presented to the faculty in December by the Committee on Instruction. The four main suggestions of the committee were: the use of lectures by an instructor ""especially competent in the particular subject""; intensive study of two books each semester, accompanied by secondary materials, with the understanding that one work will be dropped from the course each term; the use of a collection of critical essays such that each work would be covered by an essay; and the establishment of special sections for students who had previously read many of the works covered in the course. In March of 1963 the Stern committee surveyed humanities students' opinions on the value of such measures, as well as opinions on some other matters. Fifty-five per cent of the students polled said they would like to .have a one-hour general lecture each week instead of one hour of class time. One-fifth of the students were strongly opposed to such a lecture, however. At present, the predominant method of teaching Humanities A seems to be class discussion. In only three of the 37 sections did a majority of students consider that a lecture method was usually used. Although the committee recommended the use of secondary readings on the works studied in Humanities A, the students themselves opposed such readings. Fifty-six per cent attached little value to the inclusion of historicaland biographical readings in place of some of' the original works. Only forty-three per cent thought that critical essays would be of some value. Thirty-eight per cent of the students thought that interpretations of modern scholars were given sufficient attention at pres-ent. But only one-fourth of the students believed their instructors lacked the background to deal satisfactorily with the material more often than ""once cr twice."" The committee did not ask students whether thej* favored more intensive study of one or two works, or whether they thought special sections should be set up for students already familiar with many of the works. Only two-and-a-half per cent considered the reading load too light, but forty per cent thought that the assignments were ""somewhat too heavy."" Forty-nine per cent considered the load ""about right."" The committee did not recommend any change in the reading load."
148,The Humanities Report,10 February 1964,"The most evident fact about Humanities A, the freshman course in masterpieces of European literature and philosophy, is that for a quarter of a century it has been enormously successful and influential. For that reason, the recommendations of the Dean's Committee on the Humanities Courses are especially significant. In particular, the committee's attitude toward the function of Humanities deserves discussion. Adding to Tradition The traditional point of view on Humanities A was well expressed in a recent letter to this newspaper. The essential virtue of the course, an instructor wrote, ""is the direct confrontation and intellectual involvement of the student with crucial works of the western tradition whose relevance to contemporary life and thought is the reason for their presence in the course."" To this virtue, the committee chaired by Prof. Fritz Stern adds another. ""The function of an academic education,"" its report declares, ""is to go beyond this [direct experience] and to introduce the student to the scholarly and critical responses to these books that would further enlighten and deepen his private experience."" Thus the Stern Committee finds two virtues in its most controversial suggestion— that two books each semester be studied more intensively and extensively through the use of ""critical essays or other ancillary works."" It sees an advantage in learning from the secondary readings themselves and it also finds a good in the enhancement of the primary works by the critical questioning that would be stimulated. We think the Stern Committee is justified in seeking more intellectual rigor, in adding another aim to the traditional one. But we believe it essential that the interrelation of aims be kept clear, and that the traditional one be kept primary. Mark Hopkins and the Log Direct experience, of course, never exists in pure form at Columbia or any other college. It might be achieved by giving a student a volume of Plato or Milton and setting him on a log in the country. But once Mark Hopkins is added at the other end of the log, pure experience yields to something more complex—a college education. When direct confrontation is enhanced— by a teacher, a class discussion or a student's paper—it is important to keep clear the status of the primary work. In the case of discussion and papers, the distinction is emphasized by the nature of the methods. The original book is part of a tradition of written discourse. The discussion, or the paper, whichis ideally a private discussion between student and teacher, is in a different tradition — that of oral discourse. The traditions become confused, however, when critical readings are introduced. The student's natural tendency to learn what to think from secondary sources, rather than how to think, is reinforced. Fortunately, the Stern Committee rejected a proposal that critical works accompany three-quarters of the primary readings. This would have been disastrous. Still, the use by a whole class together of any secondary reading tends to be harmful. Models and Creativity Instead, we propose that students read in critical works on the books they individually choose to write about in papers. This would enhance the value of a critical essay as a model of discourse, since the student would be creating his own discourse on the same work. At the same time, it would prevent the student from adopting someone else's view in a superficial way. Another of the Stern Committee's curricular proposals also seems satisfactory. This suggests that the sections meeting at one hour occasionally get together to hear a lecture by an instructor particularly competent on a subject. Since this ""model of discourse"" would be both oral and occasional, it would provide an interesting supplement to the course, without detracting from its purposes. At the New Frontiers The question of special sections also deserves comment. Contrary to the view of the Stern Committee, the Committee on Instruction asked the Humanities A staff to ""consider establishing one or two sections on an experimental basis for students who have already read a large proportion of the readings and that these sections deal more intensively with a selection of the works."" We agree with the Committee on Instruction. Although students who have read many of the books may not have read them well, an experimental section could present them with a challenge beyond that of the ordinary class. In addition, new approaches to Humanities A might be developed in these experiments to meet future improvements in preparation before they occur. The experimental sections, however, should be carefully watched to prevent deviation from the purposes of the course. It is this allegiance to the principal purpose of Humanities A—""direct confrontation and intellectual involvement""—that we think must be kept in mind. The Stern Committee's recommendations could add intellectual rigor. If implemented judiciously, they could also preserve and enhance the student's experience with great books.

149,Humanities A Staff Favors Experimenting Opinions Vary on Report By Stern Committee,11 February 1964,"Opinions Vary on Report By Stern CommitteeBy John S. FriedmanHumanities A staff members.. yesterday stated that they favored experimentation in the course, but opinions varied widely on the suggestions made in December by the Stern Committee on the Humanities. The four principal suggestions of the committee called for the use of critical writings; a lecture hour 'with an instructor ""especially competent in the particular subject;"" intensive study of two books; and special sections for students who had previously read many of the works in the course. The staff particularly took exeption to the use of critical orks to supplement reading in the course. They felt that such~ —orks would detract from the - Lect confrontation of the student Tth the original book. One staff member stated that the use of secondary material in lass would weaken the ""hard thinking*' of the students. Many felt, however, that critical works could be used by students working on papers. The staff was generally favorable to an intensive examination of one or two works each semester, though one foresaw ""practical difficulties"" in selecting the works. Extra class meetings were also viewed by the staff as far more beneficial than a lecture by an instructor on a particular work. There were also sentiments expressed in favor of having more senior faculty members teaching he freshman course. The suggestions of the Stern Committee were presented to the faculty in December by the Committee on Instruction. The recommendations were forwarded to the Humanities A faculty for its ""consideration."" The staff was under no compulsion to accept any of the suggested changes. Howard N. Porter, chairman of the Humanities A staff, stated yesterday that the staff will make the final decision on the recommendations. He said that above all, ""we never want Humanities to become another Contemporary Civilization."" Professor Porter added that the course must always remain ""an emancipation from the trivial.""Howard N. Porto-, chairman of the Humanities Department, who .said yesterday that the Humanities sequence must never ""become another Contemporary Civilization."""
150,Staffing Humanities,11 February 1964,"The Stern Committee's recommendations on staffing Humanities A are far less controversial, but no less important, than its suggestions on curriculum. ""Ultimately,"" the committee observes, ""the success of Humanities depends upon the teachers assigned by the departments; the departments could wittingly or unwittingly condemn the course to gradual attrition."" If the committee's words seem too strong, remember the case of Contemporary Civilization B. The old C.C. B course, ""Man in Contemporary Society,"" was dropped as a requirement three years ago. The present system of choosing among courses that are too often departmental in nature was substituted. At that time, there were cries that C.C. B covered too many technical disciplines for any professor to handle. There were sage commentaries on the further fragmentation of our two or three cultures. But within the faculty was a more disquieting answer. There were people who could teach C.C. B, many thought; but there were just too few who were interested enough in doing so. Fortunately, Humanities A is not on the edge of disaster. But its position is hardly safe. In fact, the situation is only encouraging in comparison with C.C. A. Consider the following list of the number of persons from each rank of faculty who are listed as teaching the two courses this year. Humanities C.C. Professors 1 2 Associate Professors 6 1 Assistant Professors 10 5 Instructors 19 13 Preceptors 3 4 Associates 1 5 Lecturers 0 3 TOTAL 40 33 The conclusion is obvious. There are too few senior men teaching Humanities, and even fewer teaching C.C. The core of experience and leadership among the staff is too thin for comfort. Thus the Stern Committee's recommendations in this area are vital and timely. The committee calls for closer coordination between the general education program and the departments which provide the instructors. It asks for the reward, through fellowships and other means, of those who teach the courses. It urges that the number of preceptors in Humanities be minimized. To the Stern Committee's specific proposals in these areas, the Committee on Instruction has added another. It asks that the Dean study whether instructors teaching Humanities and C.C. for the first time should be permitted to count their section as twothirds of the normal teaching load. The idea is to give inexperienced instructors the time to prepare throughly. In 1957, the President's Committee on the Educational Future of the University surveyed the staff problem and concluded that ""urgent remedial measures"" were needed. The problem, as the figures painfully demonstrates, has not diminshed. The recommenda-tions on staffing of the Stern Committee, therefore, are both urgent—and wise. They can do much to assist young instructors, and to stimulate the interest among senior professors to teach the general education courses that well deserve their time. (This editorial is the second of three on the report of the Dean's Committee on the Humanities Courses in Columbia College.)"
151,Livelier Arts,12 February 1964,"The Humanities B courses—art and music —may seem very different in content from Humanities A. Yet in the view of the Stern Committee, similar principles underlie similar recommendations. The principles are that more intellectual precision and discipline are needed, and that ""models of discourse"" are desirable. The principal suggestion is for more and better readings. We think both the principles and recommendations are sound, even more clearly so than in Humanities A. Art and music, after all, are ""foreign languages"" to many students. Without a rigorous approach, involving the development of a scholarly and critical attitude, they tend to remain so. ""The student,"" as the Stern Committee says, ""must be given sufficient guidance so that he can move towards a disciplined vision of a work of art."" In the case of both the art and music courses, the committee has concluded, and the staffs have agreed, that superior readings would enhance the understanding of the works studied and also of the principles embodied in them. In each case, it was also found that no existing book could properly perform these functions. For art humanities, the staff will develop a volume with essays that illuminate historical and cultural contexts, and also serve as models of analysis. In music, an analagous collection of readings will be created. As in Humanities A, there is always the possibility that the student will copy his model of discourse rather than learn from it. In Humanities B, however, the risks are small compared with the potential gain. Too many students have no idea at all of how to respond to or understand a work of art. Better readings can help the instructor give them that knowledge. One other recommendation, with regard to art humanities, strikes us as particularly good. It asks that guided visits to museums be an integral part of the course. With New York's abundant artistic resources, it has always seemed strange that discussion between teacher and student should take place only in front of slides of varying quality. The music humanities staff might also consider further ways of exploring New York's artistic resources. The rich program of concerts in the city, in particular, might be used more extensively. The acceptance of the proposals on Humanities B by the respective staffs is promising. The Stern Committee's recommendations will help improve two courses that are worthwhile in their purposes, but could be better in some of their practices. (This editorial is the last of three on the report of the Dean's Committee on the Humanities Courses in Columbia College.)"
152,Correction,12 February 1964,It was erroneously reported in yesterday's Spectator that the Stern Committee on the Humanities favored special Humanities A sections for students who have already read many of the works in the course. The committee has opposed this suggestion.
153,"Truman Outlines Steps To Help Liberal Arts General Education, History of Science, Seminars Cited as Areas Which Strengthen Program",14 February 1964,"General Education, History of Science, Seminars Cited as Areas Which Strengthen ProgramBy Alan J. WillenDean David B. Truman yesterday outlined three areas in which Columbia can keep the liberal-arts college alive at a time when some are predicting its death.The three areas are general education, history of science, and seminars and colloquia. Dean Truman expanded on his Charter-Day speech which criticized the views expressed by Dean of Faculties Jacques Barzun in a speech at Hofstra University Dec. 11. Dean Barzun had asserted that the liberal arts education would decline in light of improved curricula in the secondary schools and the increasing pressures of graduate education upon the colleges. In the area of general education, Dean Truman explained yesterday, Columbia should build on the preparation of students who enter with advanced placement. Such a program would deal in greater depth with the same range of subjects currently covered. The experimental sections of Humanities A for students with advanced preparation proposed by the Committee on Instruction in light of the Humanities Report are one method by which the College could move toward such a goal, he pointed out. The Stern Committee rejected this proposal because it felt that these sections would monopolize the best talent in each class. However, the Committee on Instruction's proposal would be limited to twenty to forty students in one or two sections, still leaving, Dean Truman feels, a large number of first-rate students for the rest of the sections. In the second area, the history of science, the Dean noted that a committee is currently examining the introduction of the subject on the undergraduate level and seek-ing a full-time instructor in the field. The committee, consisting of Dean Truman, Professor of Physics Samuel Devons, Professor of History Henry Graff, and John Dewey Professor of Philosophy Ernest Nagel, feels that initially such a program would consist only of onegeneral course, open as an elective to sophomores and above. Dean Truman's final suggestion was the greater development of inter-disciplinary courses on a seminar or colloquium level, broadening the approach to a subject by examining it from more than one point of view. He pointed to the seminar in English and sociology entitled ""Studies in Literature and Society"" given by Professor of Sociology Daniel Bell and Associate Professor of English Steven Marcus as an example of this approach. ""Some faculty members have shown interest in this area,"" the Dean stated, ""and a wide range of possibilities has been explored."""
154,Signs of Life,21 February 1964,"Dean Barzun's funeral oration for the liberal arts college is rapidly acquiring as much fame as the speech of Pericles for the dead soldiers of Athens. The latest development is The American Scholar's decision to publish the text in its next issue. Meanwhile, back at one of these ""dying"" colleges, there are some healthy stirrings of life. Dean Truman pointed last week to three areas in which the liberal arts have a collegiate future —general education, history of science and interdepartmental seminars and colloquia. Underlying these possibilities is the idea that liberal education is not merely an exposure to a cultural heritage, or even the combination of detailed study of one field with casual acquaintance of all the others. It is rather a continuing effort to understand human experience from a larger perspective. In Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, this attempt involves a deliberate disregard for the conventional demarcations of the academic world. In history of science or interdepartmental courses, there is instead the goal of relating knowledge of several disciplines to a common problem. In all, however, there is another necessity which is only sometimes explicitly stated. This is a commitment by teachers to the purposes of liberal education, one strong enough to make them devote the great energy necessary for successful courses. Experimental sections in Humanities A, for example, depend heavily on the individual instructors who teach them. In the history of science, the College presses its search for a qualified person to initiate a course, and then a program. Interdepartmental courses, finally, ly on the close cooperation of professors in different departments. The sound ideas of Dean Truman are -;ref ore not enough to keep the liberal arts vital at Columbia College. Only a dedicated faculty can make good plans into realities. If the liberal arts decline at the College, it will be the responsibility of the faculty. If they flourish, it will be their reward."
155,Praises Truman's Efforts To Keep Area Strong,3 March 1964,"Dean of Faculties Jacques Barzun yesterday praised Dean David B. Truman's efforts to keep liberal arts education vigorous. In a recent interview Dean Truman said that an elective course in the history of science, greater development of interdisciplinary courses, and greater depth in general education courses would help Columbia maintain the importance of liberal arts education recent trends towards increased undergraduate specialization. Dean Barzun was pleased with Dean Truman's support of the revival of a program in the history of science. A program in this field once existed at Columbia, but lapsed before World War 11. As part of his efforts to stimulate revival of the program, the Provost appointed a search committee in 1960 under former Dean John G. Palfrey to look into the matter. The committee still exists, and according to the Provost "". . . With impetus from Dean Truman appears to have produced fruit."" Dean Barzun explained that he supported the history of science program because it provides for a desirable understanding of sci-ence-in-society which "". . . no one has time to provide in the teaching of science."" The Provost termed the interdepartmental courses supported by Dean Truman ""an excellent antidote for specialization, provided each course is more than a juxtaposition of two disciplines."" He explained that ""the principle of inter-departmental offerings is no better than its application,"" and said that success depends on personalities of students and teachers. The chances of success are great, however, because "". . . inter-departmental course offerings usually come from a desire to team up."" He cited Colloquiumand several joint seminars as examples of successful team work. Dean Barzun added a note of caution to his comments, however, when discussing the Stern Committee's recent report on Humanities. The Committee has proposed that secondary readings and special lectures be introduceed in Humanities A. ""I've never been very much in favor of secondary material, especially if it takes the form of periodic lectures by so-called experts in the field,"" he said. Dean Barzun supported the use of essays, but only those of a general sort. Minute, textual studies of a work should not be used in Humanities, he said."
156,"Propose Unproctored Finals for CC, Hum. Request by Academic Integrity Commission To Be Presented to Instructors by Dean",11 March 1964,"Request by Academic Integrity Commission To Be Presented to Instructors by DeanUnproctored final examinations in Contemporary Civilization A and Humanities A have been proposed by the Commission on Academic Integrity. The request was made to the Dean's Office and to the Com-mittee on Instruction. Mid-terms in the two first-year courses will be unproctored, as they were last term, subject to the discretion of the individual instructor, Donald Mintz '64, chairman of the Commission, said yesterday. Most of the instructors participated in the experiment last term, he noted. Dean David B. Truman will present the proposal to the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities instructors to ascertain their position on the unproctored finals. Robert K. Webb, associate professor of history and chairman of the Contemporary Civilization Department, said he favored unproctored finals because ""that is the way it was when I was a student at Oberlin."" Mintz also indicated that Associate Professor of Greek and Latin Howard N. Porter, head of the Humanities department, would tell his instructors that they need not insist on proctoring quizzes. The instructor, however, would have to remain in the room to hand out quizzes to latecomers. An instructor, thus, would be present for most of the ten-minute quiz. The aim of all unproctored exams is to make those taking the test ""more at ease,"" Mintz explained. He said that the Commission on Academic Integrity would be made permanent. The student group had originally been created for one year by the dean's office and the Student Advisory Committee. Mintz expects a statement from the faculty this year on their position on the question of an honor system at Columbia and on the work which the commission has done."
157,Stern Will Discuss Humanities Course,11 March 1964,"Associate Professor of History Fritz R. Stern will give a fireside chat tonight at 9:15 p.m. He will speak on ""The Future of the Humanities Course At the College."" Professor Stern was chairman of the committee which recently suggested several changes in the Humanities A course. The committee suggested that two books each semester ""receive more intensive and extensive examination"" through the use of secondary readings. It also recommended that a lecture be occasionally substituted for a regular class discussion, and that one or two volumes of critical essays be prepared. These suggestions are currently being considered by the Humanities A staff."

Porter, chairman of the program. The Committee proposedmajor changes in the basic fresh-man-year course. Professor Porter also announced that Robert L. Belknap, associate professor of Russian language and literature, will chair the program beginning next September. Professor Belknap was acting chairman for one semester last year. The staff rejected the proposals to introduce occasional lectures to large groups of students by an expert on a particular topic and to introduce critical background essays. It accepted the recommendation to examine two books more intensively than others. The staff also decided to drop the works by Herodotus, Lucretius and Aristophanes from the reading list. A fourth proposal, to establish special sections for students who already have read most of the works used in the course, is still being considered by the staff. An official report on the Humanities staff's reaction to the recommendations will be prepared by Professor Porter in April, after the Humanities faculty votes on the special section proposal. The re-port will then be submitted to the Committee on Instruction. The recommendations were presented to the College faculty by the Committee on Instruction which had acted upon a report prepared by the committee chaired by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern. Professor Belknap will lead the discussion on the issue of special sections at the weekly luncheon of the Humanities staff April 7. At that time he will have tabulated results of students' replies to a questionnaire distributed in all Humanities A sections last week. The questionnaire asked for students' previous acquaintance with the works presented in the sequence and their evaluation of the teaching method in their section, class discussions, and theiropinion on the need for critical essays and general lectures to be given during class time. • ""Arrange a small number of lectures ... in such a way that all sections meeting at the same hour"" could occasionally hear an instructor ""especially competent on the particular subject."" • ""Select in each semester two books [to] receive more intensiveand extensive examination. This would be accomplished in part by adding . . . one or two critical essays or other ancillary works . . . and by giving one or two more hours to the work and the secondary materials so chosen. It is expected that as a consequence . . . one work will have to be dropped each semester."" • ""Collect one or two volumes of critical readings ... so that for every work on the Humanities reading list there should be available at least one critical essay."" • Consider ""establishing one ortwo sections on an experimental basis for students who. have already read a large proportion of the readings.""

159,A Time to Help,8 April 1964,"The Student Educational Exchange Roundtable program of the Citizenship Council was begun in Little Rock, Ark., last summer on the initiative of four Columbia College students. The SEER program of book discussion in small groups is directed to talented but culturally deprived high school students. Its success last summer has led to a broad extension of the program, the success of which depends solely on the participation of Columbia students. The Citizenship Council has sent letters to all College students who reside in the 25 cities now included in the SEER program, requesting their participation. The Columbiastudents would meet with several high school students twice a week for six weeks and would guide discussion of a reading list that combines parts of Humanities A, CC A, and Lionel Trilling's course on modern writers. Discussion outlines, written by faculty members, are being prepared to aid the discussion leader. In a day when violence breaks out daily over the problems of poverty and racial conflict, an opportunity for Columbia students to help alleviate these social ills through personal and intellectual contact should not be turned down. We urge all students who can to enlighten both themselves and others by taking part in the SEER program."
160,Special Class In Humanities Not Approved Proposal for Advanced Sections Is Rejected,9 April 1964,"Proposal for Advanced Sections Is RejectedSpecial first year Humanities sections for students who have studied most of the works used in the course will not be offered in the autumn term next year, according to Associate Professor of Greek and Latin Howard N. Porter, chairman of Humanities A. Special sections were discussed but termed ""undesirable"" by the Stern Committee on the Humanities. The Committee on Instruction, however, asked the Humanities staff to consider establishing the special sections in its report on the findings of the Stern Committee in December. Professor Porter said the decision not to offer special sections this fall does not mean such sections will not be offered in the future. He said the Humanities staff believed that there will be so much experimentation in the basic structure of the course this fall that further experimentation should be postponed. He did not rule out the possibility that special sections may be offered in the spring term. The staff decision to reject the Stern Committee proposal for weekly lectures to Humanities classes by instructors ""particularly competent"" in a special area was not affected by the existence of lectures on Humanities A sponsored by the Board of Managers, according to Professor Porter. He said the staff ""approved unreservedly"" of that series, but did not feel it was a part of the course. Professor Porter said that if the Board of Managers decided to drop the lectures, the Humanities Department would probably want to offer similar optional lectures. The Committee on the Humanities, chaired by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern, also recommended the use of critical essays on the works in the course as secondary material. This suggestion was not approved by the Humanities staff. Also included in the committee's report were recommended changes in ths Humanities B courses, Fine Arts and Music."
161,Change in Humanities,9 April 1964,"The decisions made recently by the Humanities A staff regarding changes in the basic freshman course will help to maintain the traditionally high quality of this offering. The action of the staff was based mainly on a report from the Committee on Instruction, which had reviewed the Stern Committee report on the Humanities. The Stern report itself was also considered by the staff. Although not all the recommendations presented to them were of equal value, we believe that the teachers of the course have in general acted wisely in making plans for aext year. Two suggestions of the Stern Committee have been rejected by the staff—a proposal to add critical background readings to the course and a plan for occasional lectures by experts on particular authors, to be given to all sections meeting at a given hour. Critical works, although valuable in themselves, would- not have been in accord with the main purpose of the course. We believe that Humanities A is one place where as little peripheral material as possible should be allowed to interfere with direct confrontation of the student with the book he is reading. And because of the already large volume of reading, critical studies could be ""added only at the expense of the more basic works already in the course. The occasional lectures, however, would be of value. They would serve as a take-off point for class discussion without having the diluting effect of critical works. Optional lectures are now available under the sponsorship of the Board of Managers. As the chairman of the Humanities program has noted, these lectures are a worthwhile feature outside of the course. Making similar lectures a part of Humanities A would only make them more valuable. Both students and teachers would have the advantage of a presentation by an expert, and all but a few hours of class time would still be available .for discussion in smaller groups. The staff agreed to give intensive treatment to two works already on the Humanities reading list. This recommendation of the Stern Committee is well worth an experiment, because it will help to compensate for the rapid pace of the course and the vast amount of material covered. However, this intensification has unfortunately made it necessary to shorten the reading list. Elimination of works by Herodotus, Aristophanes and Lucretius shows that there is a danger in traveling too far in the direction of intensification. These works added both humor and variety to a course which now gives a much less complete indication of the ideas of the ancients. An ide""a discussed but rejected by the Stern Committee, that of special sections for students who have already read most of the works in Humanities A, was suggested for the consideration of the staff by the Committee on Instruction. In postponing any experiment in this area because of otherchanges which will take place this fall, the staff has shown caution in dealing with a proposal which does not seem essential immediately. High school preparation has not yet advanced to the point where Humanities A is a waste of time for more than a handful of freshmen, if any. But experimentation with special sections in the future could be helpful for a time when further changes in the course will be called for. In sum, Humanities A can best be improved by the initiative, tempered with a sense of caution, which the staff of the course has shown."
162,"Unproctored Tests Planned In Hum., CC Each Instructor Will Set Own Exam Procedure",13 April 1964,"Each Instructor Will Set Own Exam ProcedureBy Alan S. LakeUnproctored final examinations in Contemporary Civilization A and Humanities A, to be held at the discretion of individual instructors, have been approved by the Committee on Instruction and the Dean's Office. Although some details are still being worked out, the examinations will be held in classrooms instead of in the gymnasium, and may be given unproctored upon approval of the instructor in each class, Assistant Dean Robert C. Pinckert said Friday. No provision for a reporting system is planned. Dean Pinckert commented that having unproctored finals was the next logical step after the success of the unproctored mid-terms which were held this year in GCA and Humanities A. The Academic Integrity Commission is proposing that the students in each class be allowed to vote on whether or not to have an unproctored final if their instructor has already approved, according to Laurance Guido '65, secretary of the commission. If two-thirds of the students in the class do not vote in favor of the unproctored examination, it is possible that the class will take its final in the gymnasium in the usual manner. Associate Professor of Greek and Latin Howard N. Porter, chairman of the Humanities department, commented that he did not think cheating will be a major problem under the plan. ""As far as Humanities is concerned,"" he said, ""the problem is one of students turning in papers which are not all theirs rather than one of cheating on examinations."" He added, ""I think the honor system will probably be a good thing."""
163,ESOTERICA King's Crown Essays,16 April 1964,"King's Crown EssaysBy Richard FreedmanMr. Freedman is an instructor in the English Department. I rejoice to concur with the common reader; for by the common sense of readers, uncorrupted by literary prejudices, after all the refinements of subtlety and the dogmatism of learning, must be generally decided all claim to poetical honours. . . . Dr. Johnson That common reader in whose critical judgment writers from Dr. Johnson to Virginia Woolf placed their faith has become a victim to an age of specialization. One publication which distinctly ignores him is King's Crown Essays, which appeared this week after a year's hiatus. While the common reader as Dr. Johnson conceived of him should presumably be interested in such diverse subjects as Pound's poetry, semantics, and the use of cavalry in medieval warfare, he is not likely to find the treatment of these subjects here entombed much to his taste. The philistine hoots and jeers which greet each new issue of King's Crown Essays are in some measure justified. The journal consists of term papers written for specific course assignments, and while the papers in this issue are of uniformly high scholarly quality, their publication is likely to bring unmixed delight only to the writers and their immediate families. For the undergraduate writers all too successfully ape the worst pedantic mannerisms of their betters and the result is a scholarly magazine of such thumping humorlessness, turgidity and pedantry as to dismay even the editor of PMLA. Cliches (""The origin of her worship was shrouded in mystery""), fatuities (""Praxitiles, one of antiquity's most gifted sculptors""), archness (""Will"" James for Hank's philosopher brother), and pretentious comma faults (in Robert Finkel's C. Wright Mills' Award-winning study of ""La Vita Nuova"") abound. If the uncommon reader has the patience to wade through all this he will be ultimately rewarded by intelligent criticism and impressive scholarship. Ronald Padgett makes out a good case for reading a difficult Pound poem without benefit of secondary sources, and Michael Friedman is illuminating about the vexed issue of what Plato meant by ""Art""—an issue which should be of interest to veterans of Humanities A. Gary Shapiro intelligently examines images of transience and evanescence in several No plays (the literary bias of the magazine seems generally New Critical), and Craig Karpel displays appalling erudition about the problems of horsemanship in the middle ages. But in the latter article we find the statement, made in all seriousness, that ""the dating of the contents of early-medieval Germanic horse-burials is itself a highly controversial subject."" This borders dangerously on the Benchleyesque. The catchy, Times Magazine Section title, ""Pygmalion's Fair Lady"" by Allen Koenigsberg is grossly inappropriate to an article seven and a half pages long with 24 footnotes, six of which refer to translations from the Latin by the author. Former President Eisenhower once admonished us not to join the ranks of the book burners. In its lack of grace and its sovereign disregard for the common reader King's Crown Essays seriously tempts us to ignore that uncharacteristically sage and humane advice."
164,Princeton Admissions Hoax Aided by Columbia Student,21 April 1964,"By Stephen SteinerIf Charles Lieppe '66 ever seeks to avoid a bill collector, evade the draft, or travel incognito, he can adopt the alias Joseph D. Oznot and be assured of success in his endeavors. The alias works especially well in Princeton, New Jersey. Lieppe agreed to help some daring Princeton students get an imaginary high school senior accepted as a member of the Princeton Class of '68. He became Joseph D. Oznot, the ""tweedy"" son of a Michigan private detective, and posing as Oznot was interviewed by an admissions committee member. As any private detective worth his weight in bullets would realize, Joseph D. Oznot is the equivalent of Joseph Does Not (exist). But the Princeton admissions committeedid not know this, and so young Joseph was accepted. The conspirators made Oznot into an amazing, but composite individual. He was as bright as the Princeton students who took his College boards. He was a lacrosse player, because Lieppe was a lacrosse player. He played the piano, because Lieppe played the piano. He was well acquainted with great literature, because Lieppe had taken Humanities A as a freshman. Lieppe, who told nobody but his mother about the hoax, did not think he would get into trouble because ""after all, I don't go to Princeton. H the Princeton fellows were willing to take the risk, why shouldn't I?"" When Lieppe was a high school senior, he legitimately applied to Princeton. He was rejected."
165,Sees Clause For Reporting As Necessary Dean's Office in Favor Of Honor Experiment,1 May 1964,"Dean's Office in Favor Of Honor ExperimentBy Stephen Steiner""Some kind of reporting clause"" would probably be ""necessary in the long run"" for the proposed honor system at Columbia College, according to Associate Dean John W. Alexander. Dean Alexander has taught at the University of North Carolina which has an honor system and finds a reporting clause ""to be a necessity."" He said, however, that it would not be appropriate for him and Dean Truman to say ""what we approve of."" Dean Alexander believes that the reporting clause would be more severly enforced if students were to report cheating to a student commission rather than to the instructor. ""Student committees tend to be more severe than faculty committees,"" he said. The honor system is still in the ""experimental stage"" according to Dean Alexander. The Dean's Office is working with the Academic Integrity Committee in the experiment, which began in November when CC A and Humanities A midterms were unproctored. Finals in these courses will also be given under the honor system, but a reporting clause will not be included. Dean Alexander stated Wednesday that the Dean's office favors the experiment and ""we're moving ahead on the plan as quickly as we can."" He feels that its next extension might be to include science courses ""where the exams are more objective."" Mr. Alexander noted, however, that ""it is possible for a man to get help on CC and Humanities exams, too. Cheating is possible on any exam."" Attempts to expand the honor system must be accepted by the faculty; the students will also be given a chance to express their opinions. ""We are doing this democratically,"" he said. ""Dean Truman has no intention of acting without faculty approval."" Students in CC and Humanities classes recently were given an option of taking the exam under the honor system. According to afaculty member, most of Ms sin- '. dents were opposed to taking the final exam under Use honor sys-j tern until they learned thai they would otherwise have to take Hie j exam in the gym. Then the class' voted overwhelmingly in favor of! the honor system. Instructors who do not wish to i have their classes use the honor: system will have to proctor the! examinations themselves.John W.

166,Porter Sees Senior Staff Drop in Hum. Cites Primary Obligation To Own Departments,11 May 1964,"Cites Primary Obligation To Own DepartmentsBy Jeremy EpsteinAssociate Professor of Greek and Latin Howard N. Porter, chairman of the Humanities A staff, said yesterday that he anticipated a decline in the number of senior faculty members that would be teaching the first year Humanities sequence next year. The report of the Stern Committee on the Humanities issued in January had urged that ""the balance between senior and junior instructors . . . must be redressed in favor of the former."" According to Professor Porter, although many senior faculty members have expressed a desire to teach the course, their primary obligations are to their individual departments. As faculty members move up in the academic hierarchy, Professor Porter observed, they are required by their departments to teach advanced College and Graduate Faculties courses. As a result they no longer have time to teach Humanities. Professor Porter noted that ""the academic atmosphere is not the same as it was 25 years ago."" Certain departments, he indicated, no longer show a catholic intellectual outlook and a broad interest in general education. Instead, they demand an increasingly narrow technical competence of their faculty members. He cited the departments of Philosophy and Greek and Latin as examples of departments whose emphasis on specialization has diminished their contribution to the Humanities course. Commenting on a recommendation by the Committee on Instruction, Professor Porter endorsed the proposal that instructors teaching Humanities or Contemporary Civilization for the first time be allowed to count one section of either course as two-thirds of their normal teaching load. He said, however, that the Humanities staff was not empowered to approve this measure because it involved an increase in expenditure. He said that he had received no indication that the recommendation had been passed by the proper budgetary committees, and that he doubted it would be."
167,"A JUSTIFICATION $12,000 Later",1 June 1964,"$12,000 LaterBy Arthur J. GrebowDear Dad, You've been asking me for four years how I spent your $12,000 and I've been avoiding you and making up stories and just not talking. Well, now that it's all over I've decided to come clean. So please listen carefully because it's a long story and I don't want to repeat myself. You probably don't remember that first day when we walked into the quad and an upperclassman tried to put a blue beanie on my head and I tried to pull the silly thing off. But, I remember it and I also remember the awkward freshman who registered for Freshman Week that day and the hopes he had that college would be the most satisfying years of his life. Well, they probably were, and the reason for this is that Columbia offered me not only an intellectual experience, but also the chance to develop into some type of civilized person. Whether you are willing to admit it or not, the person that walked through the Hartley Hall alley on that day bears little resemblance to the person you see in the cap and gown today. He's changed more during this time than in any four years of his life. This, I think, is the true value of a Columbia education. When I first started Columbia and knew that I'd have to commute for a year or so, I decided that the best way to become more attached to college would be to transform myself into an athlete. And what better way to become a real man than to ""gut it out"" on the heavyweight crew. So there I was, the next to worst punchball player in Washington Heights, pulling on an oar in a forty degree downpour on the muddy Harlem River. This lasted a couple of months until you reminded me that coming home at seven o'clock and falling asleep two hours later over Hegel was not the best way to pass midterms. For about the only time in my life I listened to you and finally retired my oar, after being moved to tears by Coach Ullrich's pleas about how I was losing the best thing that ever happened to any man. I could only stand about two days of walking in a groove between Hamilton Hall and the vault-like College Library when I decided that I had to do something to take my mind off studying. One day I went to the third floor of Ferris Booth Hall and right into the office that would put an end to my then-glowing hopes of graduating magna cum laude. The first thing that happened to me when I walked into the editorial office of Spectator was that I was pushed right out and told to cover an economics lecture by Professor Barger. The speech was about the depleting gold reserves in the United States and while it was all very clear to me, for some reason nobody in the office could understand what it was all about. You see I forgot to tell them that I knew nothing about economics and when I finally saw Professor Barger (who just happened to be my advisor) again he told me that if things happened the way I described we would be bankrupt in about six months. That was the start of my career on Spectator. It lasted for almost four years and officially came to an end on March 10, 1964. It was the cause of several sleepless nights, some poor grades and many sessions of endless b.s. It was also an opportunity to speak to deans, improve my writing, broaden my interests, and to assume a position of leadership. In short, it was the best activity in the college and, in spite of everything, I would probably do it all over again. During the beginning of my sophomore year I decided that it would be impossible to go through college without belonging to a fraternity. After some pondering and comparing I pledged Beta Sigma Rho. Beta Sig is no longer in existence and sometimes, during my more malevolent moments, I like to think that my depledging caused this. One night during pledge period, the Warden of the house sent us pledges (all four of us) down to Times Square to preach a newly-conceived religion.We had to stay there, he told us, until we got seven people to convert to this religion. I was embarrassed as hell and finally got out of it by finding a friend of mine in the area and getting him to sign seven different names to our list. What really made me quit though, was not this, but the realization that I simply didn't need the fraternity and didn't want to eat most of my meals with these same thirty people. I suppose I could go on like this. There are so many more things I could tell you. Like the first stag dance I went to when, at about five to twelve, this girl from the Bronx and I were the only ones left and we finally decided that we must have been meant for each other. Or the time I discovered that my room in the dorms was the only one with a private bathroom and my dorm counselor decided that the bathtub would be a perfect place to keep beer cold. Or the all-night session in the Hartley Hall Study at 5 a.m. when three panicking upperclassmen decided to turn the clock back four hours. But, by now you must be wondering if this is all I've been doing for four years. No, some of the time was spent in the classroom and, in fact, during all this time I missed less than twenty classes (even though I must have slept through half of the ones I attended). Columbia's greatness as an educational institution rests on the competence of its faculty, and during my undergraduate years I've had some of the best. Professor Stahmer gave me my first insight into that big red book called ""Sources of Contemporary Civilization."" He became my lifelong friend during that first day when, after asking each of us where we came from and what we were doing here, he said to me: ""You come from my old high school? You can leave now; you're getting an automatic A."" Mr. Park, my Humanities A (before IBM) instructor was my first mythbreaker. Even the religious leaders had no escape from his acid comments—Augustine, he said, was a homosexual and Christ had a mother-complex. And then, oneday Mr. Park turned to us with a pained expression and said: ""You know, the funny part is that I believe in this."" How can I ever forget the eloquence or drama of a Metzger lecture or the encyclopedic knowledge of a Professor Schapiro? I don't think I could leave Columbia without showing some graditude to the interest and understanding which my seminar instructor Dean Lee showed in me or the concern which Professor Sidorsky had for all his students. Well, I seem to be running out of space and I think I'm beginning to become a little sentimental and that's something which you know is definitely out of character. Those, in short, are some of the ways in which I've spent your money. Columbia changed me and I know it changed some of my friends. Despite what some graduate school admissions directors think, no man's worth can be revealed from a couple of pieces ofpaper. You and I at least know this. The major period of development has ended. Next year it will be torts and contracts on the banks of Lake Cayuga. The time to get serious begins in three months. Your other son, Arthur"
168,Ivan M. Weissman Goodbye—024633,1 June 1964,"Goodbye— 024633024633 ends its career today. The Graduate School of Journalism will offer a different Columbia identification number in the fall. The number which has been mine throughout my undergraduate years ought to be retired. 024633 has experienced so much that asking for four more years at Columbia College would be gluttonous. The day I merged with 024633 was unforgettable. Upperclassmen told freshmen the annual legends of men starving while waiting on registration lines. Disliking hunger, I arose early to beat the hordes on freshman registration day. The effort was futile because it still took three hours to ""be processed."" I emerged from the line awed at the complexity of the Columbia bureaucracy. More importantly, though, I knew that I really belonged. I had been given my own identification number. Adjusting from high school senior to 024633 was difficult. The amount of work required was absurd and New Hall was a prison. Nothing was left to believe in. My C.C. instructor could find fallacies in the arguments of men who seemed totally convincing when read in my room the night before. Professor Shenton destroyed my belief in the perfection of demigods of American history. My English instructor found so much to criticize that my papers were returned with comments longer than my composition. Being 024633 made me a man. I learned to stay up all night. I learned to stomach Ta-Kome food. I adjusted to having gym at 9 a.m. I resisted the lures of the pitchmen from fraternities. 024633 and I grew compatible. C.C. and Humanities came as revelations after a staple diet of Amsco ■Review Books and pat high school explanations. After bold experimentation with crew and lightweight football, my survival instincts prompted membership in Spectator and WKCR. 024633 soon became a worldly sophisticate among identification cards. As a broadcaster for WKCR and reporter for Spectator, I became a frequent visitor to exotic ports of call such as Providence, New Haven, and Ithaca. These road trips with Columbia teams destroyed the illusions of glamorous life at other Ivy League campuses. The parties of Cornell seemed monotonous, the values of beautiful campuses seemed transitory, and being anyplace but in New York seemed unthinkable. Suddenly I was proud to be 024633 of Columbia. 024633 and I were being molded into ""whole men."" How could we be otherwise after music and art humanities? Culturation occurred despite great obstacles. Forgiving the Metropolitan Opera for darkening the hall and making note-taking imposs-ible was difficult when a concert report was due the following morning. The list of paintings to be viewed at museums before the art exam caused a frenzied trip downtown. My colleagues vowed to look only at required paintings to avoid becoming confused. Surprisingly, most of us advanced to higher levels of dilettantism in advanced music and art courses. 024633 and I endured many academic battles. Completing the math-science requirement was an epic feat. We even earned the nickname of the ""green giant"" for performance in botany. We brought cheer into the humdrum existence of a guard while completing a fifty page paper for Professor Metzger. We camped all night in my father's downtown office to take advantage of the electric typewriter, air conditioner, and stocked refrigerator. The building watchman was delighted by our company and wanted to know if we would return to chat every evening. 024633 and I think we took the best College courses. The race to keep pace with fast-talking Professor Rothschild was lost in a course on western Europe but the course was brilliant despite an incomplete notebook. We felt compelled to record every word of the eloquent Professor Metzger in his United States in the Twentieth Century course. Humanities 3-4 was dessert after Humanities A. Our senior seminar on political leadership climaxed a stimulating experience. 024633 and I were enticed by extracurricular activities. Spectator became our child. Its demands for attention were relentless. When mistakes were made, cab trips to the plant were taken at 2 a.m. After Saturday night dates, all-night vigils to prepare Monday's paper were often necessary. We complained about the newspaper's insane demands. Somehow we always thought that it was worthwhile. 024633 and I saw a crucial change in Columbia sports during our four years. Losing was normalcy during our freshman year. A football championship in our sophomore year and the arrival of two exciting young coaches —Jack Rohan for basketball and Carl Ullrich for crew—made Columbia a winner. 024633, a child of IBM, noticed only an improvement in winning percentages. A more sentient observer could detect the greater assimilation of the athlete into the Columbia community. Winning improved campus morale. Archie Roberts became a household word. Coaches imposed stricter standards of behavior on athletes. Athletes complied because they respected their coaches.024633 and I share memories of vicarious participation in Columbia athletics. The experience of describing President Kennedy at the Harvard-Columbia football game in the WKCR broadcast and Spectator story won't be forgotten. The stories of football victory over Cornell and the basketball upset of Princeton will provide lively fodder for alumni gatherings. Some memories are more personal. The moments of interviewing Archie Roberts after Columbia lost Homecoming Game to Princeton seemed interminable when neither of us knew what to say. The pain of Mohawk Airlines nights to Ithaca will remain in my stomach. The hardiest of Columbia athletes cringed with fear at these airborne adventures. 024633, time has run out. The range of our experiences together has been vast—from discovery of the half-truths of horror stories about Barnard to inspiration by professors whose incisiveness was awesome. A wag with access to an IBM machine prepared punch cards as mock diplomas. His aim was to parody 024633. The jest is weak. Four yf ars at Columbia have been more stimulating and weighted with personal meaning than an identification to the Columbia registrar will ever indicate — 024633 of the Class of 1964."

That one Salter's doesn't sell. » * ♦ SOPHISTICATO: Come, ccme, Simplicio: why do you really believe these bourgeois misconceptions? A whole man is supposed to rid himself of such simple thoughts. SIMPLICIO: I think I am not so naive as you would make me out to be; for I too have thought much on such questions. It is my opinion that one should give credence to the beliefs of his ancestors — unless of course he has definite grounds for the contrary. And since, as we all know, no one has definite grounds for any philosophy at all, I conclude that all men should believe the beliefs of those who came before them. * * * SOPHISTICATIO: But to believe as you do is to believe blindly.

170,Humanities A Staff Says No To Any Special Sections Now,4 December 1964,"The Humanities A staff has rejected for the present a proposal to establish several special sections for students who have read many of the works in the course before entering Columbia. Dean David B. Truman said in an interview yesterday that the staff decided to ""postpone the issue without prejudice"" to see if there is a need for the special sections.which would deal with certain books more intensively than usual. A questionnaire was sent to all freshmen before this year began to find out how many books on the Humanities reading list they had read. According to Dean Truman, the results ""showed some increase in exposure"" over past entering classes, but it ""was not conclusive."" Some staff members were afraid that special sections would weaken the other sections by removing the best students. Dean Truman said that he did not think this would happen. He mentioned that the freshmen with ""largre exposure were reasonably distributed over the talent scale."" The proposal for special sections was one of the recommendations made last year by the Committee on the Humanities, chaired by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern. A report from the Humanities staff concerning its reaction to the Stern Commitee recommendations was sent to the College Committee on Instruction last month.One of these proposals was approved by the staff and is now in effect on an experimental basis. It called for selection of one book each semester to receive more intensive and extensive examination, including the use of secondary critical material. This year instructors have been requested to spend the period from Nov. 4 to Dec. 4 on Euripedes, Plato or Thucydides. The choice of works for next semester has not yet been determined, Dean Truman said. The Humanities staff also rejected a proposal to arrange a few lectures for all classes meeting at the same hour to hear an instructor especially competent on a particular topic. Dean Truman said that they thought the lecture series sponsored by the Board of Managers has been sufficient. Accepted by the staff was a recommendation that a list of critical material on the readings be provided to new instructors in the course."
171,Hadas Decides To Come Back In Fall of '65 Professor Had Planned To Retire Last Year,11 December 1964,"Professor Had Planned To Retire Last YearBy Stephen SteinerJay Professor of Greek Moses Hadas, 65, who last spring indicated his intention of retiring, will return to Columbia next fall. Professor Hadas went on a terminal leave following the 1963-4 academic year and is now doing research at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University in Middleton, Conn. A terminal leave generally implies that the leaving professor will not return. The decision to retire was made, he said, because ""I had gotten very tired."" Professor Hadas has decided to return to Columbia, however, because ""people persuaded me that I was a good fellow and that they wanted to come back."" He said that Dean David B. Truman was one of the ""people"" who requested his return. Professor Hadas, who in the past has taught courses in both the College and the Graduate Faculties, has decided to spend most of his time teaching undergraduates. 'T like the College,"" he explained. He will definitely teach Humanities A next year, as he has done in the past, but has not yet announced the other courses he will offer. According to Gilbert Highet, Anthon Professor of the Latin Language and Literature, Di\ Hadas ""has reached one of the two retirement ages."" A professor, he commented, may retire at the age of 65 if he pleases, but must retire when he reaches 68. However, said Professor Highet, ""sometimes when a man is inefficient and unpopular and he reaches 65, the administration will say 'goodbye.' This is not the case with Professor Hadas."" Dr. Hadas has written a ""History of Greek Literature,"" and a ""History of Latin Literature,"" among other books. He has also translated many works from Greek and Latin into English."

Professor Hadas, who last spring announced his retirement, has been appointed a special lecturer in the Greek and Latin Department. Coleman Benedict, representative of the College Greek and Latin Department, said last week that he was happy Professor Hadas was going to teach so many undergraduate courses. In the past, Professor Hadas has taught principally in the Graduate Faculties."
173,Walls of Columbia Provide a Unique Education,26 March 1965,"By Christopher FriedrichsConfronted with mounting tuition costs and stricter admissions requirements, many prospective students are seeking a way to acquire a comprehensive liberal education on Morningside Heights without facing the various obstacles involved in formally registering as a University student. This is easily done. Indeed, the ambitious student can acquire some facility in a variety of disciplines and -immerse himself deeply in Columbia traditions without entering a single building on the campus. All it requires is a careful and selective study of the inscriptions engraved on the buildings, walls, benches, statues and other accoutrements of the Columbia campus. For out of the plethora of ennobling soporifics (""For fellowship and love of alma mater ...""), dedicatory sentiments (""In loving memory 0f...""), grateful selfcongratulation (""Donated by the Class 0f...""), and cornerstone eloquence (""MDCCCXCVIII . . .""), one can mine a hard core of factual information on a broad spectrum of academic traditions. Frieze Aids Frosh Everybody knows, of course, that an informative synopsis of the Humanities A sequence is blazoned across the top of Butler Library, and many have observed the concise summaries of American history and literature engraved in slightly smaller type elsewhere on the Library facade. But to the intrepid outdoor student, these inscriptions are only the beginning of his quest for giveaway knowledge. Simply by wandering about the campus, he can pick up numerous other items of topical information and bits of advice on scholarly methods. The front wall of Casa Italiana, for example, offers an able analysis of Mediterranean history (""Italy, mother of arts, thy hand was once our guard and is still our guide . . .""). The south facade of Schermerhorn Hall provides a failproof method of laboratory inves-tigation in the natural sciences (""Speak to the earth and it shall teach thee . . .""). And the Broadway foundations of Mathematics Hall present, apparently with the aid of some numerically inclined students, a basic truth of calculus (log 2 = .3010). Sound Bodies Enjoined Students intent on career planning can also find answers to many of their questions. Kent Hall, which housed the Law School before it moved across the Law Bridge, informs prospective lawyers that ""IVS"" is an ""ARS BONI ET AEQUI."" Thompson Hall lists the requirements for budding teachers (""Mens sana in corpore sano""), and, in proper pedagogical fashion, proceeds to enumerate five examples, ranging from Colvmbvs to Webster. Municipal history is also widely annotated on the Columbia campus. A plaque on Broadway commemorates Washington's victory in the Battle of Harlem Heights, while a less exultant sign on Am-sterdam Avenue simply lists the ""New York City Defenses During the War of 1812"" — including ""three stone towers"" — and thanks one ""Major General Garrit Hopper Striker"" for unspecified services. A more familiar memorial south of College Walk honors John Purroy Mitchel '99 for his role as Mayor, Alderman and Collector of the City of New York in days gone by. But the inscription-watcher receives the distinctively Morningside flavor of his education only by carefully studying the plaques and memorials to various events and individuals in Columbia's history. The founding and purposes of the University, are distinctively outlined on Low Library, and repeated almost verbatim, in a Latin disguise, on the Hamilton Hall cornerstone. Other memorials, with varying degrees of conspicuousness, honor such individuals as Dean John Howard Van Amringe (""The light that he leaves behind him lies[ upon the paths of men . . ."") and Professor Michael Idvorsky Pupin (""A true guide to the perplexed . . .""). Other plaques provide vital information on geographical aspects of the campus. The green bump on Pupin, for example, is identified as the Rutheford Observatory, named after the ""astronomer and valued trustee"" Lewis Morris Rutheford. Another plaque, moreover, informs one that the building commonly labelled ""Chandler Laboratories"" was originally named ""as a memorial to Evelina M. Harris, pursuant to the provisions of the Last Will and Testament of Ellen C. Harris, who diedon January 2, 1921."" The University's financial history, of course, is also bared to the wandering student. A bench in front of Mathematics Halls, for example, praises one Frederick Arthur Goetze ScD. as a ""champion and guardian of the University."" The explanation for this particularly efulgent description is provided in an apostrophe which identifies Dr. Goetze as a treasurer of the University. Even briefer descriptions of Columbia's financial history are provided by such build— ing inscriptions — brief, but far from cryptic — as ""Furnald,"" ""Hartley,"" ""Uris,"" and ""Seely Wintersmith Mudd.""ABANDONED APPELATION: Only this begrimed green plaque remains to remind the Columbia community that the building commonly called Chandler Laboratories was originally named in honor of Evelina M. Harris. Located on the south facade of the laboratory complex, the plaque is flanked by another one honoring Dean Charles Frederick Chandler, which accounts for the building's more familiar name.EARTHY SUGGESTION: This inscription over the front door of Schermerhorn Hall counsels the student to ""speak to the earth."" Other facades, benches and fences throughout the Morningside campus provide easier-to-follow advice."

AJexandi Dean Alexander said the required interviews would be instituted To give students ""an awareness ol ipproachabflity of the instruct hese courses"" and would not develop into a system."" The idea for compulsory meetings with teachers grew out. of ""discussions with highly academically successful seniors who recommended some measures for closer student-faculty relationships in the freshman year, Dean Alexander stated. He added that he wanted the ters to take the initiative in| scheduling these meetings to demonstrate their accessibility especially ''to the shy, reluctant stunt"" who would otherwise not apj proach the instructor. Dean Alexander noted that for many students, this procedure would be ""merely a formalization of a practice already in existence."" Dean Alexander proposed the system, to the Committee on Instruction at. a meeting in April. The Committee and the Humanities A staff have already accepted the proposal. Dean Alexander will meet next week with the CC A and freshman English staffs to discuss the program. A major revision of the advisory system which would make individual departments responsible for the advising of students in their junior and senior years is currently under consideration."
175,Urge Changes In Humanities Quiz Format Dean Questions Dignity Of Tests in Course,24 November 1965,
176,Pompous Pussyfooting,30 November 1965,"Satisfaction is the only possible reaction to the Committee on Instruction's statement On quizzes in Humanities A. The committee has urged the staff of the course to ""consider seriously the possibility of modifying the form and/or frequency"" of the quizzes. It is time these insults to the student's dignity were questioned, for not only do they serve no useful purpose, but they contribute to an erosion of proper intellectual spirit in the course as well. Defenders of the quizzes justify them on the grounds that in a class so dependent as Humanities A is on discussion, some means is needed to insure that students come to class prepared. Yet it would seem that the teacher can find out in the course of a discussion who has read the book. The quiz by itself will not force anyone to do the reading, ;and should not be utilized simply for such a purpose. According to a recent report by Victor E. Hanzeli, an outsider who studied the course last fall, the holding of quizzes leads to the occasional use of trots or ponies. $ 'When there is simply no time,' and a quiz is coming up,"" the report states, ""an individual student would use a trot without hesitation — and come through with his usual jgrade."" Professor Hanzeli points out that three students reported they had received honors on quizzes by reading only a pony. • ""On the whole,"" he concludes, ""the students treated the matter of quizzes as a minor annoyance, irritating in its pettiness and incongruous with the lofty ideals and admirable content of the course."" But the urging of the Committee on Instruction that ""the form and/or frequency"" of the quizzes might be modified is pompous pussyfooting. Propriety requires the committee to forbear; we may be more direct. The quizzes should be got rid of altogether. The possible substitute suggested by Profesjsir Hanzeli to check the student's progress, monthly ten minute essays, is just as absurd as the quizzes. A student can write very little of any worth in ten minutes, and no essay Question can conclusively measure reading Comprehension. The Humanities A staff should, in the interests of a more dignified offering, abandon any attempt to play policeman. Two papers, midterm and final examinations, and class Jdiscussion should provide an adequate and jsatisfaetory basis for assessing the work of jthe students."
177,Professor Belknap Urges Elimination Of Hum. Quizzes,2 December 1965,"By Alan S. LakeRobert L. Belknap, associate professor of Russian, stated yesterday that he favors the elimination of quizzes in Humanities A. ""The real argument against these quizzes is that they do not really measure whether a student has done the readings,"" the former humanities departmental chairman declared. ""Nobody likes them as they stand now,"" he asserted. His statement follows a recommendation by the Committee on Instruction last week that the quizzes be substantially modified ""in form and frequency."" The Committee's recommendation was prompted by a report by Victor Hanzelli, a professor at the University of Washington. ""The Hanzelli report did not take us by surprise,"" Professor Belknap declared. The Humanities department has discussed changing or eliminating the quizzes almost every year in the past, he explained. ""Perhaps the report will swing the balance against retaining the quizzes,"" Professor Belknap added. Professor of Philosophy Richard L. Kuhns, Jr., chairman of the humanities department, declined to comment on the report until a decision is reached on what changes, if any, will be made. Professor Belknap defended the value of brief essays to be given periodically instead of quizzes, as the Hanzelli report had suggested. ""The essays would serve a pedagogical function,"" he said."
178,Hall Says Vietnam Escalation Might Result in Nuclear War,16 December 1965,"By Christopher FriedrichsGus Hall, chairman of the Communist party.in the United States, charged last night that escalation of the war in Vietnam might result in worldwide nuclear conflict. ""It could be the war to end all wars,"" Mr. Hall told an audience of 300 in McMillin Theatre, ""because it could end all human ex-istence."" Mr. Hall's address was sponsored by Humanities, a newly established organization of General Studies Students. Describing American policy in Vietnam as a ""war of depopulation,"" Mr. Hall charged the administration with ""putting a nation to the torch"" by the extensive use of napalm bombs. The American Communist leader also asserted that the war is favored by major economic interests in the United States. ""This week,"" he stated, ""the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Bank of America announced the openings of their Vietnamese branches."" ""This,"" he asserted, is what the war is all about."" Mr. Hall also charged that the administration does not understand national liberation movements such as the one occuring in Vietnam. ""Yet the American Revolution was a war of national liberation,"" he declared. ""It was a classic example that still inspires the national liberation movements around the world today."" ""If the Johnson administration were seriously concerned about negotiations,"" Mr. Hall stated, it would cease the bombing of North Vietnam and offer to confer directly with representatives of the National Liberation Front. The present offers of negotiations, he asserted, ""are just a cover for further aggression."" Mr. Hall, a stout, florid man with wavy gray hair, answered questions following his address."
179,Freshmen to Read Essays in English On Humanities A Study of Critical Works Planned for 3 Sections,4 February 1966,"Study of Critical Works Planned for 3 SectionsBy Alan S. LakeThree sections of English A will study critical essays on some Humanities A readings on an experimental basis next year. Students in each of the special English classes will be in the same humanities sections. While five or six essays on three of the Humanities readings will be selected and made available for the course, individual instructors will be free to restrict the number of essays used, according to Professor of English A. Kent Hieatt, chairman of the English A Committee. ""The change will mean that instead of using a collection of essays chosen ""out of the blue"" as in the past, we will choose some relating to the humanities readings,"" Professor Hieatt declared. He noted that approximately sixty students will participate in the experiment. The special English sections are designed to demonstrate to the student that his work in the course can improve his written work in other courses, according to Professor Hieatt. The changes, which were proposed by Professor Hieatt and Professor of Philosophy Richard F. Kuhns, Jr., chairman of Humanities A, were approved by the Committee on Instruction Jan. 5. The English department has discussed dividing the approximately twenty students in each humanities section into two smaller English classes. No definite de-cision has been made, however, according to Professor Hieatt. He explained that the extra teaching burden which would be produced by making the sections smaller probably could be absorbed by the department without difficulty. The Committee on Instruction recommended that a record should be kept on each student participating in the experiment. At the end of the 1966-6? academic year, Professors Hieatt and Kuhns will make a report to the Committee on the special sections."
180,"Key Professors Find Report Satisfactory, But Voice Doubts",28 February 1966,"By Martin AndruckiAvailable faculty reaction to the Bell report on general education was mostly favorable late last week with some serious reservations about specific proposals. However, as of Friday evening, many faculty members had yet to read the massive 320 page study.Prof. Orest A. Ranum, chairman of the Contemporary Civilization program, said he was ""impressed by the rationale of the report, in its emphasis on the College experience as a study of the methods of disciplines."" He added that he was not ""completely convinced"" by the study and that he wanted to ""talk further and know more about it."" Professor Ranum expressed particular concern over problems of staffing and interdepartmental relations raised by the report. ""I would be in favor of getting CC. and Humanities to go in tandem,"" he said, but he was uncertain as to how this could be accomplished. Prof. Richard F. Kuhns, chairman of the Humanities A program, declined to comment on the lengthy report saying, ""Give me a chance to read it. I'm a fast reader, but not that fast."" Professor of Englisli Quentin Anderson praised the report calling it ""an exciting challenge to a faculty which has become abysmallyparochial."" Professor Anderson expressed dismay at ""the feebleness of faculty discussion of the Stern Report on Humanities A,"" and said he thought the Bell report ""enables us to really face the question of what a liberal education ought to mean in the sixties."" The Stern report recommended changes in the Humanities reading list as well as special sections for students who had read several of the assigned works before coming to Columbia. One of the recommendations of the present study is that the English A offering ought to be eliminated and that the responsibility for teaching composition be given to secondary schools. Commenting on this proposal, Carl F, Hovde, associate professor of English said, ""It is just not feasible. It would be lovely if it could be done, and tonically I agree with it, but it will be a very long time before the problem of teaching people how to write could be solved by secondary schools."""
181,Sweeping Reforms Science Programs Suggests Senior General Ed Courses; Takes Issue With Barzun Statement,28 February 1966,"Suggests Senior General Ed Courses; Takes Issue With Barzun StatementBy Michael T. GenglerSweeping changes in the curriculum of Columbia College, particularly in the general education programs, have been recommended by Professor of Sociology Daniel Bell in his long-awaited report, ""The Reforming of General Education."" Among the key proposals are a more historical approach to contemporary civilization and humanities, a uniform mathematics-science requirement, and a ""third tier"" of interdisciplinary general education courses designed to ""brake"" the drive toward specialization. The expansion of the College, long advocated to increase its weight within the University and to accommodate increasingly large numbers of applicants, is supported by Professor Bell because of ""the need for experimentation with and the diversification of the curriculum which can be accomplished only within a larger student body."" Professor Bell sees three traditional aims for general education: to provide a ""common learning,"" to give the student a comprehensive understanding of the Western tradition,and to combat intellectual fragmentation with interdisciplinary courses. But his recommendations are designed to formulate a new intellectual structure for general education, the main intent being ""to undercut the distinction between general education and specialism."" The key change suggested for realizing this new goal is the ""third tier"" of general education courses. These courses are designed to make the specialist knowledgeable about ""the logic of inquiry and the philosophical presuppositions of a subject."" Separate sets of third tier courses are proposed for students majoring in the social sciences, the humanities, and the sciences. Courses would deal with the historic foundations of disciplines inSee Bell Supplement for report excerptsa common field, the methodology and philosophy of disciplines in a common field, the application of several disciplines to common problems, and in comparative studies, particularly of non-west-ern cultures. The ""third tier"" would be the fourth and final ""step"" in the College curriculum. First would come history and tradition, through CC and humanities; second, introduction to a discipline; and third, the extension of the discipline to specific subjects, through the major program. Contemporary civilization would be changed to one required term of Greek and Roman history. Then students would have the option to study Western history from the middle ages to the present in one of three tracks: economic, political, or social-intellectual. This sequence would embrace two terms. The fourth term would consist of one of the following introductory courses: economics, sociology, government, anthropology, or geography. Professor Bell suggests that humanities A include more critical and historical reading. A third term to introduce students to modern and contemporary art is also proposed. In order that demands of required courses on the stud-ing a high degree of autonomy and offering a comprehensive program in physical, biological, and social sciences, the humanities, and a division concentrating on ""civilization studies."" Undergraduates at Chicago take four common general courses, two in the first year, one in the second, and a seminar in the final year. Within each division, inter-disci-plinary courses are offered, as well as specialized sequences within each field. ""In moving first toward some effort to instill specialization, and now toward an area concentration as the basis of undergraduate preperation, the University of Chicago has finally reversed the original intention of a common four-year education,"" writes Professor Bell. Harvard's general education program has evolved from proposals of a 1945 report, entitled ""General Education in a Free Society,"" which called for required lowerlevel courses in natural and social sciences, and in the humanities. In addition, the ""Redbook,"" as the report is known, proposed three upper-level general education courses. The Harvard faculty voted to approve the proposals in principle, but a general education program did not become compulsory until 1949. As put into practice, generaleducation at Harvard was substantially different from the program of the Redbook. ""The hope of providing a shared, common experience was never realized,"" writes Professor Bell. General introductory courses were given by the ""great luminaries of Harvard,"" he maintains, but when these men were away, or decided not to teach in a particular year, the course either was not offered, or had a vastly different content when given by a different instructor. The Harvard general education curriculum was revised in 1965 to require the student to take at least four one-year courses outside his major field. Three must be general education courses, one in each of the areas of social and natural science, as well as in the humanities."
182,Curriculum,28 February 1966,"The curriculum at Columbia College, as can be readily seen by a comparison with other schools, is still more integrated than at most other colleges. And the recalcitrance of the problem may lie directly in the structure of knowledge today; and, depending on one's point of view may or may not be a necessary evil. I do believe that intellectually it is necessary and desirable that a greater coherence be achieved and this issue of a more unified curriculum—demonstrated at Columbia in the uneven integration of the lower college and the major programs, and in the problem of intellectual a:::l curricular cooperation between departments in the upper-college program—is the starting point of my own suggestions for the reorganization of the curriculum; and it is to this central question that I now turn. Contemporary Civilization A persistent problem of the Contemporary Civilization A course is the vast amount of reading, as well as the large number of topics that are covered in a single year. In the 1957 report of the Committee on the Educational Future of Columbia University, this problem was singled out for extensive discussion: ""The Committee's conclusion is that 'Contemporary Civilization' and 'Humanities,' for all their indubitable merits, are still so burdened with material that they may give some begin-""Traditionally the university has been a collegium ; it is now becoming a bureaucracy . . . Functions once inseparable from a school's identity have been taken over by specialized and professional personnel without faculty status and often outside faculty control.""hing students misleading conceptions of what disciplined intellectual inquiry demands."" The problem remains. Two of the principal members of the Contemporary Civilization staff, Professors Julian Franklin and Orest Ranum, the new chairman of the course, in a memorandum to the Committee on Instruction, pointed to a conflict of purposes in the present organization of readings: ""As we see it, the selection of materials required to explain the genesis and relationships of institutions and ideas is in conflict with the principle of selection required for close analysis of particular doctrines or periods. In the first case, what is wanted is a wide variety of excerpts; in the second, few selections in much greater length. In our opinion these two aims, each of them legitimate, cannot be reconciled within the framework of a purely documentary approach supplemented only sketchily by synoptic readings in Chapters in Western Civilization."" But from the viewpoint of integrating the lowercollege experience, the greatest single lack is Greek and Roman history, or selected topics of the classical period. In the Humanities course, the major part of the first term is devoted to Greek and Roman writers. There are major selections from Herodotus and Thucydides, Plato and Aristotle, and Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, and Vergil. These are read largely as ""contemporary"" works with little attention to context. But'in the Contemporary Civilization course, there are no readings in this period. Such a lack is startling, especially sirice students today have little opportunity to read classical history. In the secondary schools today, there is almost no intensive reading in ancient history. There are, it seems to me, a number of compelling reasons for beginning with the Greek and Roman per-iods: 1. Such readings would provide a historical context for the Humanities course. 2. The study of such a period shows us societies holding a different view of religion and man, and provides an important basis for the subsequent discussions of the different world views of Christian and Oriental culture. 3. The classical period provides the basis for Western political experience—the idea of democracy and the idea of law. 4. There is a ""comparative"" value in seeing how these early societies dealt with some of the universal sociological problems: the move from tribe to citizenship, the balance of classes, the relation between polities, the role of force and the military, the meaning of imperialism. 5. The historical distance, and the relatively unified nature of the period, allow for varying interpretations of the experiences of these societies. Thus, I would include not only source material but, instead of ""chapters"" of background reading, selections from major historical interpreters, such as Fustel de Colanges, Glotz, Zimmern, Kitto, Gibbon, Mommsen, Dill, Rostovtzeff, and Ronald Syme. This would introduce the problem of historical explanation. I would propose, thus, that the first term of Contemporary Civilization be reorganized to begin with one term in selected topics of Greek and Roman history. There remains the problem of covering subsequent European history to the present. It is clear that this cannot be done in a single year.' The effort to do so in the present C. C. A course, beginning with the medieval period, leads to a hop-skip-and-jump process in which some topics are passed over rapidly in class. I would propose, simply, to acknowledge the difficulty of complete coverage, and not try to deal with so much material in a single course. Rather than just select some periods and omit others, I would propose that the same time-span, the medieval period to the present, be kept, but that these be divided into three channels, each concentrating deliberately on one aspect of an each concentrating deliberately on one aspect of the the history: political history, economic history, and } ocial and intellectual history. In sum, what I am proposing is a new four-term *aquence in Contemporary Civlization. Term one:.A course in Greek and Roman History. Terms two and three: A year's work in Western history, with an option either in political history, economic history or social history. Term four: An option of a single term's work in economics, geography, government, anthropology, or sociology. Humanities Humanities A presents, undemctbly, a set of great works; but read for what purpose? It is striking that the Dean's Committee on the review of the Humanities course, headed by Professor Fritz Stern, reported in its final statement, after a year's' consideration: ""In retrospect it may be considered significant that we found it difficult to define the philosophical or pedagogic ends of the course. We readily agreed that students should read these masterpieces of the past and should even in this rapid manner have to grapple with the timeless themes and ideas inherent in their tradition. We would subscribe to Justus Buchler's forthright dictum 'Humanities was an emancipation from the trivial.' In short, one purpose ol_Jhe confrontation with a great work should be to provoke ""self-consciousness,"" but not only of one's own immediate response, emotionally and intellectually, to a work, but equally the way in which the same work has evoked successively different styles of self-consciousness. The problem for the course is not only to make a student aware of a text but of the scholarly context in which it arose; notonly of his own sensibility, but aware, as well, of the emotions and responses to emotions the work has aroused in others. In sum, the successive histories of mind and sensibility are as integral to the interpretation of a text as the student's (and the instructor's) own ""naive"" responses, for these ""naive"" responses are to some extent a product of such histories. And it is the function of intellectual understanding to mak e this explicit. There are, I think, two ways of accomplishing this end. One is to establish the context of the works that are read. It does not necessarily mean the fatal introduction of historicism to ask that a student understand the world out of which a work of art has emerged as a way of understanding the work itself. Reuben Brower has made the simple point, ""Literature is embedded in history, [and] the meaning of the work itself changes when we view it in relation to other works and to the social situation in which it first appeared."" In this regard, one way would be to reorganize the initial Contemporary Civilization course, in tandem with the Humanities sequence in order to allow for a freer interplay of text and historical contexts. A second way of introducing intellectual sophistication, or an awareness of the way one's own categories of thought are shaped, might be by the introduction of a required third term of Humanities which would deal principally with late-nineteenth-century and twentiethcentury writers. The criterion for a third term of Humanities, or for including any particular writer in such a course is not ""eminence,"" but the ability to shake us up and make us understand our own time and, as part of such insight, the times of the past. More than that, it is part of a process of comprehending how a revolution in the modes of experiencing and expressing experience has occurred; and how such modes, once ""adversary,"" have become established today. If the quite legitimate question is raised of where, in a crowded schedule, room is to be made for one more""The [science] requirement is a mish-mash. It satisfies no logic of general education, other than the nice-sounding statement that the student has had two years of science. ... In place of the present system, I would propose a simple option of one of two two-year sequences: a mathematics-physics sequence, or a mathematics-biology sequence.""required course in the college, the answer is, I think, a simple one: abolish English A, the year of freshman composition. It should not be the function of a college to ""teach"" composition as a separate course. Students are, of course, required to write papers in different courses and more of this is necessary. But one has the right to assume that by the time a student enters college, he can write clearly enough to make a special course in freshman composition unnecessary. The course in Freshman English today is taught by thirty different members of the English department. A course like English A is extremely costly to the college, especially at a time when salaries are rising sharply and teaching schedules are being reduced. Given the general upgrading that is taking place in the secondary schools, it is entirely the responsibility of these schools to assure the proficiency of their students in English composition. The Music and Fine Arts-Humanities, more than the Literature and Philosophy Humanities, have as their implicit premise the awakening of a student to aesthetic experience by a confrontation with masterpieces. They both assume the student's great ignorance about the ""cultural heritage"" of music and painting, and seek to remedy it: by the study of a dozen or so great works of art, in the case of the Fine Arts, and an appreciation of the musical styles of various periods in the case of the Music course. There is a question, given the recent deep-seated changes in American culture (at least in the urban professional class from which Columbia draws so many of its students), whether this notion is still valid. Professor Jack Beeson of the Music Department, in his presentation before the Stern Committee, made the most succinct statement of the case: ""If the secondary schools did a better job in music there would be no need for the Music B Course."" It may well be that in the next decade this will prove to be true. It certainly indicates that the colleges should take the lead in spurring the secondary schools to do a ""better job."" Such a change would be no excuse for the abolition of a music and fine arts sequence from a Humanities course. But it would be an argument for changing the nature of such courses. Words are not the only mode of communication, particularly in our time, when painting, cinema, and architecture are the paramount arts, and ours has become so much a ""visual culture."" It is an important aspect of a liberal education that the student receive some intensive experience not only in modes of discourse but of visual perception and aural discrimination. And if the art and music ""appreciation""work is done in earlier years, then the College courses could turn their attention, in the case of fine arts, to the nature of design and perception —both to the phychological processes by which we create visual images and the understanding of styles against a specific context, in terms of historically available alternatives; and in the case of music, to a comparative study of the organization of ""sounds"" and the esthetic principles which underlie the arrangements of sound. In this respect, one experimental proposal might be in order: that the Music and Fine Arts Humanities be extended to a year each, and that students who have demonstrated a competence, say, in music be allowed to take a year's work in fine arts, the first term of which would be devoted to masterpieces and the second in the broader nature of the visual modes; conversely, a student who, on entering the College, has shown knowledge in the fine arts would be allowed to take a year's work in music, as a means of fulfilling the requirement of a second year in Humanities. Science Requirement 'Columbia students today are required, in fulfilling the requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, to take two years of work in mathematics and science. This can be a full-year course in any two sciences or, alternatively, a single two-year course in one of the sciences: astronomy, botany, chemistry, geographygeology, mathematics, physics, psychology, and zoology. The requirement is a mish-mash. It satisfies no logic of general education, other than the nice-sounding statement that the student has had two years of science. Over the last three decades, the College has wrestled with the problem. In 1946, the Carman Committee reported, ""two successive efforts' have been made at Columbia to breach this [science requirement] impasse."" And in 1957, the MacMahon Committee stated, ""For at least twenty years the College has struggled with this part of its program."" As one administrator ruefully remarked, ""our situation is no worse than anybody else's."" That is true. The existence of. a ""distribution requirement"" (i.e. an open choice of any option) is a common one. But it is a condition in need of remedy. The best method is to teach science by requiring the student to learn a particular discipline, modifying the material to give him some knowledge of the conceptual basis of the discipline. But if no one is to teach science in an orderly sequence, then the present ""distribution"" system should be restricted, particularly since not all of the courses now open to the student teach science as conceptual inquiry, but simply give him a ""rhetoric of conclusions"" or some dogmatic statement about what is known, at present, in that field. Such an experience is worse than none at all, for the student assumes that he is acquiring a fixed body of knowledge, when he is in fact learning some conclusions that may be outdated ten years hence. He has learned little about the process of science as inquiry. In place of the present system, I would propose a simple option of one of two two-year sequences: a mathematics - physics sequence, or a mathematics - biology sequence. The rationale for concentrating on physics or biology, rather than any of the other sciences, seems to me to be equally clear. Physics and biology exemplify orderly theoretical structure formulated in conceptual paradigms that are themselves open to change as new principles of inquiry, or new perspectives create new theoretical solutions or challenges. Physics is the foundation of our inquiries in a wide range of sciences, from cosmology to biology. It shapes to a considerable extent our philosophical outlooks as well as our practical activities. In biology, the current ""clash"" between classical biology with its emphasis on observation and experiments with living organisms, organs, and cells, and ""molecular biology,"" with its assumption that chemical constituents separated from the cell can become the unit of study, affords a fascinating example for the present-day student of the ""paradigmatic revolution"" in a science that promisesto create as much change in biology in the next two decades as the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics created in physics in the first two decades of this century. Major Requirement What is the function of the major? Most departments would reply: to provide a basic minimum of specialization and coverage in a field. But to what end? As a direct stepping-stone to graduate work in the field; to provide some knowledge of a particular discipline or subject as the background for professional or related work (e.g., in law or medicine); or what? In the sciences (particularly physics and chemistry) a considerable number of the majors in these subjects had determined to go on to graduate study in the fields. But in History and English —the departments with the largest number of majors in the College, accounting in some years for about twenty to even twenty-five per cent of all students in a class —less than a fourth or so of the majors in those departments intend to go on to graduate study in that subject. The question then is, for what reasons does a student take a major; for background purposes or for subsequent specialized use. Clearly, other than the sciences, both reasons are operative. Most departments, it would seem, have planned their major in order to give a student the basic amount of work necessary to give a student a specializing knowledge of the field, on the assumption that he would go on to graduate work and become a professional in that field. The introduction of ""multi-tracks"" in the elementary courses showed that the departments were aware of the different kinds of ""introductory"" work for students with different needs. But it may well be that there is a need for ""multitracks"" in the major programs as well, in order to satisfy the varying needs of majors as well. In these instances, one might ask the departments to scrutinize their major programs with an eye to the different purposes they might serve, rather than the single purpose of professional training in the subject. This is particularly true of the three social-science departments — history, government, and economics — which comprise nearly 35 per cent of all college majors, and whose students seek preparation for graduate work, a background for law school, training for business, for ! government service, and the like. Third Tier The very conception of an intellectual discipline implies a method of analysis and a logical framework of concepts at high levels of generality and, indeed, of abstraction. The heart of a college education today is mastering a discipline (not acquiring a specialization, which is a fixed knowledge of a small piece of subjectmatter through the use of a discipline). But within a liberal-arts framework, mastering a discipline gains a significant dimension only if that mastery is placed within a proper sequence of understanding. What I have been proposing is such an orderjy sequence. The idea of the ""third tier"" is that it would apply for each field, or set into appropriate context, the knowledge previously acquired. The College curriculum would thus be organized on these four ""steps"": a) History and Tradition. The first step is a detailed discovery, through the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities program, of the history and traditions of Western civilization, the awareness of the great works of moral imagination and science, the basic processes of social change, the great intellectual movements of self-conscious reflection and ideas on the events of change. b) Introduction to a Discipline. The second step is the introduction to a discipline. Through the proposed ""math-science"" courses, the non-scientist will have a detailed sense of how a specific science aquires, utilizes,and revises its basic concepts. Through the proposed social-science options, all students will have the opportunity of learning how at least one social science organizes its perspective on society; and in the case of the social-scierrce major, he will have an introduction to a discipline other than his own. c) The Extension of the Discipline to Subjects. The organization of the major program is essentially the application of the discipline to different subject matters in the field, and this would be the heart of the third year and the upper-college courses. d) The ""Third Tier."" The ""third tier"" is a synoptic program, at the senior level, whose purpose is twofold: (1) to deal with the methodological and philosophical (and, in the case of the social sciences, historical) presuppositions of a field; (2) to show the application of the discipline to general problems, or to issues requiring a multi-disciplinary approach in order to test the operation of the discipline in a wider context. So defined, the third-tier courses become a distinctive contribution to general education. They seek to explore interrelated issues between disciplines, to try to create a philosophical sophistication about the foundations of the fields, and to raise, where possible, value problems in the application of the discipline. The same third-tier, or synoptic, courses would not be required of all students in the College: each division —the social sciences, the humanities, and the sciences —would have third-tier courses appropriate to the particular problems of each field, and each student within a divisional area would be required, in his senior year, to take a specified number of these ""third-tier"" courses. While these would be required for students within each division, there is no reason why they should not be open to qualified students who would want to take some third-tier courses in fields other than their own. In principle, there would be four kinds of courses in the third tier. These would be courses in: a) the historical foundations of the intellectual disciplines in the field; b) the methodological 'and philosophical presuppositions of the disciplines; c) the extension of the various disciplines to applied problems; d) comparative studies, particularly of non-West-ern cultures. As to the practical problem of fitting these courses into the student's schedule, there is a simple pointer to a solution: since almost all departments usually require ""related courses"" as part of the major program — courses amounting usually to twelve credits, or four courses — the third tier, if accepted by the College, would become the ""related courses"" in the major requirement of the departments. Such a procedure would not necessarily cut unduly into the number of free electives available to a student. Since the requirement of ""related courses"" is itself presumably a limitation on what the students can offer a department in work for his major, the third-tier courses, including as they inevitably will, a number of options, become the arena of elective choice. To exemplify the kinds of third-tier courses I have in mind, I will make here a number of specific proposals. The Social Sciences 1. The Historical Emergence of the Social Sciences in the 19th Century. More than other fields—at least at this stage of their development—the social sciences can be understood only in part as historical disciplines. The problems posed for each discipline are still rooted in their histories; the differences in points of view are still derived from conflicting schools of thought. The course would cover the emergence of economics, political science, sociology, psychology, and anthropology as separate disciplines out of philosophy and general political thought."
183,Faculty 'Smokers' Planned on Study,15 March 1966,"A series of five faculty ""smokers"" will be held during the next month to determine general reaction to the Bell Report. At the first meeting Wednesday night, the structure of the report and Professor Bell's third tier proposals will be discussed. Subsequent smokers are scheduled for April 6, 11, 18, and 27. Discussion at the second meeting will center on the report's suggestions for the Humanities A and Contemporary Civilization A courses. Professor Bell's proposed revision for the science requirement will be the topic of the third gathering. The fourth and fifth meetings have been left open for general discussion. Invitations have been sent to all college faculty members by Dean David B. Truman."
184,EXCELSIOR Jester,15 March 1966,"JesterBy Dave HeimPaul Gewirtz, the ""In lumine tuo videbimus lumen"" of Jester, remarked last autumn that a dirty joke is one of the few forms of humor guaranteed to elicit a laugh. The current Jester provides an opportunity to prove this theory since it contains an ample amount of anal humor. There is enough clean humor in any event, to make this issue the most consistently funny issue in two years. Without a doubt the ""Portfolio of Recent Graduates"" is the most uproariously funny photo spread to be inserted in Jester's pages in recent years. An unrelenting: slap at Columbia College Today's photo feature of the same name, it is a satiric masterpiece. Gewirtz and company have copied exactly the ostentatious verbiage and stiffly-posed pictures which CCT employs so seriously. The mockery made of Humanities A and the characterizations of Francis McMatzoh (the convert to Judaism and elephant circumeiser,) ""Gym"" Kowalski (the football player-cum-sandwich-maker from Grunt, N. Dak.), and Youngblood Hawke II ((called 'Douche' because ol the II after his name) effectively point up the pompous public relations attempts of the alumni magazine. This article deserves the highest praise. Happily, the Editaurus department maintains the same high level of mockery. Gone is the usual, arti-ficially-off-hand ""Well, here we are again, clasping our ox's skull by the horns,"" sort of syntax. This month's Editaurus is well-phrased and incisive; and, while cynically written, its point is all too true. Spiritual affliction, the search for ""ultimate things,"" is ""a pain in the ass"" and ""we are the generation which wants more than merely the home in Scarsdale and the car and the TV . . . that's what we've been looking for: not the Fat Lady, Buddy, but the Fat Lady's weight in gold."" Sadly, however, Jester's quality begins to decline with the Campus Fugit pages. In contrast to the skimpiness of Jester's last issue, the Fugit pages are full for a change. The artwork on these two pages is the best —and most profuse —in recent memory. Outstanding here is a clever representation of a chap Who bears a remarkable resemblance to Bennett Cerf, former Jester editor, a representation made up of such words as ""Sex,"" ""Erotic,"" ""Defunct libido, etc."" Unfortunately, Al Beyer's cartoon strip ""The Rat"" mars an otherwise superb collection of drawings; his melodrama about a rat and his struggle with a vending machine is crudely drawn and inane in the extreme. Most of the anecdotes are not much better than ""The Rat."" There is the usual atrocious pun: this time, it's ""The Eisenhower School of General Studies."" And, the poem, ""Spring Song,"" comes across as a dull, mediocre effort. This month's centerfold is an ornate, ostentatious mural called the ""Compendium of Universal Knowledge,"" sketched by Dan Colbert and Charles Stainback. The ""Universal Knowledge"" consists of an anthology of confused and irrelevant facts, most of which can be found in contemporary datebooks or Mad Magazine. Yet the artists' master touch with the pen redeems this article, for their draftsmanship is clear, direct and professional. The quality of the magazine continues to decline with ""The Bastard,"" a tedious effort by Richard Jupa, clearly the poorest part of the magazine. This tale of a ruined spring vacation palls on the reader after the first column of type; Jupa describes a bastard, to be sure, but he describes him in too much detail. The concluding paragraph, in which plans are made to destroy the bastard with a stake ""through the heart,"" comes across as contrived and irrelevant. Gewirtz claimed last year, that readers are loath to plod through a long article. How unfortunate it is that an effort was made to disprove this theory by printing ""The Bastard."" This Jester must be called good, not great, but it does show promise. It is certaily an improvement over the most recent issues of the magazine. The next issue should be better. Perhaps even superb."
185,Five Major Campus Publications to Merge,5 April 1966,"The editorial boards of four campus newspapers and George Keller agreed last night to consolidate their publications in a move to keep pace with the academic merger. Michael A. Melnin '66, editor of the Columbia Daily Spectator; Sara Lee Pieova '688, editor of the Barnard Bulletin; Lorna Doone, '54GS, editor of the Owl; Sam Bridges, 69E, editor of the Pulse; and George Keller concurred formally ""that five could do it better than one but not better than two or, perhaps, three."" Under the new articles of incorporation, the publications will be. reoriented to a daily morning and evening paper, and one Sunday edition. Columbia College Daily will become the a.m. edition, while the Barnard Pulse Today will provide the University community with evening entertainment. Every Sunday morning, the corporation will also publish the Coluvibia-Bar-iiard Spectator Sunday Daily and Saturday Evening Keller, an issue which the new editors claim will ""'also please readers of the old CCT and other magazines of the Reader's Digest variety."" The new Sunday edition will feature a new literary review section, edited by Melnin. Asked what his first book review will be, Melnin answered, ""All the King's Men,"" of course. It's the best novel I ever read. I always think of it whenever culture is mentioned."" Many small problems are anticipated by the proposed journalistic merger, and according to one source, ""some real enormities."" George Keller, '03, former editor of CCT, claimed that ""the biggest enormity is the fact that I now have no job."" Keller explained that ""for fifty years I have been projecting an unchanging picture of the typical Columbia man."" ""Now,"" he sighed, ! ""they want me to project the composite picture of an All-American quarterback with a 38-24-26, who powders his nose before every I play."" ""I simply can't do it; Ii must retire."" Keller said, however, that he would miss Columbia. ""Humanities A was a great course,"" he concluded. Miss Pieova claimed that as production manager in the new corporation, she has hit upon some | real circulation and distribution boosters. ""I plan to have bunny newsgiris out on the streets"" she claimed."
186,The Peardon Proposal,6 April 1966,"The recent decision of the Barnard faculty to adopt the four-course system proposed by the committee on curriculum is an important acknowledgement that there is need for improvement in the Barnard curriculum. At the same time, however, the plan appears to reject many of the vital elements of a liberal arts education. The Barnard committee, chaired by Professor Emeritus of Government Thomas P. Peardon, has presented a plan which will decrease the number of courses taken by {he student and pave the way for early specialization. Professor Peardon admitted recently that his group's recommendations favor a theory of education diametrically opposed to that expressed in Professor Daniel Bell's study on the College curriculum, which calls for an increased emphasis on general education. Under the proposed four-course plan, Barnard students would need 32 courses to graduate, instead of a specified number of froints. In an ordinary semester, then, the Student would take only four courses, instead of the usual five. While,it is understood that many classes would undergo reVision and broadening, the overall effect will be to narrow the range of courses available to the student. The Peardon Report calls for early specialization in the freshman year, arguing that there is currently an ""insufficient variety . . . and a rush in that year to fulfill requirements covering the same ground as high school."" But general education courses in a liberal arts college need not and should not be such that they merely ""cover the same ground as in high school."" Professor Bell has maintained that appreciation of such material as is covered in Humanities A depends in part on the maturity of the student. That some high schools have improved their curricula is not an argument against the liberal arts tradition in colleges. Another difference between the curriculum revisions suggested in the Bell report and those under consideration at Barnard is the Peardon committee's emphasis on majors. The Barnard report asserts that the setting of an upper limit on the number of courses which can be required for a major would be ""a mistaken policy."" ""A better case could be made for increasing the minimum number of points required,"" the report continues. But such a program would further reduce the number of courses not related to his major which a student could take. What is most disturbing about the Peardon Committee's proposal is not its inherent departure from general education, but rather its assumption that a liberal education will be achieved despite specialization. Professor Peardon . stated two weeks ago that the new system would allow scope for general education but that the initiative would remain ""with the major department and student."" Unfortunately, this is where the initiative has too often been. While the Bell Report serves to affirm that general education is important enough to be built into thecurriculum, the Barnard plan makes no such commitment. The Peardon Report does suggest a survey reading course for the freshman year, but otherwise discounts the value of a comprehensive general review of various aspects of civilization. Faculty debate over the implementation of the four-course plan may well alter the proposal. It must be understood at the outset, however, that the Peardon Report is a step away from general education."
187,Humanities and CC May Be Combined Into One Course Joint Course May Hare Trial Run Next Year,20 April 1966,"Joint Course May Hare Trial Run Next YearBy Robert FriedmanA new course, combining Contemporary Civilization A and Humanities A, may be ofie-re-d next year on an experimental basis, according to Associate Professor of History Orest Ranum, chairman of the contemporary civilization department. Each section of the composite course, which has been proposed by the Revision Committee of the CC department, would have two instructors, and would meet six hours a week for eight points, Professor Ranum sa'id yesterday. The -hybrid course would be called ""Humanities, Society, and Thought in Western Civilization."" Professor Ranum termed the proposal for the new course ""an outgrowth of thinking on the Bell Report."" He noted, however, that although it provided for a greater study of classical civilization, as recommended in Professor of Sociology Daniel Bell's recent report supporting general education, it was ""not compatible with several of his recommendations."" The committee's plan was discussed and if enough staff members volunteer to teach the course, it will be presented to the Committee on Instruction for approval, Professor Ranum reported. Faculty reaction ""indicated that there is hopefully sufficient support to offer several experimental sections to the Class of 1970,"" he said. This proposal would encompass only the first year of CC and Humanities. The Bell Report calls for a restructuring bf both years after one semester of classical civilization. Professor Bell's ""three-track"" plan requires two semesters of Western civilization stressing political, economic, or social development. According to the coriimittee's proposal this is ""incompatible"" with the one year composite course. The merger of contemporary civilization and humanities, although not called for in the Bell Report, is recommended by the committee because ""a combined syllabus would make it possible to util both whole works and excerpts."" ""It would eliminate the im -pression that CC concerns a fixed set of doctrines and facts, and tend to guide the student's attention to the subject matter itself,"" the report continues. In addition, he noted that ""the new combined syllabus would provide study of the historical, intellectual, and social contexts of the works that are now considered as relatively isolated phenomena in the humanities course."" The proposal envisions each of the two instructors attending four of the six hours, providing two hours a week when both teachers would be present. Both instructors would be expected to know the entire syllabus. Thetheory behind this, according to the proposal, is that ""the very presence of the two teachers generates excitement for the group as a whole and weakens the division between the active authority and the passive student."" Difficulties in the present CC course are attributed by the committee to the student's desire to further distill what already are distillations of important works. The new course is also an attempt to improve the present state of Humanities A, whose syllabus, the report claims, contains ""a miscellany of books, each of enormous merit, but considered from a viewpoint that tends to the purely aesthetic."""
188,Bell Study Favors General Education,20 September 1966,"By Eleanor Prescott""The university cannot remake the world . . . The xmiversity cannot even remake men. But it can liberate young men by making them aware of the forces that impel them from within and constrict them from without. This, in in itself, is the enduring rationale of a liberal education and the function of the college years."" —Reforming General Education Ever since Dean of Faculties Jacques Barzun declared in 1963 that ""the liberal arts are dead or dying"" those who disagree with him have sought a representative to effectively champion the role of general education in contemporary society. The opposition has at last found its spokesmen in Professor of Sociology Daniel Bell, the author of ""Reforming General Education."" In the 320-page report of his two year study, Professor Bell concludes that the concept of""liberal"" or ""general"" education continues to retain validity. He concedes however that the existing curriculum in the College must be reformed in order to give it relevance in the context of the new knowledge, increasing specialization and the new social and ideological setting of society that universities are called upon to reflect. To effect the changes he recommends, Professor Bell declares that ""intellectually it is necessary and desirable that a greater coherence be achieved"" in the curriculum. He maintains that a broad expansion of the College's general education program is required to attain this goal. ""Third Tier"" A key proposal of the report calls fora new ""third tier"" of general education courses, to be taken in the senior year. These courses would ""apply for each field, or set into appropriate context, the knowledge previously acquired."" Separate sets of ""third tier"" courses are recommended for students majoring in the social sciences, the humanities and the sciences. Each division would offer courses dealing with the his-torical foundations of the various disciplines within the field, the the methodology and philosophy of the disciplines, the application of various disciplines to common problems, and comparative studies, particularly of non-Western cultures. The ""third tier"" would be the fourth and final step in the College curriculum. It would be preceded by the contemporary civilization and humanities programs, introduction to a discipline, and extension of the discipline to subjects. C.C. Changed The present one-year contemporary civilization course would be changed to one semester of Greek and Roman history. A student would then select a full-year Western history course from one of three tracks —political, economic or social history. A fourth term of introduction work in a specific sdcial science other than history would be optional. Under the terms of the report, Humanities A readings would be changed to include more critical and historical works and a third terms would be added to deal with the nineteenth and twentieth century writers.In order to create room for the additional required courses, Professor Bell proposes to abolish English A. He maintains that ""colleges should take the lead in spurring the secondary schools to do a 'better job' "" of teaching composition. Science Requirement Terming the present two-year science requirement ""a mishmash,' Professor Bell proposes a uniform math-physics or math-bio-logy sequence to be required of all non-science majors. Professor Bell also suggests that social science and humanities majors be required to take a year' course in their division in non-Western civilizations. Music and Fine Arts Humanities would each be expanded to a full year. The students would elect one of the two courses, which would both stress the nature of art rather than its ""appreciation."" The Bel] report—which, according to Dean David B. Truman, was intended as ""a basis for discussion"" —has provoked heated debate within the faculty. Some professors have sharply criticized specific proposals, particularly the science requirement. Others have evolved new proposals on the basis of Professor Bell's recommendations. Report Criticized ""Professor Bell understands many things but science is not one of them,"" University Professor I. I. Rabi declared in March. ""He vastly underestimates theplace of science and the scientific spirit in western culture."" The Nobel laureate in physics suggested that the existing science requirement be jioubled rather than cut in half as proposed by Bell. Echoing his fellow laureate's criticism of the Bell report, Professor of Physics Polykarp Kusch called the proposed science requirement ""unrealistic"" and said that .it put ""undue emphasis on other matters."" While the Committee on Instruction works this semester on formulating the specific proposals for courses and curriculum on which the faculty will vote, the general debate on the relative merits of the report will undoubtedly continue. Foremost in many minds will be the doubts expressed in March by Dean Barzun as to how successful curriculum reforms could be in preserving the liberal arts."
189,Eng.-Humanities Program Started,5 October 1966,"Four experimental sections of a program combining Humanities A and freshman English have been set up this fall, while another more radical proposal calling fora combined Humanities and Contemporary Civilization course has not yet reached the trial stage. Assistant Professor of English George Stade, chairman of the freshman English program, reported yesterday that the four sections of the Humanities-Eng-lish course ""filled up quite rapidly."" There are 75 students enrolled in the program. Under the experiment, the curriculum of the English ° course is designed to accompany the readings in the Humanities section. In the past, the freshman English program has not in any way been related to Humanities. Students' enthusiasm, according to Professor Stade ""does not necessarily reflect the success of the program. Rather, many students thought the combination might mean lesswork for them."" Professor Stade said he is opposed to the program, claiming that it ""destroys the autonomy of freshman English."" The experiment was engineered by Associate Professor of English A. Kent Hieatt and Associate Professor of Philosophy Richard F. Kuhns. The Iliad is now being read in the Humanities course, while heroism is being discussed in the English part of the parallel program. The other proposal, which com-bines Humanities and CC, is lying fallow until enough faculty interest is stimulated, Associate Professor of History Orest Ranum, one of the designers of the program, stated yesterday. Under this plan, there would be one ""block"" course of eight points, taught by two instructors. The curricula of Humanities and Contemporary Civilization would be revised to coordinate the readings. The possibility that an experimental section of this combined course could have been established this fall was contingent on faculty interest, ""which was never shown,"" Professor Ranum remarked."
190,Reinstate Quizzes In Humanities A; Experiment Fails,5 October 1966,"By Robert FriedmanHumanities A quizzes, on the verge of disappearing last semester, have been restored as a course requirement, Professor Richard F. Kuhns, chairman of the Humanities program, stated yesterday. Last January, the Humanities staff voted by a three to one margin to have quizzes given at the discreation of the instructor. ( However, at the end of the semester, the staff decided ""almost unanimously that the experiment was not working, that students were negligent in their reading without quizzes, and that the tests should be put back on a mandatory basis,"" Professor Kuhns said. Earlier last year, the Committee on Instruction had recommended that the Humanities A quizzes be seriously modified in ""form and frequency."" Dean David B. Truman said at that time that the tests were ""not necessarily constructive to the tone and style of the course."" The weekly quizzes prescribed by the department consist mostly of multiple choice questions. ""If a professor is not satisfied with this format, he may give a substitute,"" Professor Kuhns stated. He added that the quizzes may be removed next semester if the staff desires it. However, the general belief was estab-lished at the end of last year that ""it helps teachers to have quizzes, especially during the first semester, and that the tests do get students to read,"" he reported. Professor Kuhns explained the short duration of the experiment by saying that, ""it doesn't take long to see if students read the books or not."" No survey was conducted by the department to discover exactly how many of the students actually read the books assigned. However, many of the instructors questioned their classes, and most came to the conclusion that ""quizzes do deserve a necessary function,"" Professor Kuhns declared."
191,English A,10 October 1966,"To the Editor: As a participant in the experimental sections of paired English and Humanities A, I should like to comment on Professor Stade's allegation (Spectator, Oct. 5) that ""many students"" (in the experiment)thought the combination might mean less work them. This was a surprise to me. During registration the paired courses were a prime topic for discussion. Such reasoning as getting a more integrated study; having perhaps deeper discussions; making what upperclassmen class as a boring, useless, course more worthwhile; even participating in an experiment was a drawing card. ""Less work"" I did not encounter, not in general conversation, nor in classroom discussion. At no time was I formally questioned as to my reasoning; none of the other students enrolled in the experiment with whom I talked were aware of any form of survey, either. To me, the experiment appears to be a step forward to Columbia's ideal of general education. Perhaps the pairing does ""destroy the autonomy of freshman English."" I do not understand the correlation of an autonomous freshman English department to my Columbia goals. But as a naive, idealistic freshman I am not familiar with departmental prestige. I do hope that quests for status do not often interfere with my education. Bob Homan '70 Oct. 5, 1966"
192,"Discussion on Humanities, CC Might Alter Course Curricula",2 November 1966,"Discussions that may lead to a revamping of Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses along the lines of parallel curricula were begun last week at the first meeting of the Humanities A-CC A committee. A committee on ""third-tier"" courses, the second of two committees established as a result of the ""smokers"" on the Bell report, will hold its first meeting in two weeks, Professor of Economics Harold Barger, chairman of the committee, reported. Orest Ranum, associate professor of history and a member of the Humanities CC Committee, explained that ""discussion at the organizational meeting was quite general, and we are not even sure where we are going from here."" Last spring, the faculty approved a proposal of the Committee on Instruction to set up these committees for the purpose of examining various aspects of Professor of Sociology Daniel Bell's report ongeneral education. A third committee, to study Professor Bell's proposals for the sciences at Columbia, may also be formed. The members of the Hum-anities-CC committee are Richard F. Kuhns, Humanities A chairman, Orest Ranum, chairman of the CC-A program, Joseph A. Rothschild, associate professor of government, Daniel E. Gershenson, assistant professor of Greek and Latin, Angus Fletcher, assistant professor of English, and Thomas S. Colahan, associate dean and chairman of the committee. Members of the third-tier committee in addition to Professor Barger are Arthur C. Danto, professor of philosophy, Ellis R. Kolchin, professor of mathematics, Julian M. Miller, professor of chemistry, Allan M. Sachs, professor of physics, Richard A. Gregg, associate professor of Russian and Werner R. Schilling, associate professor of government."
193,Improving Freshman English,6 December 1966,"Professor Lionel Trilling has remarked to his undergraduate classes that the main deficiency of the College graduates in his graduate seminar is their inability to write. He has also suggested that by the time a student begins work on his Ph.D. the opportunity for improving written expression has been lost. Since for most College men freshman English is the occasion wherein confidence of written expression is acquired or inarticulation guaranteed, we welcome the proposal of Assistant Professor of English George Stade to make writing itself the very core of this program. Over the years, the emphasis in freshman English has resided restlessly in several areas. Since each student in the program must pass an elementary grammar test, some instructors have tended to spend listless hours teaching their classes about gerunds, participles and other dismembered grammatical limbs forgotten or ignored by erring high school teachers. In other situations, freshmen have been set to work scribbling essays ""inspired"" by other essays, usually from anthologies whose dry content is surpassed only by their forbidding style. The latest of the ""noble experiments"" to be performed on the weak course is a transfusion from Humanities A. For the last year or so four experimental sections have been busy preparing interpretive essays based on Herodotus, Aristophanes and St. Augustine. The simple fact is that all of these approaches are wrong. The arguments against a grammaticallyoriented English A are obvious: instructors who emphasize exercises in syntax are wasting valuable undergraduate time. If the College admits a student with a faulty sense of tenses, he can and must improve this deficiency on his own, for Columbia has more important things to teach him. The College should not be a remedial course for poor performance in secondary school. Professor Stade has indicated the dangers of a freshman program organized around the study of essays. Not only is there a question of the models becoming a bad influence, but also there is a question of whether any student should force himself into the mold of another's style, no matter how admirable that style. Coupling with Humanities tends to make the English course something else, an unequal partner in an uncomfortable relationship. Students will try to express themselves, but the ominous subject matter must intimidate them. Many will run to a higher source and parrot its opinions, while others will lose all hold on form in the difficult struggle with content. Professor Stade has recommended that freshman English become a course in discursive writing instead of grammar or criticism. He is right. For what a student needs to become a competent writer is an opportunity to develop his own style, explore his own possibilities. He must not be unduly pressed to imitate others; he must be given a subject which he can handle, one with which he is comfortable enough to write without the pomposity and pretension which uncertainty can produce. Once the freshman has developed a comfortable style, he can apply his abilities to more difficult subject matters. As long as students have an undeveloped writing style they will have essays as weak as if they had undeveloped ideas. Professor Stade's proposal is a step toward producing better writers. After taking it, students should be able to leave freshman English with greater confidence. And perhaps even more of them—College graduates—will find their way to Mr. Trilling's graduate seminar."
194,"Ward Will Assume Schweitzer Chair Noted British Economist, Author Named To $100,000 a Year Professorship",12 December 1967,"Noted British Economist, Author Named To $100,000 a Year ProfessorshipBy ROBERT FRIEDMANBarbara Ward, the renowned British economist, has been nominated by the University to fill its Albert Schweitzer chair in the Humanities, a spokesman for the state Office of Higher Education disclosed yesterday. Columbia's Schweitzer chair, the last of five such professorships, was awarded by the state Board of Regents in June. The chair will be in the School of International Affairs. According to the spokesman, Columbia made a request for a Schweitzer chair in June, nominating only Miss Ward for the position. The request and thenomination were approved by the Board of Regents later that month, he said. An announcement by the University is expected as soon as Miss Ward's appointment is finalized. It is understood that she will join the faculty of the economics department in addition to assuming her position next fall in the School of International Affairs. The school will receive state funds up to $100,000 a year tc support the Schweitzer professor, her assistants, andresearchactivities. Miss Ward is the only woman to receive a Schweitzer chair. The five Schweitzer chairs were stablished in.1964 by the state legislature to attract to New York some of the world's top-ranking scholars. Among those who have since been appointed to Schweitzer professorships are Arthur Schlesinger Jr. at City College, Marshall McLuhan at Fordham University, and Conor Cruise O'Brien at New York University. Miss Ward is the wife of Sir Robert Jackson, but uses her ma iden name professionally. She is the author of eleven books, including ""The Rich Nations and the Poor Nations"" and ""Five Ideas That Change the World."" It is understood that Miss Ward was under consideration last year as a candidate for the presidency of Barnard College.Born in England in 1914, Miss Ward was educated in Germany and at Oxford. She has been an editor of ""The Economist,"" a British publication, has lectured and conducted seminars at Harvard, and has served in advisory capacities to both the British and United States governments. The award ofthefifthSchweitzer chair to Columbia was announced by the state this summer. The announcement said that the chair's he'der would be expected to ""work in the mainstream of the existing activities of the faculty of international affairs."" Because her appointment has not yet been finalized, it has not been determined what courses Miss Ward will teach. Both Miss Ward, who was en route from Washington to Brussels, and Andrew W.Cordier,deanof the School of International Affairs, who was in Stockholm, were unavailable for comment yesterday. It is understood that Columbia nominated Miss Ward, an expert in international economics and in the growth of underdeveloped countries, for the Schweitzer chair to fill a gap in international economics in the International Affairs School.Barbara Ward"

196,Extensive Revisions Of CCA Syllabus Will Be Discussed Rothschild Is Appointed Program's Chairman,11 April 1968,"Rothschild Is Appointed Program 's ChairmanBy JOHN KOUTSOSThe syllabus of Contemporary Civilization A will be placed under review in a conference at Arden House next weekend which will ""investigate the whole nature of the course,"" according to Associate Professor of History Orestßanum, CC chairman. The conference, which will be held at the former estate of Averill Harriman April 19 through 21, will be attended by the CCA staff and a small number of selected students. It is expected that major revisions in the syllabus and a new statement of purpose for the course will be made, Professor Ranum said yesterday. Professor Ranum, who has served as chairman of the program for three years, will be succeeded next year by Joseph Rothschild, associate professor of government. The appointment whichtakes effect July 1 was announced yesterday by Vice Dean Thomas S. Colahan. An expert in East Central European government, Professor Rothschild said yesterday that the greatest problem confronting the CC program is a high rate of staff turnover. Among the topics of discussion at the conference will be the possibility of transfering the course's emphasis from a long chronology to a s'eries of concentrations on ""certain works and periods,"" Professor Ranum stated. , .Although he emphasized that he, could in no way predict the results of the conference, he did mention the possibility of replacing one of the source books with a series of paperback books. The possibility of paralleling CCA and Humanities A courseswill ""definitely* be discussed. In a parallel course arrangement, both courses deal with readings from the same time periods. The members of the conference will probably also discuss the idea of individual sections emphasizing special topics or books decided upon by both the teacher and his students."
197,CCA Syllabus: The 'Relevance' Issue,16 April 1968,"By JOHN KOUTSOSThis weekend the first-year Contemporary Civilization staff and a few selected students will delve into that unwieldy conglomeration of ideas and events known as CCA with the intention of reshaping it into a more comprehensible and more stimulating course. The discussions are expected to produce a revised syllabus and . a new statement of purpose. Formulation of a state- J>£vv» jment of purpose 'could facilitate ANALYSIS revision of the syllabus if the statement comes to grips with the main problems of CCA, The obvious complaint, of course, is that 2,400 years is just a bit too much to span in one year. A concomitant problem is that of placing men, ideas, and events in-to some sort of historical context. All too often a student learns a fact or an idea without even a superficial understanding of the contemporary social conditions or intellectual climate which produced it. The documentary approach to CCA embodied in the sourcebooks does not help matters. The readings, often poorly translated or written in obsolete .English, stand in all their starkness on the pages -of Sources ready to stifle interest, break concentration, stimulate boredom, and finally induce slumber. Abandonment of the source books in favor of a series of paperback editions, as is currently used in Humanities A, is the obvious way to alleviate this problem. Other paperbacks could provide general chronologies of events and times, which would bring to the course the continuity and cohesiveness it now lacks. Associate Professor of History orest Ranum, chairman of the CC program, estimates that the set of paperbacks would cost about the same as the Humanities books do. One of the main arguments, strangely enough, against shelving the Sources, Professor Ranum stated recently, is the added expense* it would be to students. The difference in price between current CC texts and the cost of a set of paperbacks would probably amount to no more than six dollars per term —hardly a sum to break most students at Columbia. Since Professor Ranum assumed the chairmanship of CC, several paperbacks have been added to the syllabus as supplementary reading to enliven the source ma-terial and to place ideas and events into historical context. Indeed some CC sections cover the period known as the ""century of revolution,"" from 1 7 89 to 1889, primarily through paperback books. Students, of course, cannot be expected to do the extensive reading needed to enable them to see ideas in historical context over a period of 2,400 years. Therefore, for the sake of continuity and historical context, it seems that drastic changes in the basic approach, with possible reversion to the original intent of the course, are needed. CC evolved from a War Issues course given during World War I. The College announcement for 1919-20 stated the purpose of the course in the following manner: ""The aim of the course is to inform the student of the more out- ' standing and influential factors of his physical and social environment. The chief features of the intellectual, economic, and political life of today are treated and considered in their dependence, on and difference from the past. By thus giving the student objective material on which to base his own judgment, it is thought he will be aided in an intelligent participation in the civilization of his own day."" This course went right up to contemporary times. The current course, as now structured, has yet to get past the First World War. Indeed some instructors must be surprised to find the course goes so far. A keystone of the course at that time was ""relevance"" to the problems and real issues of the day. This raises another criticism that is frequently made against thecourse. Some students complain that a good deal of the material— for example, the religious writers of the Middle Ages—is not ""relevant"" to their lives. In other words, Contemporary Civilization is simply not contemporary enough. The CCA staff must decide this weekend whether to continue teaching everything—hoping that the students will retain some of the ideas with which they come into contact and will come away with a vague, nebulous comprehension of the development of Western thought—or to teach a revamped course dealing more intensely with a much shorter and more recent time period and with ideas exerting influence on the is sues of today. Professor Ranum said last week .that ""the eagerness for revision among staff members springs from the state of the nation."" The racial strife in America and the war in Vietnam, he explained, have made the CC instructors askthemselves, ""what are we teaching these stu' dents?"" Thus it seems that ""relevance"" may become one of the foci of the discussion at Arden House in Harriman, N.Y. If the case for relevance prevails this weekend, next year's freshmen may start CC in the early seventeenth century. It is hard, however, to imagine CC purged of the ancient Greeks and Romans, Augustine, Aquinas and many others. This fact points up a difficulty inherent in the forthcoming discussions. Namely, how are thirty faculty members from six different disciplines and a handful of students with various fields of interest going to agree to banish any of the readings? Nevertheless, some changes will probably be made. The extreme, as outlined above, is a possibility but not a probability. Most likely, some type of compromise will be worked out in revising the syllabus.Professor Ranum has said that since the new statement of purpose would be given out during Freshman Week, it is imperative— if CC is to become a more integrated whole —that the discussions yield a consensus on the course's emphasis and direction. And it seems that an emphasis on placing ideas and events in historical context would lessen student bewilderment and bring a much needed continuity to that ""most rewarding experience,"" CC.Orest Ranum"

199,The Joint College Commission Report Preface,28 October 1968,"PrefaceThe Joint College Commission is a group of six Columbia College students and six faculty members who were, on May 14, 1968, invited by the Committee on Instruction of the College to form a working party to ""formulate specific, constructive recommendations for change; and to suggest mechanisms necessary for proposing change in the future."" The Commission was directed to present its proposals for consideration by both the Faculty and student body of the College—an unusual procedure and mandate prompted by extraordinary circumstances. Our terms of reference were at once broad (any concern of the College could be ours), and limited (to the College itself, notwithstanding the many repercussions of the College's position as a constituent of the whole University). The focus of our inquiry has therefore been on those matters in which the College can, and should, act as a self-governing community of faculty and students, with its own autonomously defined educational purposes and aspirations. The proposals we offer are intended to make the College better able to define, review, and, where necessary, change its policies; to provide maximum educational opportunities for its members; and to strengthen the spirit of self-deter-mination and self-government in the College, both as a community and as an educational institution. We have also suggested some changes in the relationship of the College to the larger community outside it, which could, we believe, be of benefit to both. We have not limited ourselves to those issues which have figured prominently in recent times or which have been loudly proclaimed as the source of recent troubles and disorders; nor have we shied away from issues, academic as well as non-academic, which have received time-honored and even learned examination. If we have interpreted the mood of today correctly, we feelieve there is now an opportunity to re-explore many of the unresolved problems of the past in a new spirit of enterprise. Measured by the yardstick of what has actually happened, much of what may once have appeared impracticable or even impossible now lies in the domain of the eminently feasible and even desirable. Our concern therefore has not been so much to restore the College to 'normal' operation after the recent disruptions, as to explore reforms and improvements which, if implemented, will make further upheavals, less necessary. There is no single or common purpose which embraces the diverse interests, aims, and ambitions of all students of Columbia College. Each student may view the opportunities the College has to offer him in his own individual way. This diversity is no weakness of the College; it is its strength. Individuality of purpose is a measure of the quality of a student body, and the educational practices of Columbia should be of a quality to match. To provide the fullest opportunity for individual intellectual development and personal expression, with the greatest freedom of style and method is, we believe, the main function of the College. If this purpose is to be served in a College ■of some three thousand students, there must be coherence within it and cooperation among its members, since the College is both an institution and a society. The basis of this cooperation must be respect for individual integrity, not denial of it; organizational coherence must aim at the most effective (not necessarily the most convenient) use of the resources of the College (and University). All students and faculty should, we believe, accept these basic principles.""the College should act as a selfgoverning community of faculty and students ...""One of our first proposals is for machinery to enable students to express and promote their common interests, and to establish a basis for the regulation of their own affairs and for cooperation with Faculty and Administration in the direction and regulation of all the affairs of the College. To preserve both freedom and opportunity in the com-munity-within-a-community that is the College, rules and standards of conduct have to be established and observed. This is primarily a matter for the members of the community themselves; their task is both to establish the rules and to ensure respect for them. But College rules should not include, explicitly or implicitly , any attempt to define for students' standards of private moral or personal behavior. It is to establish a clear demarcation between the domains of personal independence and College authority that we have both the principles and the practices that should be satisfied by any regulation or piece of legislation affecting student life and conduct. If many of our suggestions appear peripheral to the primary role of the College (and University) as a place of education, scholarship, and research, this should not be taken to imply thsfc the College is to be deflected from its prime functions, but rather that it will be better able to serve them. Improvement of educational opportunities is clearly a matter demanding the widest participationby both faculty and students. We have indicated several places where improvement is felt to be urgently needed. We have also made suggestions which, we believe, will afford individual initiative wider opportunities without reducing those that already exist. In connection with academic objectives we cannot ignore one fiercely debated and now prominent issue: the moral implications of the College's educational policies and practices. To escape this by a declaration of amorality would be both unworthy and unnecessary. The moral issue is, we believe, quite clear. While indifference to moral values cannot be the policy of the College, neither is direct, explicit expression of moral purpose its primary concern. In its domestic affairs the guiding principle, as stated above, is respect for personal freedom, initiative, and integrity. This same principle provides proper criteria to apply to those purposes outside the College which its activities may serve. Without doubt, then, the College should not lend its name or resources to any activities which may outrage the moral sensibilities of a significant proportion of its members. To define these may be difficult, and at times impossible; to ignore them will at all times be unpardonable, and eventually disastrous. We wish to emphasize that our suggestions are not intended as final, comprehensive plans. Their purpose is to initiate discussion and expedite decision. It is in this spirit that they are respectfully submitted to the College community. Jeffrey C. Bush Graham W. Irwin Samuel Devons Alan Sparer Carl F. Hovde Samuel Coleman William H. Reinmuth Oliver L. Henry William R. Carey, Jr. Gregory H.C. Knox Eugene Galanter Richard Wetzel Columbia College October 14, 1968 Undvrgraduate Association Of Columbia College We present first a proposal for an undergraduate or ganization, to be known as the ""Undergraduate Association of Columbia College"" (UACC), through which students can participate in the discussion ©f, and decision-making for, all aspects of College life: admissions, curriculum, course and teacher evaluation, the advisory system, student activities and housing, and discipline. The UACC will also have restraining power on changes voted by Faculty or instituted by Administration. It will participate in University government. Structure The UACC should consist of every enrolled member of Columbia College. To an Executive Board (EB) of the UACC should be delegated the actual work of the UACC as its representatives. The EB shall include: Three delegates selected from the freshman class, Three delegates selected from the sophomore class, Four delegates selected from the junior class, Four delegates selected from the senior class, Four delegates at large. There shall be five standing sub-committees on the EB as follows: (1) Student Activities Sub-committee; members hip to include The Board of Managers, Citizenship Council, King's Crown Activities, representatives from Athletic activities, etc., and members of the EB. (2) Student Board and Housing Sub-committee; membership to include representatives from the Undergraduate Dormitory Council, Pamphratria, and members of the EB. (3) Academic Affairs Sub-committee; membership to consist of the Academic Affairs Committee (see below) and members of the EB. (4) Student Advisory Sub-committee; membership to consist of the Student Advisory Committee (see below). (5) College and University Policy Sub-committee; membership to include the elected class residents and members of the EB. The UACC shall have the right to form ad hoc and standing committees to meet problems it deems worthy of investigation and report, e.g., expansion, community relations, etc. Procedures The EB shall be responsive to the UACC in general, holding referenda and open meetings whenever these may be deemed advisable for ascertaining student opinion on matters of College policy. A regular schedule of meetings of the EB shall be announced at the beginning of the academic year and such meetings shall be open to any members of the UACC. Any member of the UACC may present a proposal and participate in the discussions of the EB at this time, though only elected delegates may vote on specific recommendations. A majority vote of the entire UACC shall override any action or decision of its EB. Such a vote may be called for by the same numbers needed to convene (see next paragraph) or by five members of the EB.The members of the UACC may be convened either by their EB or on the petition of 10% of its members. Specific class constituencies may be convened either by their delegates or on the petition of any 10% of such constituency. At this time a constituency may instruct its delegates as to its position on any issue before the EB. Method of Election Class representatives shall be chosen by ballot vote in the following manner: Freshmen will vote for 2 Sophomores will vote for 2 Juniors will vote for 3 Seniors will vote for 3 The at large delegates shall be chosen by ballot vote in the following manner: Sophomores will vote for 2 Juniors will vote for 2 Seniors will vote for 2""..♦the College should not lend its name or resources to any activities which may outrage the moral sensibilities of a sig* nificant proportion of its mem* hers.""There can be any number of candidates running for the specific number or class representatives with the proviso that they obtain 50 signatures on a petition of nomination. Those candidates with the largest number of votes will be declared the winners, with no vote gradations or point systems used in ballot tabulations. Tie votes shall be run off in a special election using the above procedure omitting petitions. The EB shall nominate at least two of its members as candidates for the offices of President, Vice-President, and Secretary-Treasurer of the UACC. The entire student body (UACC) will then cast votes for these offices. At the end of April (at the end of October for the freshman class), elections for representatives and executive officers shall be held in the manner set out above. Activities and departmental representatives of the various sub-committees shall be chosen at this time in any manner the said activities choose. The new UACC representatives and execut"" vei officers shall take office in the beginning of the next fajl term. Any representative may run for re-election. NOTE: Elections for the academic year of 1968-69 should be held as early as possible in October or November of 1968. After these elections the executive officers will be elected by the EB rather than the UACC for this one year only. Duties and Responsibilities /. College Policy: The EB shall be responsible for ascertaining and communicating to the University the position of the College student body on any matter of interest to it, and shall be free to recommend new College policies or changes in existing College policy. Its powers in these matters shall include the following: (a) To select representatives of the College student body to serve on College-wide or University-wide bodies; such selection to be accomplished, depending on the nature of the body, by delegation of its own members or by administration of College-wde elections in which such representatives shall be chosen. (b) To introduce in the form of resolutions to the College Faculty at its regularly scheduled meetings new College policies or changes in existing College policy. (c) In the case of enactment of any new College policy or in existing policy, to delay the implementation of such enactment until its approval or reapproval by the College Faculty at its next regular meeting and to present at that meeting the case against enactment. (d) To delegate from its membership observers to the College Faculty meeting. //. Academic Policy (a) The UACC may participate in Academic policymaking through its Academic Affairs Committee which will be constituted in the manner outlined under the Academic Representation proposal. (b) Students may express their opinions and attitudes regarding the quality of instruction and course offerings specifically through mechanisms enumerated in the Advisory System reform proposal. ///. Student Activities Through the Student Activities Sub-committee the EB shall study and discuss College extra-curricular activities with the office of Student Activities and the College Dean's office, and shall regulate any of these activities that it deems necessary or desirable. / V. Student Board and Housing Through its Student Board and Housing sub-committee the EB shall investigate these matters. After discussionwith the Dean's office and the proper administrators and upon completion of research, it may assume administrative control and regulation over those areas that it deems necessary or desirable. Finance The EB of the UACC shall have the right to levy a tax on its constituency to meet its financial needs. The EB shall propose a yearly or term budget which must be approved by a majority of the UACC, and be subject to responsible audit. Amendments to UACC Regulations The regulations governing the UACC may be amended by a two-thirds majority vote of the membership of the UACC.The Faculty"
200,"Students, Teachers Gain Greater Voice In Humanities A Classes Free to Select Syllabus for 6 Weeks",25 November 1968,"Classes Free to Select Syllabus for 6 WeeksA major revision is the formal of the second semester of first-, year Humanities, which will allow individual instructors to select their own readings during the last six weeks of the term, has been approved by the College Committee v on Instruction. According to Professor of French Donald Frame, chairman of the Humanities A program, each instructor this spring will have the option of consulting with his students in determining a syllabus for the six-week period. The reasons for the change, Professor Frame stated .Friday, were staff dissatisfaction with the current syllabus and the difficulty the staff had in agreeing on new readings. He alsocited a desire on the part of many of the Humanities instructors to recreate the conditions of last spring after the deomonstra-' tions, when students and faculty together decided on what they would study. Professor Frame emphasized that the program was experimental and that each instructor will be asked to submit a thorough report and justification of his selections to the other members of the staff. The change in the syllabus will mean that Cervantes, Milton, Spinoza, Descartes, Moliere, Swift, Blake and Dostoyevski will no longer be mandatory reading. Professor Frame stated, however, that' he expects that many faculty mem-bers will continue to assign these authors. i Although some of the staff mem,bers contacted last night did not approve of the new program, the general reaction was favorable. The consensus was that the new arrangement will probably enable the faculty to better evaluate the possibilities for future reading lists. Most of the instructors felt that they would play a major part in the selection of reading material, but will submit their choices to the approval of the students. Morris Dickstein, assistant professor of English, said he envisioned a ""guided democracy"" in his classes, with students helping to select readings from various suggestions made by him."
201,Tutorials for Freshmen Proposed,5 December 1968,"By JOHN KOUTSOSOne exception to the generally apathetic reaction accorded the Joint College Commission's report has been the activity of the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee. Two weeks ago, the' committee divided itself into five subcommittees toexamine and evaluate five recommendations made in the JCC report.News FeatureOne of these subcommittees, headed by Alan Sparer '69, has completed most of its research and will next week present a-proposal to the College Committee on Instruction for the institution next semester of optional tutorials for freshmen. Although the details of the proposal have not been finalized, the report will recommend the formation of small groups of four or five freshmen and one teacher tostudy one specific topic in depth. Sparer said this week that specific topics would not be predetermined, but would be worked out between each teacher and his students. He explained that the field of competence of each tutorial leader would be announced, and any student interested in this general area would apply to the tutorial. The program would be instituted this spring on an experimental basis for approximately fifty students. Sparer is currently in the process of finding volunteers to lead the tutorials from among faculty members, faculty fellows, and seniors in the College. A faculty fellow is a graduate student who receives a four year fellowship from Columbia in return for teaching or rendering the department in which he is studying some other service in his third or fourth year of graduate study.The proposal Sparer will present will probably ask that students receive two or three points of credit for the tutorials. Although it is ""hard to predict how the Committee on Instruction will react to the proposal,"" Robert K. Belknap, associate dean for student affairs, commented yesterday, ""the stickiest point will probably be the giving of credit for courses conducted by men who do not hold AB degrees."" Even if the Committee on Instruction does rule out teaching by seniors, the proposal still can be implemented on a more limited baj>is. The advantages of such a program could be numerous. The most obvious benefit would be that some freshmen will be given an opportunity to do carefully supervised intensive study in a restricted area, which would serve as an introduction to serious scholarship in the student's first yearat Columbia. Often this introduction never comes until a student's senior year in a seminar. Another advantage would be the bringing together into intimate groups students who share a common intellectual interest. This common interest could result in intellectual sub-groupings in which the students could find academic roots in th College. In many disciplines such intellectual groupings never occur. In addition, freshman tutorials could prove an exceptionally beneficial use of faculty fellows. The number of faculty fellows has been increasing rapidly, and the full effect of this increase should be felt by the College in a year or two. Currently most faculty fellows are laboratory instructors, recitation leaders, or examination readers and graders. Last year many College administrators indicated that an increase in faculty fellows might lead to an influx of graduate students teaching such courses as Contemporary Civilization and Humanities A. As Dean Belknap pointed out, the idea behind faculty fellowships ""is to find money which can dodouble duty."" That is, to find funds that can finance graduate study and teaching simultaneously. It would seem then that freshman tutorials might help alleviate the problem. The program would prevent graduate student teaching in courses which require knowledge, experience, and continuity such as CCA, but would enable them to be used productively in tutorials in their own fields of specialization. The use of faculty fellows, however, does not rule out participation by faculty members. Other advantages to the tutorials, such as the possible elimination of English A, may be found next spring if the Committee on Instruction approves the experiment. Since all the teachers will be ""volunteers"", and the financial cost of the program to the College will be minimal, it seems that an experiment involving a limited number of students might set a precedent for further experimentation as well as building a permanent program which could considerably enrich what many critics have called an inflexible first-year program at Columbia.Robert L. Belknap"
202,Spring CCA Syllabus Revamped,8 January 1969,"By JEFFREY ARSHAMThe syllabus for thespringterm of first-year Contemporary Civilization was released yesterday after several months of mild controversy about the study of revolutions. Last spring the CCA staff revamped the entire required course, dropping the traditional survey approach, and designing a sec6nd semester which would concentrate on the study of revolutions. This fall a tentative syllabus was drafted, but was criticized by several prominent faculty members for over-emphasizing revolution. The new syllabus released yesterday, however, is substantially the same in format as the one proposed last spring. The syllabus is organized into four major topics: the Enlightenment and French Revolution, 1848 and the industrial revolution, the Russian Revolution, and ""Crisis in Values."" The final section is an outgrowth of the topic ""Identity Crises,"" proposed last spring, which, according to Professor Joseph Rothschild, chariman of the CC program, was ""held by many CCA instructors to be not sufficiently rigorous."" Among the authors that have been eliminated from this section were Malcolm X and Lenny Bruce.Charles Nadler, an instructor in philosophy, suggested last night that in repsonse to criticism, the section on ""crisis and values* was added in order to ""balance the sequence."" The three sections on revolution are ""now supplemented by a section on intellectual thought,"" he said. The new reading list includes readings from Rousseau, Marx, Smith, Lenin, Nietzsche, Durkheim, and Freud, as well as secondary material by such contemporary writers as Erik Erikson and Fritz Stern. Among the authors who are no longer required reading are Weber, Malthus, Darwin, and Hegel. The fall syllabus, which according to Professor Rothschild will be evaluated in the coming months, eliminated all previously required readings prior to the Reformation. None of the opponents of the proposed study of revolutions wished to comment last night on the new syllabus. According toProfessor Rothschild, all instructors will adhere to the ""uniform, reading list."" The Humanities A program recently reduced the; number of required readings for the spring semester and left the choice of the remaining readings to the individual instructors and their sections. In anticipation of disagreements over the new syllabus Professor Rothschild asserted that ""no matter how we organize the course, some crucial readings will be omitted, but the resultant costs are less than the pedagogic costs of allowing each instructor to determine his own syllabus."" Professor Rothschild said that he hopes the course, which has been in a state of ""experimental transition"" for several years, will ""run for 3 to 4 years* in its new format. He stated that if certain readings were widely found to be ""unsuccessful,"" they could be replaced."
203,Freshman Course Revision Sought,9 January 1969,"By JOHN KOUTSOSProfessor of English Quentin Anderson has circulated aproposal which calls for the replacement of Humanities A, Contemporary Civilization A, and English A with a single freshman seminar concentrating on one of such varied topics as northern European Renaissance painting or urban transport. Under the proposal, copies of which were distributed to College faculty members shortly before the Christmas vacation, twelve students would form a section which would be taught by two non-tenured members of the staff. Each section would also be under the supervision of a tenure faculty member. Professor Anderson said yesterday that his plan calls for a College faculty committee to choose which topics would be discussed in each section. Each student, he said, could choose the section he wished to enter. Professor Anderson said yesterday he plans to submit the proposal, which advocates the establishment of five or six experimental sections, to the Committee on Instruction within a few weeks. He said that if the proposal were not killed in the committee, he would hope to have it discussed at a College faculty meeting. Professor Anderson remarked that he made the recommendation because he felt that ""the general education program in the College is dying,"" and that the staffs of CCA and Humanities A have lost firm direction and a sense of what should be imparted by the respective courses. He stated that his proposed course would seek ""to preserve not the common experience ofI Humanities A or CCA, but a com- ! mon emphasis on responsible in- ) quiry, methodological rigor, and ] inclusive treatment leading to at | least a modest mastery on the part of the student."" The proposed course, Professor Anderson commented, "" reflects I the notion of the freshman semI inar,"" which may be instituted experimentally next term as a supplement to CC and Humanities. ""The course,"" he added, ""is com- ; parable to the one term course now ! given in English as a substitute i for English A."" Professor Anderson said that while he realizes that ""curricular changes do not make new teachers ! or new students, the changes may | redirect energies, or release en- | ergies which have been bottled up i or deflected.""A random sampling of faculty opinion of the proposal last night revealed varied degrees of enthusiasm. Professor of Comparative Literature Joseph Mazzeo said he agreed with Professor Anderson's judgment. Professor of French Donald Frame, chairman of Humanities A, said he feared 'fragmentation"" caused by having each group of twelve students studying separate topics.Quentin Anderson"
204,On recreating the collegiate character of Columbia College,11 February 1969,"by QUENTIN ANDERSONDoes the deterioration of Columbia's general education courses threaten the coherence and identity of the College? The author fears that it does, and proposes a new ""common course"" which would abandon the attempt to provide freshmen with a rounded dose of Western culture, in favor of an effort to inculcate in them certain principles and habits of intellectual rigor. Mr. Anderson is a professor of English in the College, and has taught or served as chairman of the Humanities and English A programs and the Colloquium on Important Books for many years. Aside from the second year courses in music and art which have always been departmeritally staffed, the general education program jn the College is dying. Humanities; Contemporary Civilization and the Colloquium'are all in a bad way. No malign agency is at work herej the staff now engaged in teaching these courses simply does not any longer believe in their original intention, and their failure to give it credit stems from the fact that the courses as they have long been conceived do not in fact answer our most pressing educational needs. (The Contemporary Civilization staff has made its unease known by prescribing what I would describe as an intellectually vulgar revision of its second term, and the Humanities staff has voted to abrogate its collective responsibility for the second half of the second term. The logical recourse is the Committee on Instruction, but it must be recognized that that committee has become the servant of so many imposed tasks, departmental offerings, budget, foreign relations, crisis management, promotions and so forth, that it finds it hard to find time to think about anything not imposed by day to day urgencies. We probably need a College planning committee.) What this means to the College at large is that those programs which were its binding sinews have dried up, and that the departments are all. I don't believe that we can blame the institution of the departmental majors for this situation; that was enforced by the pressures of professional concern both within and without the College. But to go on pretending that we have a going general education program will do great harm, and will do it soon. We must reconsider our curriculum, the shared portion of our curriculum, and make the drastic kind of change required. (I don't mean to rule out the possibility of other kinds of curricular change for the later years.) All the proposals so far made are but tinkering, and none of them will recreate the horizontal structures in the College which are needed to make it once more a shared enterprise on the part of the departments which now contribute to the staffing of the general education courses. I assume that the three ends of undergraduate instruction proposed by Daniel Bell are primary: that an intelligible program fosters historical awareness, methodological awareness, and selfawareness. I add a fourth presumption: that the temporal dimension assumed by Professor Bell's book is erroneous; there is no such thing as a four year college at the present time, and it is even more important that there are few able students who are prepared to wait, to stand and wait, intellectually speaking, while we march the western past and the western classics in review. This worked well earlier, and I thing that for those who had the experience it was in some ways better than what I wish to propose. But it is no longer a viable affair. Our present situation dictates movingthe most ""general"" of our courses back to where they came from, the junior and senior years. What must be general about the first (or in some cases, the second) year is an emphasis on'method, and rigorous demands on the student as writer, reader and thinker. The implicit demand of many of our best entering students and many of the younger members of our staff is: why a college at all? Since we find it hard to credit the institutions and the proclaimed values of the larger society, why should we credit this one? The only way to answer this question properly isat the outset, and very firmly indeed. What we have to o ';'or is what a colleague calls ""rational aui'.'ority,"" the authority that arises out of knowing more, and being more skilled in teaching what we know than anyone the youngester has heretofore encountered. To wait is to fritter away priceless readiness, and to make sure that only the odd student will in the end really come to grips with what we have to offer in the senior seminar. A number of our colleagues are prepared to sympathize with the impulse of youth to shed roles; they are ready to shed their roles, and since theseyounger faculty and graduate students must be given a firm sense of .rational authority; the graduate school must learn to make the undergraduate teaching of their students to serve the ends of education on both sides of the street. These are very general aims, to show the entering student very clearly and without delay what it is that differentiates the college from the society, and to see that those who teach him are busy at the same job. They depend on a particular conclusion: the college which fitted into the career aspirations of its students, which was by and large smoothly articulated with that society— never, happily, completely so—was a different institution, not the institution we now require. The college we can now defend must be a school we are literally prepared to defend from its opening day, not with rules and sanctions but with all the scholarly and critical authority we can muster.A Pilot ProgramAlthough my overall intention is to supplart Humanities A, Contemporary Civilization and English A with a single new course, I wish initially to propose the institution of only five or six sections of that new course, chosen as a profile of the entering class. I assume sections of twelve men, each to be taught by two members of the staff, and eachof which is under the supervision of a tenure member. Each section is to deal with only one topic per year; topics would be chosen with a view to the possibility of responsible inquiry on the part of entering students, and are to be treated as fully as the limits of time and linguistic competence permit. Some possible topics: The City in the 19th Century and After; Evolutionary Thought in Victorian England; Art Nouveau and Its Interpreters; John Dewey and American Schools; The History of Biology. I wish to avoid the smell of an honors program, and take the bold position which the College has long taken that Columbia College is itself an honors program. The scheme obviously reflects the notion of the freshman seminar, and is comparable to the one term course now given in English as a substitute for English A, English 1003. This latter course deals intensively with a single work and entails historical and critical reading about it. My scheme extrapolates the notion of the'freshman seminar in a direction suggested by Professor Beers' famous course at Harvard, and seeks to pre-serve not the common experience of Humanities A or Contemporary Civilization, but a common emphasis on responsible inquiry, methodological rigor, and inclusive treatment leading to at least a modest mastery on the part of the student. Whether he is dealing with urban transport, ""Ulysses,"" or painters of the northern Renaissance, he ought never after be able to say that he hasn't had the experience of disciplined inquiry. I would like to avoid fancy names. Let us call it provisionally, ""the common course,"" and consider how it might work. Curricular changes don't makf new teachers or new students; they nia.\ redirect energies, or release energies which have been bottled up or deflected. When Humanities A was instituted it released energies in a notable way; senior men who had not been doing this sort of thing found great rewards in teaching the course, and many stayed with it for a long period. This was true of Contemporary Civilization as well. (The elements in the intellectual atmosphere which fostered these courses were the new history and a diffusion of Marxist ideas in the case of Contemporary Civilization, and Erskine's enterprise of reading the classics, ""a first reading,"" which involved the exciting task of being a gentleman amateur about a wide range of western accomplishment, in company with .an equally interested colleague witha 'different background. In both cases the courses that evolved turned out to be rather better than their inciting ideas, which were after all not very impressive.) Are there energies to be released here, and what channels are we creating for them in setting up our common course? Perhaps before we ask the question I should be frank about my version of the situation in which we in the College find ourselves. The affair of last spring may have provoked many people to brilliant exercises in self-definition; but if so, they have not taken the further step, ncbody has been provoked to a fresh attempt at corporate self-definition. Our recreant colleagues have been heard from in the ""Atlantic"" proclaiming the university as ""experience center,"" and calling up the ghost of Black Mountain College. And we continue to be faced by a pervasive emotion in our students, which has up to this point been associated with a style of thought which can only be called feeble, when it is not simply mendacious. We all empathize with the emotion; our fourth wall is down, and we somehow flow toward their feelings without sharing for the most part their ideas. Our intellects are still wearing white arm bands, and the task of contriving an institutionally viable response which can take an institutional form seems beyond us. But if there is an institution worth defending our conception of its educational ends will simply have to take an institutional form. To return to my question: what might we reasonably hope for if we instituted this pilot program'? We should be frankly discarding what we have found so appealing in the past, the gentlemanly, the justifiably amateurish, stage in the undergraduate education we provide. We should be getting down to the brass tacks of logic, clear writing, responsible reading, demonstrated comprehension, at the outset. An instance may help: my Humanities section had spent two hours on Arisotle's Ethics; we went on to Lucretius, and they then suggested that we return to Aristotle. I spent an hour and a half on three paragraphs in Book VI of the Ethics, and one of my students then remarked that it was clear that he simply had not read what he thought he had read. Now this kind of reading is' not what Humanities A aims at, and to devote most of one's time to it would be to give another course altogether. But the contrast is plain. If we are effectually the lone institution, and musf, on pain of losing their allegiance, make our students citizens of the community of learning, we had better not operate any longer with the assumption that we are training the elite of an existing society outside. It had better be brass tacks to begin with. The sections of twelve mentioned above might meet as many as twelve hours a week, and they would regularly skip a week or two altogether in order to do an extensive piece of reading, towork on reports, to prepare for the oral presentation of a question. The senior member of the staff, who ideally might be both interested in undergraduate education and involved in the graduate program of one of the two- graduate studentteachers would be expected to participate in two or three class meetings per term, to make his specialized training available to the teachers, or the group of teachers who were dealing with the same topic. The handling of the first text in the first three week session would set the scene and generate the atmosphere which would thereafter prevail. Every oldfashioned technique of explication would be employed, and we would have to muster a holy zeal to do it properly. Precis, dissection of paragraphs, search for key terms, smoking out presumptions, dealing with the articulation of chapters with one another, description of the overallstrategy of the text, all to be carried on with the greatest measure of responsibility in spoken and written discourse that is practicable. Full opportunity for the expression of differences in interpretation, but everyone to be held to the standard of responsible statement. We might choose the second text with a view tQ its contrasting presumptions. If the first three week period was exhausted by consideration of the first text the assignment for the two week interregnum would be the attempt to handle the second text as the first had been handled—only all by yourself, with such conferences as you felt you wanted. The second three week period would presumably move somewhat faster with the second text. During the course of that period the supervisor might enter on the scene. A lecture and a discussion hour would begin to set the stage for a larger view of the topic to which the first two texts referred. The students would choose themes for oral reports at the end of this second three week period. And the subsequent interregnum would be devoted to the reading and planning necessary to prepare those reports. The third three weeks of the first term would vary the presentation of reports with the planned appearances of the supervisor, or with attendance at his lectures addressed to all the sections dealing with his topic. At the end of this third period of three weeks the student would opt for his particular choice of theme for an extended piece of work on which he is to be busy well into the next term. I won't attempt a full description of that term, but I would like the notion of having the graduate students involved in a single topic interchange classes during that period, and I would also like to consider having them present a thesis of their own at a session run ""by the supervisor. Finally, I suggest oral examinations at the end of the second term. Ideally, we would stipulate that the graduate department in which the prentice teachers were working must be, prepared to"
205,Humanities A: An Experiment in Free Will,10 March 1969,"By JON GRONERA small but possibly significant reform took place in November when the College Committee on Instruction approved an experimental the Humanities A course, permitting instructors to consult with their classes on the works to be read in the last six weeks of the second semester. Previously, the compulsory sequence was based on a common reading list, covering literary works from Homer to Dostoyevski. During the first few weeks of the current semester, however, instructors conferred with their students and tried to put into effect the ideals of democracy and student participation. During the strike last springthis ideal of student participation was approximated as many classes were held on an informal basis on lawns and in professors' apartments. The desire to recreatethe conditions and spirit of the liberation classes was cited as one of the reasons for adopting the new Humanities A policy. Other reasons were more academic. The second semester of Humanities A has generally been considered less unified and less coherent than the first semester, which has always heen a standard introduction to classical literature from Homer to Vergil. The second semester syllabus formerly covered a spreadof authors from Cervantes, to Milton, to Spinoza to Blake. The idea of student participation intrigued many students when the new plan was first announced. Some envisioned humanities classes as a place to readanddiscuss Eldridge Cleaver, JamesBond, and the writings of MaoTsetung. But these ideas have not been realized; the proviso that all suggested readings must be approved by the Humanities A staff effectively insured some continuity with the ""Iliad"" and the ""Odyssey"". The list of selections that have been made reveals that a surprising number of the works on the old reading list have been retained despite participatory democracy. Michael Rosenthal, assistant professor of English, explained last week that students are familiar by reputation with great works and ""know what is considered good literature."" He said that the stu-dent selections reveal very little ""frivolity."" Instructors were allowed to use their discretion in determining the extent of student participation in the planning of the syllabus. Ap- \ roaches ranged from the ' total democracy"" used by Professor Rosenthal and Assistant Professor of English Robert Osborn to a more limited system of ' '.guided democracy,"" where the instructor maintained a greater role. Professor Osborn's reading list, for example, includes such works as Goethe's ' Faust,"" T. S.Eliot's ""The Wasteland"", Dostoyevski's ""Notes from Underground,"" and Herman Hesse's ""Steppenwolf."" Several professors had reservations about the experiment. Donald Frame, professor of French and chairman of the Humanities A staff, said last week that he personally favors the standard reading list used in previous years, ""The common reading list gave a feeling of unity to the course, since everyone taking Humanities A was reading the same work at the same time. The experiment in effect breaks the course up into many smaller courses,"" he noted. Professor Frame, however, said he found some advantages to the new system. He remarked that ""some very interesting things"" would be tried out since each instructor could propose teaching the works he knows best. Many professors took advantageof the experiment in just this way, suggesting works in which they had a special interest. James VV. Forrester, assistant professor of philosophy, said that his section is restricting itself to the study of eighteenth-century England. Professor Forrester said last week, ""The second semester last had no unity at all, so I am using this experiment to give it unity. Of course, the disadvantage is that the greatest works may not be read, but the greatest works are not always relevant to each other."" Carl E. Hester, instructor of religion, felt that the idea of the .experiment is ""a good one"" but that there are several drawbacks. He pointed out specifically the ""subjectivity"" resulting fromfree choice in each section and the possible ""misuse"" of student con-sultation. ""If the students haven't already read the works, they can't be fair judges, and if they have read them,"" he said. Nathan Gross, assistant professor of French, recently took note of some of the paradoxes resulting from the experiment. He claimed to have been democratic in consulting his class, but said that ""the class approved my choices."" He added he felt the old reading list was ""just grand"" but that, ""After all, it is an experiment, and one must take part."" The experiment in Humanities A will begin during the second week in April, traditionally a season of change at Columbia. Whether it will be successfully completed this spring or whether it will paradoxically become a casualty of events, like those that gave it birth, is still unknown.Donald Frame"
206,Hovde to Release Pass-Fail Plan For Basic Freshman Courses,14 April 1969,"By MARTIN FLUMENBAUMThe College Committee on Instruction has recommended that students enrolled in almost all of the required degree courses next year receive a grade of either pass or fail. The proposal, if approved by the College faculty later this month, would place virtually the entire freshman year on a mandatory pass-fail basis. In a statement prepared for release today, Dean Carl F. Hovde said that the plan combines ""thepossible virtues of the pass-fail system"" with the committee's conviction ""that students must be carefully evaluated by their teachers."" The' one-year pass-fail plan would include the three basic freshman year courses —Humanities A, English composition and Contemporary Civilization A—as well as all introductory language courses, art humanities, and music humanities. In addition, the committee re-commended that five year-long ""poet's"" sciences coursesastronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics—be included in the grading experiment. Any two of these five courses can fulfill the current math-science requirement. The entire experimental plan is subject to review after one year. The eleven-man committee also suggested three alternatives for evaluating student performance in the mandatory pass-fail course. First, instructors could indicate the performance of any student working below C level at midterms. A second option would be to submit letter grades at the end of each semester to the Dean's Office, with the understanding that they would not appear on the student's permanent record. Third, for those faculty members who think that even unrecorded grading impedes proper learning, the committee proposed that instructors complete questionnaires at the end of the semester evaluating their students. The questionnaire could rate each student on his class attendance; the amount of readingcompieted before class discussions; overall command and control of the materials and techniques of the course; written performance in class; and participation in class discussion. A typical set of evaluations used on the committee's sample questionnaire listed the following gradations in performance: ""suberb, fine, solid, adequate, and inadequate."" The instructor is also asked to evaluate term papers and judge the student's ability to ""make testable formulations"" and ""marshal an argument."" The instructor can also recommend a student for academic awards, tutoring, or even psychiatric help. Dean Hovde stated that there are two major reasons why the committee's proposal focuses on the freshman year. ""Students entering selective colleges have for many years been under pressure to collect as many good grades as possible,"" the Dean said. ""It may prove to be true that a first year without publicly recorded fi-experiment primarily because letter grades in the courses were thought necessary for medical and graduate school applications.^, The Committee on Instruction is the College's academic de-cision-making body, and must approve all curricular and grading reforms. A faculty smoker will .be held April 21-to discuss the proposal. Later this month the College faculty will meet to make a final decision. Under the College's current pass-fail option, instituted in September 1967, a student may register for pass-fail credit for only one non-required course per semester. If the proposal is approved by the faculty, however, freshmen or sophomores who take mandatory pass-fail courses will not be permitted to use the regular passfail option. At the request of the Human •Development staff, the Committee "" on Instruction also recommended that all courses in that department be graded on a pass-fail b,asis.nal grades will make students more comfortable without reducing the will to work."" He also remarked that ""passfail entries for the first year will not prejudice our students in their applications to graduate school."" The proposal omits introductory science courses required for majors in chemistry, psychology, mathematics and physics. These were excluded from the pass-fail•/-'. The following is the text of Dean Hovde 's announcement: The College Committee on Instruction is putting forth for consideration by faculty and students a proposal which, if approved for trial, would put the freshman year substantially on a pass-fail basis. We have spent many hours talking about the various suggestions which have been made about the grading system, and while doing so we have on principle denied individual requests for exceptions to ten present letter-grade system. To have done otherwise would have been to change by special precedent a system established by the faculty long ago, and in a matter where there are strong arguments for common practice and control. In making this proposal we have tried to balance twothings--on the one hand, the possible virtues of the pass-fail system and, on the other, our firm conviction that students must be carefully evaluated by their teachers-no change in grading can be permitted to diminish this. The proposal focuses on the freshman year for, several reasons. Students entering selective colleges have for many years been under pressure to collect as many good grades as possible, and it may prove to be true that a first year without publicly recorded final grades will make students more comfortable without reducing the will to work. It is to be noted that our plan assures just as much information as we now have about performance for Columbia's own purposes-the only change is that the final grades would not be recorded on the transcript. That we suggest this for freshman courses does not indicate any feeling that these courses are ""less important"" than more advanced work; but we feel, among other things, that pass-fail entries for the first year will not prejudice our students in their applications to graduate schools, which are primarily concerned with upper-college performance, particularly in the major. It was for a similar reason that we omitted the introductory science courses which are important public evidence for students who. are applying to some graduate programs, medical school being an example. We propose this plan for trial in the coming academic year.II 111 Ml ■■ I 111 I I 1 EEM^^^m^— A Note to Some Skeptical Readers Who Thought Friday's Spectator Was an April Fool's Issue Once a year reporters on Spectator prove to themselves that the events in the so-called real world which they cover are not so different from complete fiction.

207,Bell Will Leave for Post at Harvard,23 April 1969,"Daniel Bell, long identified as one of the bulwarks of the College faculty, has resigned from Columbia and will assume a position at Harvard University after next year. The fifty year-old professor of sociology, author of a book-length critique of general education at Columbia, said yesterday that personal reasons had motivated his decision to move to Cambridge. Several weeks ago the New York Times reported that Professor Bell would leave for Harvard, but at that time he maintained his decision was not final. Professor Bell is one of three teachers leaving the College sociology department,which is already hard-pressed for faculty. Two popular non-tenure faculty members—lecturer William Martin and instructor A.E. Bryan Heading—will also not return next year. The department has announced the appointment of two new assistant professors, but it has not yet found a tenure replacement for Professor Bell, who now teaches two seminars. Professor Bell said yesterday that he would spend a year at the Russell Sage Foundation before moving to Cambridge. During the year, he said, he will edit a book on social change and continue work on a history of European socialism and a monograph on Albert Brisbane and Charles Fourier.A journalist for many years before fully entering the academic world, Bell served as managing editor of the New Leader and labor editor of Fortune before coming to Columbia in 1959. He is now editor and co-founder with Irving Kristol of The Public Interest, a quarterly which deals with questions of social policy. A graduate of City College, Professor Bell taught at the University of Chicago in the late forties and lectured part-time at Columbia's School of General Studies in the early fifties. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1960. A collection of essays written during his years as a journalist appeared in 1960 under the title, ""The End of Ideology,"" which has since then become a rubric for several theories about modern society. Bell now says that he does not regret the title phrase, in spite of what has happened since then, for example, at Columbia. But a friend of Professor Bell, Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer, commented, ""What he meant was that ideology should end. It just turns out it didn't."" Professor Bell is also the author of a history of Marxism in the United States and editor of abook on the ""radical right."" In 1966 he published ""The Reforming of General Education."" In recent years he has written extensively on questions of social forecasting and the impact of technology, and will publish a book later this year on ""post-industrial society""—a term he coined. He has served as chairman of a government panel on social indicators and of another commission on the year 2000. Asked why he had resolved to leave Columbia, Professor Bell — in somewhat typicalfashion—first commented on the difficulties of analyzing decision-making and then observed that he had ""adesire to get away from New York City"" and to work more closely with various colleagues at Cambridge—Patrick Moynihan, James Q. Wilson, Samuel Huntington, Alex Inkeles. Professor Bell's report on the reforming of general education recommended that the College employ a more historical approach in Contemporary Civilizations and Humanities A; formulate a uniformmath-science requirement; and adopt a ""third tier"" of interdisciplinary general education courses which might ""brake"" the tendency toward specialization. The report came under attack from such University figures as 1.1. Rabi and Jacques Barzun, and has not been used as the basis for a reorganization of the curriculum. But it has received national attention and was issued recently in book form. The two new assistant professors in the sociology department next year will be Marcel Teitler, a specialist in North African society who received a doctorate from Berkeley, and Caroline Atkinson, a black graduate of Har-vard. A distinguished Marxist sociologist from theSorbonne, Lucien Goldman, will be a visiting professor next year, teaching a course on Marxism open to College students. The recent decision of an interdepartmental tenure committee to postpone action indefinitely on Herbert Gans, a visiting professor, has left the sociology department without a candidate for one of the urban chairs endowed by the Ford Foundation. Professor Gans last week accepted an appointment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The sociology department will also partly lose the services of Professor William Goode, who hasreceived a five-year research grant and will probably be unable to teach full-time. Last week the department elected Professor Amitai Etzioni as its new chairman, replacing Paul Lazarsfeld, Quetelet Professor of Sociology, who will retire this spring. Since last year the graduate division 1 has been seriously divided, with a fairly large number of the students supporting the strike of last spring.Daniel Bell"
208,"Committee Accepts Anderson Proposal Would Replace CC, Humanities, English With Common Course For All Freshmen",24 April 1969,"Would Replace CC, Humanities, English With Common Course For All FreshmenBy JON GRONEROne hundred fifty freshmen next year may take a single ten-point course on a specialized topic in place of Humanities A, Contemporary Civilization A, and English composition. The College Committee on Instruction yesterday approved a plan proposed by Professor of English Quentin Anderson which would set up such a course next fall on an experimental basis. The proposal must now be approved by the College faculty. If the plan is approved, ten sections of the new freshman course would be set up next semester. Each section would be limited tp about, fifteen students andwould be taught by both a full- < time faculty member and a preceptor. A specific topic in the humanities or social sciences would be selected for each section. It is expected that the proposal will first be discussed at a faculty smoker for the entire College teaching staff on April 30. Professor Anderson said yesterday that he hopes his proposal, which was originally circulated among College faculty members just before Christmas vacation, will soon be approved so that it can go into effect next term. ""I'm going to scrap for it, and I know other faculty members who will scrap for it,"" Professor Anderson said. The plan was originally put forth in order to give direction and unity to the freshman year and to eliminate the ""obsolescence"" of the cur-rent general education offerings. Dean Carl F. Hovde said yesterday that he considers the Anderson proposal ""very interesting* and that he ""would like to see it tried."" ""I hope that there's enough faculty interest in the plan toapprove itas an experiment,"" he stated. Joseph Rothschild, professor of government and director of the CCA program, said yesterday that he foresaw opposition to the Anderson proposal by the CCA staff. He said that the discussion of the plan at the April 30 smoker would be ""decisive"" in determining the plan's success. Since the majority of the instructors of CCA and Humanities A are below the rank of assistant professor, Professor Rothschild explained, they would not be qualified to attend the College faculty meeting but would be present at the smoker for the entire College teaching staff.He stated that many CC instructors would be ""doubtful"" regarding, the Anderson proposal since ""they feel as if they've already had their revolution."" Professor Rothschild was referring to the complete revamping of the CCA syllabus which took effect this fall. The director of the Humanities A program, Professor of French Donald Frame, expressed reservations about Professor Anderson's proposal. ""There's a lot in it which I like, but I would be very sorry to see Humanities A go,"" he said yesterday. Professor Frame added, however, that he will probably vote for the proposal."
209,Panel Criticizes Anderson Plan,28 April 1969,"By MARTIN FLUMENBAUMThe Undergraduate Academic .Affairs Committee yesterday released a plan for reorganization of the freshman year curriculum as an alternative to a proposal made by Professor of English Quentin Anderson for a ten-point common course to supplant Humanities A, Contemporary Civilization A, and English Composition. The committee suggested that both semesters of English composition be discarded and replaced with a one-term course modeled after English 1003 -- a course involving the close scrutiny of a single text. It also recommended that the College provide freshmen with the option of taking one of the three basic general education courses as a seminar. The College Committee on Instruction approved the Anderson plan last week and suggested that ten sections, each limited to fifteen students and taught by a full-time faculty member and apreceptor, be established next fall on an experimental basis. The proposal now must be approved by the College faculty. ""My scheme extrapolates the notion of the freshman seminar,"" Professor Anderson wrote in Febru-ary, ""seeks to preserve not the common experience of Humanities A or Contemporary Civilization, but a common emphasis on responsible inquiry, methodological rigor, and inclusive treatment leading to at least a modest mastery on the part of the student."" Alan Sparer '69, author of the Academic Affairs Committee proposal, stated that the Anderson plan lacked ""breadth"" and would be ""demoralizing."" In a two-page critique, Sparer declared that ""Professor Anderson's program, in restricting itself to smaller 'topics' for intensive study, overemphasizes depth to the exclusion of breadth.It is not general education, but early specialization."" Maintaining that the committee's proposal ""attempts to combine breadth and depth,"" Sparer noted several difficulties involved in the common course proposal. First he warned that those freshmen who are taught by poor instructors or who lose interest in the selected topic would be in a worse position under the Anderson plan than they are now. ""It is likely that many of them will drop out of school,"" he declared. Second, Sparer noted that having; the same fifteen students in sixty per cent of their classes ""will restrict the social life of freshmen, just when it is most important that they be exposed to a wide varietyof fellow students."" Similarly, having the same faculty member for sixty per cent of their class time ""will limit their ac-quaintance with the faculty, just when they need to see a large variety of teachers, in order to have some rational basis for the selection of a major field."" Third, Sparer maintained that if the Anderson proposal were approved, all flexibility in the freshman year schedule would be lost. ""Almost all freshmen will be forced to take the same program: the Anderson ten-point course, a foreign language, and a math or science course."" Professor Anderson has suggested that 150 instructors would be required to teach the common course-35 teachers per term more than the present CC, Humanities and freshman English staffs. Sparer, however, said the number 'would be considerably higher since professors teaching the common course would be entitled to a reduction in the rest of their course load.Alan SparerQuentin Anderson"
210,The Anderson Plan,28 April 1969,"Last week, with little fanfare or publicity, the College Committee on Instruction passed a proposal which would introduce on an experimental basis a single, ten-point freshman course to replace Humanities A, Contemporary Civilization A, and English composition. The plan, which would apply to 150 students next year, was conceived by Quentin Anderson and has the backing of notables like Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling. Unfortunately, it seems to be heading for rapid endorsement by the College faculty. Professor Anderson argues that the current freshman courses are not working, and that what students need is intensive textual analysis which would train them in ""disciplined inquiry."" He says, ""We should be getting down to the brass tacks of logic, clear writing, responsible reading, demonstrated comprehension, at the outset""-- that is, in the freshman year. Tb accomplish these aims, Anderson suggests a year-long seminar, to meet six hours a week, taught by an assistant professor and a preceptor, devoted to one specialized subject. Anderson's own sample topics: ""The City in the 19th"" Century and After; Evolutionary Thought in Victorian England; Art Nouveau and Its Interpreters; John Dewey and American Schools; The History of Biology."" In other words, a student would spend his first year at Columbia taking, for example, Introductory Chemistry, second-year French, and Art Nouveau and Its Interpreters (or Disciplined Inquiry A). What Professor Anderson apparently forgets is that concentration on a single subject to the degree he proposes will succeed only if students have freely chosen the subject and really want to spend virtually the entire term examining it. Imagine the situation of the student who, three weeks into the semester, has irrevocably concluded that he is uninterested in Art Nouveau and its Critics, and finds his one tenpoint seminar dull. His whole freshman year is shot."" The Anderson plan masquerades as a return u» general education, but it is really the triumph' of methodology over history. For years people have bemoaned the tendency of survey courses to overemphasize historical generalizations at the expense of intensive analysis, and it was likely that out of this criticism a plan would arise for the total submersion of the historical framework in favor of an analytical one. But the shift to this extreme position should be resisted. Moreover, supporters of the Anderson proposal fail to consider what will actually happen in most cases if his plan becomes the accepted format. A topic chosen for the ten-point course will be the specialty of the assistant professor, who will probably discuss the minutiae of his field, not the logic of inquiry. Professor Anderson would have students do in their freshman year what academics do all their lives. There are other things wrong with the Anderson plan. It would restrict classroom contact to twelve or fifteen fellow students, and give freshmen exposure to fewer faculty members. There would be less opportunity for comparing different fields. Many students entering the sciences might never have the occasion to read the Homeric epics, Greek tragedy, the Republic, Augustine's Confessions, Dante, Milton, Rabelais and those who might read them later in literature courses,might never have the opportunity to look at those works as naive men.' That perhaps might be the greatest loss: In their freshmen year, students would be expected 10 examine literature as sophisticated scholars, as academic professionals— and it would all be pretense. The Academic Affairs Committee has presented an intelligent alternative to the Anderson proposal which merits consideration by the faculty. By eliminating English composition and substituting English 1003, the committee retains intensive study of a single text which Anderson wants- but within reasonable proportion to the rest of the curriculum. By establishing a seminar option in one of the general education courses, they provide for small discussion groups. But they do not eliminate Humanities A —one of the most eminently successful courses in the College— and they do not cut out Contemporary Civilization — which for all its faults, is still basically worth preserving. The staff CC has recently sought to eliminate the worse features of survey-type courses by revising the curriculum to permit concentration in particular historical periods. The changes they are making should not be cut short. If the College faculty endorses the Anderson plan, it may make no other modifications in the freshman curriculum, thinking that one experiment is enough for this year. In that case, we would not only suffer a bad change, but the bad change would also serve to drive out sensible reforms, such as the alternative plan proposed by Academic Affairs. paulstaxp:"
211,Dean Recommends New Panel Study General Education College Faculty Meeting Scheduled for Today,25 November 1969,"College Faculty Meeting Scheduled for TodayBy JON GRONERAt a College faculty meeting this afternoon, Dean Hovde will recommend the formation of a special faculty committee to study the general education program of the College. The Dean said yesterday that the committee would consider ""the character and direction of Contemporary Civilization, Humanities, and English A"" and would take up several proposals for curriculum reform initially made last year. Among the plans to be discussed by the committee is a proposal by Professor of English Quentin Anderson, which would subsitute for CCA, Humanities A, andfreshman English one required tenpoint freshman course concentrating on a single specialized topic. Also on the committee's agenda will be an alternative plan suggested by the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee. This would replace freshman English with a course concentrating on a single text or author. The Dean said he was uncertain whether the panel would consider the ""institutes"" plan put forward by Professor of Government Alan F. Westin, but he added that he was ""terribly eager"" that the proposal receive attention from the faculty. The new committee will include junior faculty members who teachthe three freshman courses, as well as senior professors, the Dean stated. No members have been appointed yet. The faculty will vote at the meeting on two alterations of the sec-ond-year Contemporary Civilization program recommended earlier this month by the Committee on Instruction. The committee proposed that students be allowed to fulfill both degree and major requirements with the same CCB course. It also recommended an increase in the number of courses which can be used to fulfill the requirement. In addition, the faculty may consider including instructors below the rank of assistant professor as voting members. However, the Dean said he is not sure that this question will be raised.Carl F. Hovde"
212,New Panel Reconsidering General Education,8 January 1970,"By JON GRONERThe new College Committee on Educational Policy, the latest in a series of committees to reconsider the College curriculum will determine how much of the academic tradition of the College is still valid. The committee, established by Dean Hovde last month, will con-sider every proposal for academic reform that has been publicized in the past year and a half—News Featureas well as some which have not. For the next few weeks it will deal with general topics—the needs, resources, and goals of the College—before getting down to specifics. General education will be one of the committee's major con-cerns. Student and faculty members have recently leveled broad criticisms against the traditional Humanities and Contemporary Civilization programs. A number of faculty members have advocated abolishing the two common courses and substituting a distributional requirement similar to that of most American universities. Discontent with the present program stems from a variety of sources. Some chairmen of departments which staff the general education courses regard them as extra burdens that draw instructors away from the departmental curriculum. If they were not required to supply instructors for CC and Humanities A, the departments could use those men to expand their own offerings. Those junior faculty members who would prefer to teach in their ownspecialized fields might also welcome the abolition or downgrading of general education courses. On the other hand, a number of faculty members such as Professor of Biology Cyrus Levinthal see any system of required courses as an interference with students' freedom of choice. Accordingly, the retention of CC and Humanities, possibly in a modified form on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis, is one of the more feasible options which the committee will consider. This suggestion would probably be quite popular among most students, who tend to support the idea of general education but oppose specific requirements. Most students feel that the ideal of general education is still valid but that the courses often fall far short of the ideal. Many students feel that a large number of the junior faculty members on the CC and Humanities staffs are not really qualified to teach such wide-ranging and demanding courses. They also complain that the courses are too broad in scope, and that the required reading is too heavy. Professor of Russian Robert Belknap, chairman of the new committee, predicted earlier this week that CC and Humanities will survive the reevaluation, but that therewill probably be a number of needed reforms. The committee may attempt to restore something of the original conception of the courses by encouraging more senior professors to teach them. Previous efforts to reform the College's academic program have only achieved mixed results. The •Joint College Commission (JCC), the last such effort, presenteda number of proposals in the fall of 1968 which have been generally ignored. Members of the new committee are determined that its recommendations not suffer the same fate. One member has said that he feels the JCC was ""the right thing at the wrong time"" and that the issuance of its report in the midst of the restructuring controversies of the fall of 1968 caused its recommendations to be overlooked amid a swarm of proposals. One committee member estimated that the group stands ""something less than a 50-50 chance* to produce proposals that could be approved by the faculty in time to be included in next year's catalogue.Robert Belkna"

214,Panel May Urge End to English A,24 February 1970,"By JON GRONERThe College Committee on Educational Policy appears likely to recommend later this spring that English A be abolished as a separate course, that experimental freshman seminars be set up to replace first-year Contemporary Civilization for some students, and that the math-science requirement be .revamned to stress biology and physics. The committee, which has been engaged"" for two months in an intensive evaluation of the curriculum, has not yet made any formal decisions, but interviews with members of the group indicate that a consensus has been reached on several specific points. The group has met at least once a week since mid-December and is discussing various aspects of the curriculum—CCA, Humanities A, the math-science requirement, the upper College major system—one by one, in consultation with members of the various departments. Professor of Russian Robert Belknap, chairman of the sixteen-man group, said yesterday that there is ""no chance* that the committee will recommend increasing academic requirements. He predicted that the group will attempt to ""relax"" requirements so that a student can fulfill them in a number of ways. For example, Professor Belknap i tated that many members of the committee favor setting up several experimental sections of a course that would serve as an alternative to CCA for a number of freshmen. The new course would be taught in a seminar format, with about fifteen students per section. Many members of the committee feel that English-A is unpopular with students and that is does not successfully teach writing skills. They suggest that composition be taught in conjunction with freshman CC or humanities. There is wide agreement on the committee that CCA is unsatisfactory in its present form. However, members disagree on the source of its inadequacies. Some, like Associate Professor of History David Rothman, consider the present syllabus ""intellectuallysloppy"" and claim that students get ""an incredibly confused sense of chronology"" from the course. Other members point to staffing difficulties and student discontent as problems with CCA. The math-science requirement has been the subject ofintense debate within the committee. Sidney Morgenbesser, professor of philosophy, advocated making the requirement considerably more rigorous by specifying such fields of science as physics or biology as necessary to fulfill the requirement. Eventually a compromise was reached; the committee probably will recommend that all the ""poets"" science courses be made more ""intellectually rigorous"" and include at least some physics and biology.According to many committee members, some existing ""poets"" courses, such as elementary geology or astronomy, are so far removed from current research in physics and biology as to provide a misleading idea of science to the non-science major. Geology Clolo,a new course on ""Man's Physical Environment,"" was cited as a science course which stresses physics and biology. The group may also recommend reducing the math-science requirement to one year, but a member indicated yesterday that there is still disagreement on this point within the group. The committee has not yet set a target date for releasing its formal proposals, but members have recently expressed hope that areport will be ready by the end of the end of the academic year in May so that experiments can be set up this September. It is not likely that the committee will recommend any extremely radical proposals, such as the abolition of all academic requirements or the replacement of the entire general education program with a system of distributional requirements. However, Profes-, sor Rothman praised the ""willingness of the committee to tamperwith CC"" and emphasized that major changes may be proposed within the existing academic framework. The committee has not yet formally discussed the second-year CC program, which consists of sixteen courses taught in seven departments. However, Professor Belknap indicated yesterday that the committed may recommend establishing some common approach among the CCB courses. After dealing with the CCB and Humanities B programs, the committee will discuss the upper College. Assistant Professor of Economics Raymond Lubitz said last week that the social science departments, which have undergone much criticism recently, will be considered in the greatest depth. Professor Belknap said yesterday that the committee may recommend that the departments assign more tenured professors to College teaching, but explained that ""it's a question of university priorities, and there's not much the committee can do about this.""Robert Belknap"
215,Freshman Year Revision Proposed,8 April 1970,"By JON GRONERThe College Committee on Educational Policy agreed last night to recommend a radical revision in the course offerings and requirements for the freshman year. The group's tentative proposal, which will be circulated among students and faculty members later this month, will provide that freshmen be allowed to fulfill their first-year requirements in one of three ways: —By taking Contemporary Civilization A, Humanities A, and a ""writing seminar"" which would replace freshman English; —By substituting an 8 to 10-point course, similar to that proposed last year by Professor of English Quentin Anderson, for Contemporary Civilization, Humanities, and English; —By substituting for regular Humanities A and English A a six-point course which would cover most of the material of the humanities sequence but place a greater emphasis on writing. Professor of Russian Robert Belknap, chairman of the committee, yesterday termed the proposal ""not a decision but a starting point."" He indicated that it is open to discussion and revision from interested students and faculty members. Professor Belknap said the plan would provide ""a great deal more individual attention. Every student would have one course where he'd come very close to one text."" He explained that the ""writing seminar"" which students could take in place of freshman English would be modeled on English ClOO3, a popular freshman course, and would focus on one major work. English A as it now exists would be abolished. The Anderson proposal, which was first drawn up about a year ago, was designed to allow freshmen toconcentrate on a single topic in place of taking the 1 current general education program. It was criticized| last year by the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee, which called the pla,n too restrictive. Professor Belknap said yesterday that he felt his committee's tentative recommendations were ""fairly conservative in coverage but quite radical in pedagogical approach."" In the proposal it will circulate later this month, the committee will also include recommendations dealing with the sophomore year curriculum and the staff-; ing of College courses. At the weekly meeting last night, members of the group were unable to reach complete agreement on these topics and postponed final consideration of them until next week.Robert Belknap"
216,"B. A. Requirements May Be Lowered Educational Panel Calls For Changes In CCB, Humanities, Sciences",28 April 1970,"Educational Panel Calls For Changes In CCB, Humanities, SciencesBy JON GRONERThe College Committee on Educational Policy is expected to recommend to the College faculty that the math-science requirement be reduced to one year of natural science, that Contemporary Civilization B be replaced by a distributional requirement, and that students be allowed to substitute a literature course for art and music humanities. The committee will vote tonight on the plan, which was proposed by Assistant Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman. Robert Belknap, professor of Russian and chairman of the panel, predicted last night that the group's recommendations have ""a very good chance"" of being approved by the faculty at its meeting next month.Assistant Professor of Greek and Latin Seth Schein, another member of the sixteen-man group, last night indicated that the Holtzman plan ""represents more or less what the committee will finally recommend."" He said, however , that the group may make minor changes in the proposal at tonight's meeting. According to Professor Schein, the main question that is yet to be decided is the status of mathema-' tics and foreign languages. The Holtzman proposal recommends that students be required to take a* year of either math or language, but some members of the committee oppose this provision, feeling that students should be required to fulfill a year of both subjects. The current science requirement can be satisfied with either two years of mathematics or a natural science. Under the committee's recommendations, only a year of natural science would qualify. If the proposal is adopted, math could be used in place of language. The panel will also recommend that any full-year course in the social sciences, including history, should satisfy the second-year CCB distributional requirement.Most members of the group feel that the current CCB courses are not fulfilling the function of general education courses. The committee consulted with the art and music departments before considering making art and music humanities optional. According to Professor Scheih, the panel was satisfied that ""fewer but better students"" would register for the courses if they were not required. Dr. Belknap said last night that one reason thatthegroup's recommendations are likely to be approved by the faculty is that the group has ""a lot of political power."" ""There's almost nobody who can say there's no one on this committee he can't really trust,"" Professor Belknap said. The Holtzmanplanis understood to represent a compromise between committee members such as Dr. Belknap, who wanted to retain the current number of required courses and those who wished to do away with all requirements. The group decided several weeks ago to recommend that freshmen have the option of taking a ten-point course to fulfill their general education requirement or a six-point course which would replace English A and either CCA or Humanities A.Eric Holtzman"
217,College Faculty to Convene To Debate Academic Reform,13 May 1970,"The College faculty will meet this afternoon ostensibly to discuss the recommendations of the Committee on Educational Policy. Today's meeting, the second in two days, will start at 2 p.m., and is a regularly scheduled session called several weeks before the strike began, to deal with issues of curriculum' reform. It is possible, however, that discussions related to the current political crisis may take up all or part of the meeting. The Committee on Educational Policy, which is chaired by Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap, has issued a two-page preliminary report embodying its proposal for curriculum reform. These proposals will be discussed, after the formal business of the meeting has been concluded, by the faculty as a ""committee of the whole."" - Professor Belknap explained last night that this device was used ""to avoid getting tangled in parliamentary procedure."" He ex-' pressed the hope that a free discussion of the proposals would occur. The proposals are scheduled to be voted on at anothermeeting May 20. The latest version of the edu-* cational panel's proposals asks that students be required to take three courses outside of their major field rather than four, as was originally proposed. It also suggests the creation of a perma-nent committee on general education to oversee the various options which the panel provided for the fulfillment of general education requirements. ""A majority of the Educational Policy Committee is persuaded that the importance of general education is greater rather than less in our present cultural situation,"" the preamble to the panel's draft proposal states. ""At this moment the main justification for having an undergraduate institution at Columbia seems to us to rest on the distinctive character of that institution,"" it closes. The committee agreed at its regular meeting last night *n a proposal to revamp College staffind. This proposal would set up five interdepartmental staffs to coordinate general education and interdepartmental majors. This proposal will also be presented to the faculty today. The faculty will also consider a proposal made by the Committee on Instruction to grade Humanities A, Contemporary Civilization A, and English A on a pass/fail basis. This proposal was originally submitted by the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee. In addition, the faculty will elect five new members to the Committee on Instruction for threeyear terms beginning in September."
218,Evaluating the Course Guide,13 May 1970,"By JON GRONEREvery year several freshmen mistake the Ted Kremer Society Course Guide in their orientation packet for the official College catalogue. This has given rise to suggestions that the College actually include teacher evaluations in the catalogue so that students can see exactly what they're ""getting into. But barring this rather radical innovation, the Course Guide remains an indispensable, though not infallible, supplement to the official course listings. This year's edition has come out and is hopefully on sale this week, if students can find time out from strike activities to sell it. A review of thff Course Guide is necessarily ill-defined; since the book is itself a review, to write about it is to take at least two steps away from reality. But the ""bible"" of College and Barnard students should not go unnoticed. The book is certainly worth buying. A dollar and a half is surely not too expensive for such valuable information as how best to survive the math-science requirement, where to find ""a Buddha"" teaching Freshman English, and what kind of teacher Dean Hovde •makes, (look it up and see.) The brief evaluations are, with few exceptions well-written and informative, and some of the student quotes are quite humorous. The two-page discussions of the larger departments and of Humanities A, CCA, and freshman English are full of hard information, the sort which ""everybody knows"" but rarely gets into print. There have been several changes in the book since last year; the most obvious, and certainly the most purposefully devised, is the substitution of numerical ratings from Ito 5 fo the letter grades in last year's Course Guide. The editors assert that numbers are •more objective than grades, which is surely true; but there probably was also a desire to avoid bejng thought petty and vengeful in giving instructors grades of ""D"" and ""F"". Incidentally, many of the professors who got failing grades last year either left Columbia or did not teach the same courses this year. In keeping with the trend towards co-education, Barnard courses are now included in the main body of the book rather thanshuntedaside to a segregated section in the back of the book. Sometimes it is possible to compare a Columbia course with a similar Barnard course, and the results are not always what a complacent College student might expect. This year, the editors of the Course Guide attempted to insure a higher response rate by distributing questionnaires in class rather than in the campus mail. This new procedure probably did increase the number of responses, but apparently has its own difficulty:only those students who went to class replied, and those sobored or disgusted with a course that they didn't show up got no say at all. In some cases, this may have harmed the credibility of the evaluations by giving a professor a higher grade than he deserved. Some students feel that the respondents were too lenient with their professors: an average course rating of 3.9 and instructor rating of 3.7 out of 5 seems too high to them. But these figures imply only that we should readjust the scales. If 3.9 is an average rating, an instructor who got 3.5 is below par, especially if the departmental average was high. The slight rise in average rating which occurred this year does not necessarily mean thatthe quality of Columbia education has improved: it may only mean that the students who filled out the forms interpreted the numbers differently. The book is not only useful for students planning their programs; it is also valuable in charting the progress of the various departments. A good example is the math department, whose improvement and innovations this year might have gone unnoticed this year had it not been for the Course Guide. There is nodoubt that the Guideis read with both relief and revulsion by instructors and with great interest by departmental chairmen and administrators. Itisthe> most direct way in which students can influence the kind of education the College provides, and it seems to have several instructors to improve their courses. For this, and for their hard work and concise style, the editors and staff should be commended. But a few minor gripes in this evaluation: the photography such as there is of it, is mostly extremely poor, although this is reportedly the printer's fault. The photos do not help the book and should either be discontinued or* considerably expanded in number and enhanced in quality. Some courses, especially in the foreign languages, either are not covered or are poorly covered; however, this may be due to poor student response. There are some glaring typos: surely it is Herbert Deane, not Keane. And, strangely, some sentences in the introductory methodological note are repeated almost verbatim from last year's book. This appears just plain lazy. A last note of carping criticism: the book is apparently bound with spit and a prayer, as my copy split in half at the seams within a few hours."
219,Academic Reform: Another Try,16 September 1970,"By JON GRONERAcademic' reform in the College, which was temporarily overshadowed last spring by the massive student strike, will return to prominence late this month when the faculty votes on a far-reaching plan to revamp the system of general education requirements. The plan, which was recommended to the faculty last May by the sixteen-man Committee on Educational Policy, calls for major reforms in requirements for both the freshman and sophomore years. Freshmen, rather than having to take the traditional freshman courses—Humanities, English A and Contemporary Civilization—would be able to choose an eight to ten point seminar in place of 'all three; a six-point course to replace English A and either CCA or Humanities A; or the normal CC and Humanities courses, plus a writing seminar to replace the current English A. The committee, chaired by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap, also recommended that the CCB requirement be abolished, that only one year of natural science be required, that either art or music humanities—but not both—be mandatory, and that all students be required to take at least four elective courses in fields remote from their major. The committee, composed of seven senior faculty members, six junior faculty members, and three students, de-; liberated for nearly five months before producing its final recommendations., These recommendations were to be voted, on at a faculty meeting last May, but' the campus crisis, as well as the desire of some professors to have more time to consider the plan, forced the vote to be postponed until October. Thus this committee, the latest jn along series of groups charged with eval-> uating the College curriculum, will finally see an up-or-down vote on its recommendations. The committee was guided by both philosophical and practical considerations in making its recommendations. The flexible system of requirements, members explained last year, takes into account the student desire for a reduction in requirements, as well as the insistence of some senior professors on some structure in the curriculum. The recommendations for the freshman year were influenced by a plan proposed In 1960 by Professor of English Quentn AndeTson. This plan, which is included as one of the freshman options in the Belknap recommendation, calls for a ten point course to fulfill ,all freshman requirements. The success of English 1003—a writing seminar for selected freshmen based on literary texts—helped prompt the pan? 1 to recommend >nch a course for all. freshmen. Professor Belknap last year summarized the committee's rjcormmvi Wons as ""fairly conservative in coverage but quite radical in pedagogical approach."" Last spring, instead of taking up the Belknap proposal in detail as expected, the faculty was forced to spend much time, and at least three hurriedly-assembled meetings, on interim grading arrangements in the wake of the student strike. The resolution finally approved permitted students to request any combination of !, P"" grades, incompletes, or letter grades fox* lasf term's v.vk All incomplete work is due October 9. A major innovation in the educational format was approved last March by the College Committee on Instruction andwill begin in the spring semester. A fifteen-point ""institute"" in American politics and social change will be taught by Professor of Political Science Alan F.. Weston, Assistant Professor Gordon Adams, and another instructor soon to be named. This course will constitute the entire academic schedule of all students and faculty members involved and will use field trips, lectures by outside consultants, films, and other unusual devices, as well as the ordinary lecture and discussion format. The focus of the ""institute* will be on independent research by students and criticism by other students rather than formal grading. The plan, like the Anderson proposal, represents the fruition of an idea originally formulated nearly two years ago. Professor Westin, along with Associate Professor of Sociology Immanuel Wallerstein and Professor of History Walter Metzger, was one of the original authors of the plan in December 1968. Two new courses in urban studies, as well as a new student-initiated program in urban studies, are other major changes in this year's College curriculum. The courses are an introduction to urban studies from the point of view of five social sciences, and a seminar in ""The City as a Way of Life.* A student may now major in urban studies in conjunction with a major in any social science^ Cross-listing with Barnard has been considerably increased this year, especially in such departments as French, art history, English, political science, and sociology. In addition, many departments have considerably revamped their College course offerings, including political-] science, English, art history, psychology,! and history. JRobert Belknap"
220,Letter to the Faculty,16 September 1970,"It has become apparent that if Columbia College is to continue offering students the quality education for which it has been noted, curriculum changes are necessary. If we do not move with the times while maintaining our standards, we soon shall be left behind. Having thought about the matter, and having read a number of curriculum reform plans of other institutions, I would like to submit the following proposals. The assumptions underlying the following proposals are: —that there is such a vital object as a liberal srts curriculum and it still has validity and relevance; --that an education is incomplete without systematic exposure to the disciplines which comprise the liberal arts, for they foster the necessary spirit of critical inquiry and appreciation, albeit in disparate ways; --that exposure to aspects of the liberal arts cannot and should notbe left wholly to chance; and, —that given the increasing diversity of the College student body, there is a need for at least a minimum collegial common experience such as is to be found in the original basic general education courses. The proposals are: I. Requirements for the degree should be the following: —Humanities A and Contemporary Civilization A. -Art Humanities and Music Humvanities. •—A seminar in the style of English ClOO3, —Two semester courses in natural science, one of which should be a laboratory course. —Two semester courses in the social sciences drawn from appropriate introductory courses in anthropology, economics, history, political science, or sociology. —Two semester courses informal and analytical thought drawn from introductory courses in Unguis-tics, mathematics, or philosophy. -rßeading competence in a foreign language, to be demonstrated through proficiency examinations taken no later than, the end of the sophomore year; these examinations to serve as an alternative to the introductory language courses. —Two semesters of physical education. 11. Students should continue to have majors, which must be declared before registering for a sixth term. The major program should be subject to the following: —students should be allowed to, work out individually designed in-' terdepartmental majors subject to the approval of the departmental consultants and the Committee on Instruction or an appropriate subcommittee to be appointed by it. —qualified seniors whose programs have been approved by their major department and the Committee on Instruction or an appropriate sub-committee to be appointed by it may be granted a maximum of one semester's credit for independent study.—one-third of a student's total point load during each semester should be taken outside his major. 111. Allowance should be made for a limited number of studentinitiated courses for juniors and seniors on the following bases: —at least 13 juniors and seniors, including the student proposer, must indicate their intention to* enroll for the course. Should the course fail to attain the requisite number of 13, it would be annulled, —each student-initiated course must have as a sponsor a member of the professorial faculty who will partake in all meetings and activities of the class. As this participation will count as part of his regular course load, the faculty, member must receive his department's approval to participate, —before 15 April of the academic year preceding the offering of the* course, the student-initiators of the course, with the participation 1 of the involved faculty member, will draw up a syllabus (including reading lists) to be presented for approval to the Committee on Instruction or a sub-committee appointed by it. Student-initiated courses will be subject to the regular grading procedure, —no student may take more than one such course a year; no faculty member may participate in more than one such course in an academic year. The undersigned is anxious to receive any comments, criticisms, or emendations. Daniel J. Leab Associate Dean for Academic Affairs September 1, 1970"
221,Leab Will Present Proposal For Revision of Curriculum,24 September 1970,"By JON GRONERAssociate Dean for Academic Affairs Daniel J. Leab has composed a new proposal for academic reform in the College and will present it to the faculty early next mpnth. The plan, which Dean Leab yesterday termed ""more structured"" than the recommendations of the Committee on Educational Policy, may be offered as a substitute for the latter proposal. The dean's plan would involve the following innovations: reducing the math-science requirement to two semesters, substituting a seminar for freshman English, requiring two semesters of a social science in place of CCB, requiring two semestersin ""formal and analytical thought,"" and providing greater opportunity for interdepartmental majors and student-ini-tiated courses. The plans, however, would retain the existing requirements in CCA, Humanities A, and art and music humanities. The Committee on Educational Policy, chaired by Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap, last spring recommended major liberalizations in these required courses. The recommendations of the Belknap committee have encountered criticism from several faculty members, and Dean Leab said that his proposal is partially designed to meet some of that criticism. The faculty is scheduled to meet at a still undetermined date in early October to resume its consideration of the Belk-nap committee's recommendations. In an interview yesterday Dean Leab said that his plan is based on the idea that ""there is such a thing as liberal arts and there is still a role for general education."" The dean explained that the proposed new requirement in ""formal and analytical thought,"" which would be satisfied by any introductory course in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy, is designed to ""teach students how to think."" Several faculty members contacted yesterday indicated that heated debate is likely at the meeting, and that the Belknap committee's recommendations will probably not be approve d without modification. Some provisions of the Belknap plan, however, such as abolishing CCB and reducing the science requirement to one year, are considered to have a very good chance of passage. Dean Leab said that he was hopeful that his plan will be substituted for the Belknap plan, and indicated that it is also possible that still other proposals will be debated by the faculty.A member of the Belknap committee yesterday stated that the panel had not met this year and that its future is in doubt since five of its members are either on leave or no longer at Columbia. Several faculty members also indicated that Dean Hovde might appoint another committee to examine the College curriculum.Daniel J. Leab"
222,Education Committee Reaffirms Proposals,13 October 1970,"By JON GRONERIn its last scheduled meeting before the faculty convenes October 22, the College Committee on Educational Policy last night reaffirmed the proposals for curriculum reform which the body offered to the faculty last spring. The panel, however, also decided not to present a nine-page preamble to the faculty along with its recommendations. After several members objected to parts of the preamble, the committee agreed that the statement would be presented only as the personal opinion of the chairman, Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap. Several members of the committee last night expressed uncertainty on the proposal's chance of passage next week. They stated that faculty members have not yet had a chance to consider the plan in depth. The report, which was originally drafted last spring, proposes a ten-point course replacing CCA, Humanities A, and English A and a six-point course replacing eitherEnglish A and either Humanities A or CCA, as options for freshmen. It also proposes that only one year in the sciences be required, that either art or music humanities, but not both, be required, and that a three-semester distributional requirement be initiated. The only member dissenting from the substantive proposals of the panel was Assistant Professor of Greek and Latin Seth Schein. Professor Schein, who will explain the reasons for hisdissenttodayin a letter to the faculty, could not be reached last night for comment. Before the report of the Belknap committee is presented to the fa-culty October 22, it will go before the Committee on Instruction Wednesday, where it may face stiff opposition. It is understood, however, that the plan will be submitted to the faculty even if it does not meet with the approval of that panel. The preamble which was not accepted by the panel last night is a broad discussion of problems involving general education, pre-ceptors and other non-tenured faculty, and the major system. Several members of the committee criticized it for allegedly belittling the abilities of College students and for an alleged lack of sufficient concern for the rights of junior faculty members. Members of the committee indicated last night that they felt the preamble required ""some minor editing"" but that it was too late to edit it according to their wishes. Therefore it was decided to dissociate the committee from the preamble. It is understood that many faculty members favor several of the Belknap committee's recommendations, especially the reduction of the science requirement and the elimination of CCB as it now exists. The plan to establish a ten-point seminar, however, has encountered criticism from some faculty members who are concerned that freshmen electing the course will be ""locked in* if they find the seminar they are taking uninteresting. Some faculty members alsofear that the standard Humanities and CC courses will lose much popularity if the new course is initiated. Some members of the Belknap panel last night expressed reservations about the effectiveness of their proposal, even if it passes the faculty. ""The chances that it will pass are fair,"" Assistant Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman stated, ""but the chances that it will accomplish anything are dubious."" Dr. Holtzman cited budgetary pressures necessitated by the university's financial squeeze as obstacles to real academic change in the College. In addition to the Belknap report, the faculty will consider an alternative plan written by Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Daniel J. Leab and a plan to make the major requirement optional, written by Professor of Psychology Eugene Galanter. The Belknap committee was appointed by Dean Hovde last December.Robert L. Belknap"
223,Schein Dissents From Report Of Curriculum Committee,14 October 1970,"Seth Schein, assistant professor of Greek and Latin yesterday dissented from the recommendations of the College Committee on Educational Policy and called for the extension of the pass-fail option to all courses and the extension of the degree program to six years rather than the current four. Professor Schein focused his criticism of the panel's report, which will be voted on bytheComm ittee on Instruction this afternoon and by the faculty next week, on its provisions for the freshman year. He said that the proposed optional ten-point freshman course ""would present great budgetary and staffing problems"" and ""would drastically narrow rather than expand a freshman's intellectual horizons."" He also said that to merge English A with Humanities A or CCA for some freshmen would be ""merely transferring its blight to two courses which are now relatively healthy—an undesirable transfer."" Professor Schein, the only regular member of the panel to dissent, did endorse several of the group's other proposals: reducing the math-science requirement to one year, requiring only onesemester in either art or music humanities, and instituting a three semester distributional requirement. ""The present burden of requirements is so alienating to so many students that these changes are highly desirable,"" he stated. The classics professor emphasized however, that he does not favor ""standing pat, which seems to me the dismal intent and effect of the plan Dean Leab has circulated."" Dean Leab's plan, which will also be discussed by the Committee on Instruction today, retains, according to Professor Schein, most of the features of the current College curriculum. ""Our committee has not dealt with certain matters which seem to me far more important than curricular tinkering, if we are to reduce somewhat the widespread disaffection among Columbia College students toward their academic work and thus improve our educational policy,"" Professor Schein concluded. In addition to Professor Schein, Dean Leab, who is ex-officio secretary of the academic panel, also dissented from the group's recommendation."
224,Instructors Score Belknap Proposal,16 October 1970,"By JON GRONERThe Contemporary Civilization and Humanities A staffs, in separate memoranda, have severely criticized the Committee on Educational Policy's plan for optional ten or six-point seminars for freshmen. Under the proposals, the seminars would replace all or part of the general education requirement for some freshmen. The Humanities statement flatly opposed the proposals, finding them ""educationally unsound and administratively unworkable,"" while the CC statement, a ""preliminary response,"" simply suggested that current innovations in the CC course be given time to ""prove themselves"" before the panel's recommendations go into effect. ""Things are often pronounced a' success or a failure before they're given a chance,"" Professor of Political Science Joseph Rothschild, chairman of the CCA staff, said in an interview yesterday. ""We are not challenging the faculty's legal right to change the. curriculum—the CC staff has no official standing—but it's a question of what would be wise,"" he explained. Among the changes begun this year in the CCA course are the increased use of seminar format and a more flexible reading list. The CCA staff also petitioned the College faculty for permission to send a four-man delegation to the October 22 faculty meeting, when the report of the educational panel, chaired by Professor Robert L. Belknap, will be debated. The Humanities staff, in a statement drafted by Professor of English John D. Rosenberg, chairmanof the program, and four other members of the staff, criticized the proposal to set up ten-point seminars on several grounds. ""The Committee's array of options appears to imply an ascending order of elitism, ranging from ""regular"" Humanities A and CCA to an intensive, 10-point seminar... This impression of elitism maywell result in turning the course which the students themselves praise as 'the best of the freshman requirements' into a sort of Remedial Humanities for the unprepared.* The same argument—thatthe value of regular Humanities and CC would bedenigrated—was also used by Assistant Professor of Greeek and Latin Seth Schein in his dissent from the report of the Belknap committee. The Humanities staff also scored the idea of a ten-point seminar, first proposed by Professor Quentin Anderson, because they saw it as too ""specialized* and because the idea of a course common to all freshmen would be lost. ""We cannot exaggerate the cohesive advantages to the College at this time of a core curriculum for freshmen. . .Whatever advantage (the pew options) offer must be weighed against the loss of community they would entail. . . A seminar in Moby Dick is not Humanities,*It is expected that representatives of both staffs will speak at the faculty meeting against the Belknap proposal. The Committee on Instruction met Wednesday to debate the plan, but after three hours of debate reached no conclusions.Joseph RothschildRobert BelknapJohn Nevin"
225,On Academics I,20 October 1970,"■«-s_ — _ „ . This Thursday the College faculty will resume its annual ritual of attempting to reform the College's antiquated system of requirements ?or the bachelor of arts degree. In the past few years, several blue-ribbon panels, most notably the joint College Commission, have recommended sweeping structural and curriculum changes, reforms which for the most part have been either defeated or covertly ignored. Before the faculty at this upcoming meeting are two proposals for amending course requirements, one submitted by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap, chairman of the Educational Policy Committee, the other proposed by Daniel Leab, associate dean for academic affairs. There is also Professor of Psychology Eugene Galanter's plan to make the entire requirement for a major or concentrate optional. No matter what the decision on the Belknap or Leab plans, Professor Galanter's proposal must be passed. It is by far the most progressive of the resolutions before the faculty, and possibly for that reason, seems certain of overwhelming defeat. The criticism of the Galanter proposal has been particularly vitriolic. ""The proposal would not give the student a focus for his program."" ""The plan could easily create incoherence in a student's work, especially in the last two years of study."" It appears, however, that this rhetoric is based on a misunderstanding of the Galanter plan. Majors would not be abolished, just made optional. Students would be able to take more inter-disciplinary programs, master one subject if they desire, or just engage in a bit of sampling. The incoherence of the current major system is known to many a sophomore who has been forced into a program or a discipline he later discovers ""was just not for him."" The Galanter plan seems the easiest way to restore flexibility and foster creativity within a generally archaic structure. Although Professor Belknap has worked tirelessly over the past eighteen months to come up with his proposals for a revamped structure of requirements, the plan, if approved, would be an administrative, if not an intellectual, catastrophe. My major opposition centers around his proposals for the freshman year. Incoming freshmen could opt for a ten-point seminar replacing Contemporary Civilization A, Humanities A, and freshman English; a six-point seminar replacing English A and either Humanities A or CCA; or just the three core courses given separately. Administratively, this apparatus would create chaos. Since the seminars are to be restrictive, which freshmen will be admitted to them? Furthermore, how could a freshman after only two weeks at Columbia make an intelligent decision among these mind-boggling choices? What happens if the freshman, after attending the ten-point seminar decides he dislikes his professor, or the subject to be intensely discussed? His first term at Columbia is a total failure. What the first-year program needs is not magical ten or six point formulas, but only some .careful reconsideration. Freshman English should be abolished and replaced by English ClOO3-type courses which have proven so successful on an experimental basis over the last two years. Humanities A, which is one of the finest offerings in the College, should be ""kept in its current format, perhaps allowing individual instructors more latitude in selecting a reading list. The main problem of the freshman requirements is, of course, Contemporary Civilization, which for thirty some years has been the pride of the Columbia faculty. Pride, however, cannot teach freshmen, and this course has failed specifically because tenured professors have refused to teach it. The course should be restructured so that each week different tenured professors can address huge numbers of freshmen on special areas of discussion. These large lectures could then be supplemented by recitation classes taught by the preceptors and junior faculty members who have been carrying the full teaching load of this course for several years. A system of lectures by specialists, followed by two small recitations each week, could be the only means of revitalizing CC. In its current form, the course should be abolished. What Dean Leab has proposed for the freshman year is very similar to the current status quo. Although he proposes the continuation of CCA, Humanities A, and the acceptance of English ClOO3, he makes absolutely no recommendations on how to reorganize the structure of CCA. Unless his freshman plan is amended, it must also be rejected. I will discuss academic reform for upperclassmen tomorrow. -MARTIN FLUMENBAUM"
226,Belknap Plan Headed for Defeat,21 October 1970,"By JON GRONERThe report of the College Committee on Educational Policy appears headed for defeat at tomorrow's College faculty meeting, though some of its recommendations have a fair chance of passage. The other major plan to be considered, Professor of Psychology Eugene Galanter's proposal to make majors and concentrates optional for College students, alsoNews Analysisfaces uncertain prospects at the faculty meeting. A great deal of opposition has recently developedto the policy committee's plan for the freshman year, which offers freshmen the option of ten-point or six-point courses in place of all or part of the general education program. This provision was criticized by Assistant Professor Seth Schein, the panel's only dissenting member; by the Humanities and CC staffs; and by members of the Committee on Instruction at its meeting last week.The Committee on Instruction is expected to issue a statement at the close of its weekly meeting today on the committee's report. This statement is likely to be critical of the plan. The faculty may at its discretion deal individually with the proposals of the committee, chaired by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap. It can therefore reject the freshman-year proposals but accept some of the other provisions, such as the reduction of the math-science requirement and the institution of a distributional requirement. Opposition to the freshman-year proposals has been based on concerns that freshmen can be ""locked"" into an undesired seminar; that they will not be capable of rationally choosing among the options; that the regular CC and Humanities courses will lose status; that the subject matter of the seminars will not be comparable to that of Humanities and CC; and that the plan will be administratively unworkable. Professor Galanter's plan tomake majors and concentrates optional for College students is formally on the floor of the faculty from last May, and thus is likely to be the faculty's first order of business. This plan has been openly opposed by Dean Hovde and many influential faculty members; however it may appeal to many professors who would like a liberalization of the curriculum. Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Daniel J. Leab also has composed a plan for academic reform. The dean said yesterday, however, that he does not plan to introduce it from the floor. It is thus possible that the faculty may never get around to considering it. The Belknap committee has deliberated long and hard since itsformation last December, and several members have expressed weariness and a desire to ""get it all over with* at the faculty meeting. In addition, Professor Belknap has staked some of his considerable prestige on his plan, which he has vehemently defended against objections in the Committee on Instruction. Some faculty members would construe defeat for the Belknap plan as a personal defeat for the committee chairman, who has devoted many hours to the preparation of the proposal. The College faculty has just over 300 members, who usually meet only once a semester. Faculty meetings are noted for their high rate of absenteeism, and thus attendance is another important factor which makes prediction uncertain. The Belknap plan will be introduced by Professor Belknap and Professors Sidney Morgenbesser and Richard Friedberg. Representatives of the Humanities and CC staffs will probably speak against it, and there will be other speakers on both sides. Professor Galanter will speak for his own proposal. An ironic note is that while last year, Dr. Belknap was the chairman of Humanities A, this year, under the chairmanship of Professor of English John Rosenberg, the Humanities A staff has severely scored the proposal. On curriculum matters, thefac-ulty cannot be neatly divided into ""liberal* and ""conservative"" blocs, and thus it cannot be accurately predicted how a particular man will vote. The difficulty of preyicting the vote is further complicated by the fact that despite widespread publicity, many faculty members will have only a vague idea of what they are voting on before they enter the meeting. It is possible that the faculty will not reach any conclusions but instead postpone a vote until some future meeting. If heated controversy develops between proponents and opponents of the Belknap plan, the matter may simply be tabled. On the other hand, many members of the faculty would like to reach a decision one way or the other and will thus press for a quick vote. Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman also has a proposal to ex-tend voting rights in the faculty to all instructors below the rank rank of assistant professor. This plan, a revival of one which the faculty once considered, will probably not be dealt with at this meeting. The Belknap and Galanter plans, which were on the agenda last May, will take priority over the Holtzman plan, which must be classified as new business. The Holtzman plan has encountered mixed reactions in the faculty, and many professors would no doubt share James Darnell's sentiment that it is irrelevant since ""nothing ever happens at faculty meetings, anyway."" Tomorrow's meeting may prove or disprove Professor Darnell's deeply-felt sentiments. If the faculty comes to a decision either way, it will surprise many observers who—would see— em*y —action at all on its part as a sign of progress."
227,Academic reform game,22 October 1970,"To the Editor: Though the ""Welcome Class of 1974"" signs have been up in the Book Store and many students have been seen scurrying to classes, the fact that classes for the 217 th academic year have started at Columbia is most clearly evident in the commencement of this year's version of ""Academic Reform."" The rules for this game are simple, and participation is open to the 2700 undergraduates of the College, as well as the faculty, admin--istrators, alumni, and anyone else who thinks he's got a trick move. First of all, make some proposal which seems to deal with academic reform, but makes absolutely no changes in the degree requirements (beginners are advised to employ such terms as ""humanities A"" and ""CC A"" in their stategems). Next present it to some panel profoundly concerned with the superficial aspects of educational changes (the Committee on Instruction is an excellent forum for such presentation). The most important step is to publicize the proposal, have students get enthusiastic about it,and bandy it around with colleagues. Finally, it should be thrown to some Senate Committee (the game University Senate is even more humorous) or tabled by the faculty or defeated by the College Committee on Instruction. Last year's winner was Quentin Anderson. In an effort to give more freedom to students in their freshman year, he devised a 10point course that would replace C. C, humanities, and English composition. In terms of the game this was an excellent play, because students would still be coerced into taking these courses butthey would appear in a more palatable form. And true to the game, his moves did not even address themselves, to the freedom of a College student to decide what he wants to do during his academic life here. Professor Anderson is eligible for consideration this year also, since his proposal is still in lim bo. This situation always presents a problem for the game. Since little definite action is taken on most proposals, there of--ten are several contestants who enter the same curriculum ""innovations* more than once. But the future looks grim for Professor Anderson. After a few years of studying the rules in his office, Dean Leab has decided to participate in this year's contest. And his proposals may very well firmly entrench him as one of this decade-'s greatest players. Not only does Dean Leab offer no changes to speak of , but his series of proposals is so confusing thatit will take several months before anyone will be able to decipher it—months during which he will be amassing an unlimited number of points. There are poor sports in every contest, and Academic Reform has its share. I. M. Pei, university master planner, realized that when you have to build buildings it's better not to play games. But we'll show him—we won't consider his construction plans for a few years, at which time we won't be able to afford more than a few bricks. And there are those students who have the mistaken impression that, there's much more academic freedom in college than they found in their high schools, (Considering the requirements a freshman* takes, this is doubtful). ""We gave them 24-hour parietals in their dorms, what more do they want? And if they don't like our required courses, let them take the poet's sequences, use trots, and waste their time and money just like those classes before them."" Maybe this is the year to abandon the game. Professor Galanter has made a great step in this direction by proposing the abolition of the major as a requirement for the degree in the College. This puts the initiative for deciding his school career back into the hands of the student. Donald Frame voiced opposition toGalanter's program since he believed ""that most students would continue to choose majors even if the requirement were abolished"" (Spectator, October 6). But that appears to be the whole point of the issue—to let the student decide how he'll run his undergraduate life at Columbia.Though Galanter's proposal will do much to aid juniors and seniors, freshmen and sophomores will still be hampered with the more than 50 points of credit they must take of specific requirements. From those few faculty members and administrators concerned with the students, let me ask a favor. Get rid of all those requirements that are strangling us. If humanities A is as good as we all feel,, then teach it to freshmen, don't shove it down their throats. You teach the courses; let us worry about taking them. Let the $2550 we pay yearly buy more than a degree—let it finance an education. Sol Grossman '72 October 20. 1970Sol Grossman is junior class president."
228,Faculty Approves Resolution For Interdepartmental Staffs,5 February 1971,"By FRED SCHNEIDERDespite the lack of a quorum, the College faculty yesterday approved the creation of interdepartmental staffs for Oriental Civilization and Freshman English sem-' inars. It also called on the College administration to seek budgetary control of all joint staffs, including the Contemporary Civilization A and Humanities A staffs. These recommendations were the final proposals of the Committee on Educational Policy to the faculty. The panel's report was originally submitted at a meeting last May. In addition, the faculty called on the Dean's office and the science departments to develop an interdepartmental staff for science courses that fulfill the one-year science requirement. The policy committee had recommended the creation of a science staff. However, the facultysuggested that this matter be handled by the Dean. Rules of the College faculty stipulate that 63 members, twenty per cent of its membership, are needed to constitute a quorum. The faculty, however, approved the resolution submitted by the committee by a vote of 32-6. Because no member objected to the vote despite the lack of a quorum, the vote was ruled legal. The faculty decided to submit another proposal of the Committee on Educational Policy to the interdepartmental staffs. This recommendation asks staff chairmen to select certain graduate students as interdepartmental preceptors. Interdepartmental preceptors would be graduate students who only teach in interdepartmental staffs. Since they would not be responsible to any department, they would be committed entirely to general education. Professors of Psychology John Nevin and Eugene Galanter agreed to table their motion calling for the abolition, of major and concentration requirements.Professor of Russian Robert A. Belknap, chairman of the Committee on Educational Policy, told the faculty that the proposals of his_ group had indicated its desire ""to further the move towards general education in the College."" The panel, now dissolved, had proposed six and ten point seminars for freshmen, the reduction of the math-science requirement to a one year science requirement, the substitution of distributional requirements for the second year of Contemporary Civilization, and the reduction of the second year of humanities to one semester of either art or music humanities. Professor Belknap added that the actions of the faculty in continuing to require Humanities A, CCA, and both music and art humanities, showed that body's commitment to the liberal arts tradition. He called on the faculty to fulfill this commitment by approving the resolution to create the Oriental Studies and freshman English seminar staffs. This proposal also allowed them to secure senior faculty members rather than any junior faculty or graduate students a department could spare. After the meeting, Professor Belknap explained that due to the passage of his committee's proposal, the Oriental Studies program, whcih currently draws instructors from the departments of East Asian languages and cultures, history, international affairs, Middle East languages and cultures, and religion, would be strengthened by its independence from the contributing departments and by the budgetary pressure the College administration would be able to exert. Dean Hovde commented on the meeting's lack of a quorum, noting that the Committee on Instruction had discussed the necessity of changing the faculty rules which govern the meetings and which specify the qualifications of a mem-ber of the College faculty. He also announced that the Dean's office would probably be able to exceed the ten per cent administrative cost cut-back called for in a directive from President McGill.Robert Belknap"
229,Barnard Professors Suggest Course in Literary Heritage,4 March 1971,"Some members of the Barnard faculty have recently proposed that the college institute an interdisciplinary course in literary and cultural heritage. Professor of French Maurice Z. Shroder, one of the main proponents of the interdisciplinary course, predicted that the class syllabus would include certain great books. ""There's a broad base of reading that anyone who considers himself educated should have read,"" he remarked. The French professor maintained that Barnard currently offers no single course dealing with such varied classics as the Odyssey, Dante's Inferno and '' Paradise Lost. ""If you don't read it before you come or outside you won't read it,"" he said. Professor Shroder said he bases his opinions on a survey he has taken of about 500 Barnard women. The survey asked students whether they had read certain books including the Odyssey, Darwin's Origin of Species and various religious texts. The French professor noted the course would not be required. He added that it could take either of two forms—a freshman course or a course for juniors and seniors ""who suddenly say to themselves, I'm ready to graduate and I haven't read X, Y or Z."" Professor Schroder asserted that there was no chance that the course could be instituted next year, but said he hoped a general proposal could be drawn up before June. The plan would then have to be approved by the Barnard Committee on Instruction. In its general outlines, the plan resembles the Humanities A course now a degree requirement in the College. Professor Schroder's proposed course, however, would not be a requirement but would be open to those who wish to take it.Maurice Shroder"
230,Rehire Singer,5 March 1971,"To the Editor: In the spring of my freshman year at Columbia College, I had the good fortune of knowing a student in Carl Singer's Humanities Aclass. This student suggested I visit one of Mr. Singer's classes on The Brothers Karamazov. Sitting in on that class, I was convinced that Mr. Singer had succeeded most uncannily in the difficult job of immersing himself in the novel. He had also managed to succeed in what is probably the most impossible task for any teacher-he was able to communicate not only his insight, but his great enjoyment of the work discussed. Franz Kafka wrote in his Diaries on July 19, 1910 that, ""When I think about, it, I must say that my education has done me great harm in some respects. This reproach applies to a multitude of people...a crowd of teachers (whom I must press tightly together in my memory, otherwise one would drop out here and there..."" Carl Singer's name will not drop lightly from his students' memories. If the University's admittedly necessary attrition is not to be to the detriment of fine teaching at Columbia, and if the German department sincerely wishes to attract more than its badly waningnumber of majors, the decision te fire Mr. Singer will be reconsidered. James Wilentz '72 March 1, 1971"
231,Freshman English Seminar To Concentrate on One Work,11 March 1971,"By GARY FRIEDMANThe new English A seminars, which were approved last month by the College faculty, will concentrate on one reading throughout a semester like the current English ClOO3 course, the office of Associate Professor George Stade, departmental representative, revealed yesterday. The new course, which will replace the present two semester, two point freshman composition course, will carry three points and last for only one semester. The seminar was originally partof the proposals of the Committee on Educational Policy, chaired by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap. The course will be taught by an interdepartmental staff structured along the lines of the Humanities A and Contemporary Civilization A staffs. The English office stated that one half of the freshman class will take the seminar during the fall term, and the other half will take it in the spring. The order will be determined alphabetically, as it is for the present Humanities B courses. In addition, remedial sections will be formed for those students who received less than 500 on the Verbal Scholastic Aptitude Test. These sections will be similar to the present freshman English course, which often requires students to write one essay per week on varied topics. Much of the Syllabus is decided by individual instructors. In the present system, a student receiving a score of 700 or more in the verbal SAT is allowed to take a qualifying test for the course English ClOO3, a freshman seminar. Given during Freshman Week, the test usually consists of one essay topic."
232,Humanities A Staff to Include 7 Full Professors Next Year,8 April 1971,"By FRED SCHNEIDERThe Humanities A staff will include seven full professors from six different departments next year, Professor of English John Rosenberg, chairman of the program, announced yesterday. Professor Rosenberg stated that the increase in the number of tenured men from four this year is a continuation of a trend, since there were only three professors teaching sections of the course in 1968. He also announced that the number of sections of the course is being reduced from 45 to 36 as a result of the elimination of Humanities A as a required course for undergraduate engineering students. The professors who will be teaching the course next year include Professor of German Joseph P. Bauke, Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap, Professor of Spanish Leonardo C. De Morelos, Professor of English Wallace A. Gray, Professor of French Nathan Gross, Professor of Greek and Latin Howard N. Porter, and Professor Rosenberg, who did not teach a section this year. In addition, Associate Professor of English Sacvan Bercovitch may join the staff next year. In the past few years, the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities courses have been frequently criticized because of the dearth of tenured professors teaching them. The staff chairman declared that professors' interest in the Humanities course increased this year when the College faculty rejected a proposal to replaceHumanities A, Contemporary Civilization, and Freshman English with a ten-point freshman seminar. ""This proved that general education is still at the center of the College curriculum,"" the English professor stated. ""With the realization that the program will survive, the staff's morale is very high."" Disputing the claim that the Humanities staff included many senior men when it was first organized in the late 1930'5, Professor Rosenberg said that ""a myth exists about the past."" He claimed that while the names of such eminent men as University Professor Lionel Trilling appear on the list of the original members of the staff, they were non-tenured at the time. ""It was Mr. Lionel Trilling who was on the Humanities staff,"" the English professor explained. He also revealed that the practice of including a free reading period following the Easter vacation will continue next year. ""The staff members who were in favor of going back to the structured reading list • were in the minority. The Committee on Instruction approved the majority's recommendation to continue the current practice of allowing each section to decide the readings for the period following the Easter vacation,"" Professor Rosenberg stated. Commenting on the Humanities program, the staff chairman stated, ""In general, Humanities has had fewer problems than CC in attracting tenured people."""
233,Restructuring the divisions: a proposal,18 October 1971,"By MICHAEL LANDASeveral months ago, Dean Hovde, in an effort to stimulate discussion about the future of undergraduate education at Columbia, issued his memorandum on ""The Organization of Undergraduate Instruction."" In his paper the Dean recommended that Columbia College, General Studies and the School of Engineering be merged intd a single undergraduate institution, under the administration of the College. The plan drew little favorable public reaction and appeared to die in print. President McGill asserted that the document ""was political rather than educational in nature. The central problem in our undergraduate institutions is educational reform. I see very little in this proposal that suggests any sort of introspection in this area."" (Spectator, 12-1-70.) General Studies students, faculty members and administrators rejected out of hand the amalgamation set forth in the memorandum. Dean Warner called the plan ""a straight grab by the College.. I think Mr. Hovde is interested in only one thing—coeducation. We have it and the College wants it. ...There is absolutely no educational reform discussed at all, no question of values."" (Spectator, 12-1-70.) The Engineers also reacted hostilely, pointing out that engineering students, who are now treated as second-class students by the College, have no reason to expect a fair deal from a single undergraduate institution controlled by non-Engineering faculty and administrators. They note that from 1914 to 1959, when the Engineering School admitted only junior students from the College, there was almost always a shortage of applicants. As the College was .-unable to provide enough undergraduates for the Engineering School, the ""professional option"" program was extended to included 63 liberal arts colleges in the United States. Even so, the number of undergraduates continued to be insufficient and in 1959 the faculty reinstituted the freshman admission . program, unused for over forty years. Since 1959 the Engineering student body had increased in size and is better qualified (/in terms of test scores) than ever before. Engineers understandably see no reason to return to the pre-1959 relationship; there was never any willingness at that time on the part of the College to increase the number of preengineering students and engineers do not now see any such willingness. The Hovde plan did not deal directly with Barnard, but Columbia and Barnard's different ""educational philosophies"" and issues of faculty hiring and job security are major problems to be overcome before the two schools can seriously consider a merger. In addition, there are some at Barnard who favor the present set-up because they oppose coeducation. Barnard should remain a girls' school, they say, because women receive a better education in a non-coed situation than in a coed one. Shortly after the Hovde plan arrived stillborn off the presses, President McGill suggested that the College establish a two year undergraduate degree program for those students who desire to go directly into professional school. The idea that four years of college before professional or graduate school are not necessary is hardly a new oneLhe improved quality of high school education has led many to argue that the first year of college is redundant for a lot of students-yet Columbia on the whole reacted as if to heresy. Dean Hovde stated that while he admired the President's boldness in raising the issue, he thought that there were ""profound misconceptions in the proposal about thenature and purpose of what we try to do and conceive ourselves as doing in Columbia College."" (Spectator, 12-11-70.) The implication was clear: only under the present Columbia College educational program is a man properly educated, and only in four years can Columbia College give a man that proper education. That same day Spectator approvingly quoted, in an editorial, one professor who said that President McGill's proposal is ""just what one would expect from a mathematical psychologist who doesn't know anything about the humanities and social sciences."" Apparently, only nonscientists are qualified to prescribe educational policy. In response to all this snobbery President McGill later stated that he was not serious about his proposal, that he only wanted to initiate a ""dialogue"" on undergraduate education at Columbia. While I have little sympathy for those who so arrogantly dismissed the McGill proposal, I fully agree with those who oppose the Hovde plan. Columbia College is an extremely stodgy place. True, the troglodytic faculty is quite tolerant of radical politics--but only a radical politics that focuses on non-educational, non-Columbia, off-campus issues. Even violence, as long as it is somewhere else, is regarded as less distasteful than proposals for academic reform. When, on occasion, a decision is made to look at some aspect of the College's educational program, a committee call floats out of the Dean's office, and some faculty members and students, none of whom would every seriously consider anything other than mild tinkering with the status quo, join together to issue a report assuring us that this is the best of all possible worlds. Left-liberal abroad, conservative-reactionary at home, the College has long been a bastion of educational conservatism. No advocate of reform should agree to become part of the Hovde-plan's College-dominated undergraduate institution. General Studies, which encourages innovationand allows flexibility in its programs, has every reason to believe that such a combined undergraduate school would do nothing more than drag everyone else into the morass of conservatism so loved by the College. The Engineering School, on the upswing, increasingly confident of its abilities, has every reason to believe that, under the Hovde plan, engineering students would be given short shrift. The Hovde plan is unacceptable. But there are good reasons for amalgamation, and we ought not let one ill-conceived memorandum keep us from developing other plans for the unification of Columbia College, General Studies, and the Engineering School. The economic waste caused by duplication in the three schools cannot continue. The university cannot afford the drain on our resources caused, for example, by the rivalries that exist between the College and General Studies English Departments. Ultimately financial considerations will force amalgamation. But why let money determine the change. Why not plan for a single degree-granting undergraduate school at Columbia? I submit for your consideration a plan for a substantially new Columbia University College, 'to take the place of Columbia College, General Studies, and the School of Engineering. 1 propose that Columbia College, the School of General Studies, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science be joined to form one coeducational University College with four sub-divisions-a School of Humanities, a School of Social Science, a School of Pure Science and a School of Engineering and Applied Science. This College, which would grant both the BA and the BS, would have a central administration and one admissions office. Admissions University College would offer admissions to high school seniors (men and women), transfer students (men and women) from two and four year colleges, ... and of achoolior say,a minimum of two years. In order to ensure that the last mentioned are admitted in significant numbers, it should be University College policy that not more than three-quarters of the student body shall be recent high school graduates or transfer students. Applicants would be asked to indicate a field of interest (this is now done in Columbia College) and the central admissions office would ensure that each SchoolHumanities, Social Science, Pure Science, and Engineering and Applied Science—received a certain minimum' number of students. Given that this' College would contain within it students of diverse backgrounds and different ages, test scores and grades would obviously not be the only admissions criteria. At General Studies, the interview is an extremely important part of the admissions process; the five-year old test scores and grades of a twentythree year old applicant are properly not considered the most important criteria. The University College would have to study carefully the ways in which General Studies currently evaluates prospective students. Com men t CC and Engineering students would fit easily into Universit College, as would full and part time GS degree candidates. Given lour, five, six, seven years to take the degree, students would be able to work their way through school, as they now do. Provisions could also be made lor GS special students and university employees. School Transfer Once accepted by University College, any student would be free to move about from one School to another Comment At present, CC and GS stuuenis are tree to move in and out of arts and sciences departments but not engineering departments. Engineering students are free to move in and out of engineering departments but not arts and sciences departments. In order to major in chemical or electrical engineering, a CC or GS student must transfer to the School of Engineering; in order to major in chemistry or political science, an Engineering student must transfer to CC or GS. Under the University College plan, the student who, on the basis of his application, was placed in the School of Pure Science, could, if he decided to °be a chemical engineer rather than a chemist, simply become a student in the School of Engineering. Conversely, the chemical engineer who decided to be a chemist could simply become a student in the School of Pure Science. Curriculum There would be two sets of requirements for the BA or BS degree: a College distribution requirement, set by the College faculty, and a School requirement, set by the faculty of each School, and approved by the College faculty. (A College COI could handle questions of distribution requirements and programs between Schools; School COIs could handle School requirements and other intra-School matters.) School Requirements There would be no departmental requirements in the College (except in the School of Engineering and Applied Science) but a student would do most of his academic work within one School. Instead of majoring in a given subject, he would be free to develop, in consultation with advisors, an interdisciplinary program of study, drawing on the departments in his School and, occasionally, in other Schools. I leave the question of a required program open. It may be that, given the interdependent nature of say, the sociaL sciences, astudent could merely be required to take a certain number of eourses within one School in order to receive the BA or BS. At the very least, however, School requirements should include topical seminars lor freshmen. These could serve as introductory courses, prerequisites lor more advanced work. If there were broad enough in scope, such courses could also give the first-year student a taste of more than one discipline. Thus, a freshman seminar on eighteenth-century European society might include readings in history, literature, and philosophy. Distribution Requirements There would be no core curriculum in the College, but a student would be required to take a minimum number of courses, perhaps one-sixth to one-eighth of the total, outside his School. The School of Social Science student might, for example, have to take two or three courses in the School of Pure Science and three to four courses in the School of Humanities. Required distribution courses would not necessarily be freshman and sophomore courses; some of themjnight be specifically third or fourth year courses. First and second year students would then be free to study what they wanted, rightaway. Moreover, it's not unlikely that a third year School of Science student would derive more from a School of Humanities course than his freshman counterpart. For when the latter is forced to read Plato rather than study what interests him at firstchemistry, biology, physics-he comes to regard Plato as a roadblock to be detoured as quickly as possible, in order to begin study in chemistry, biology, physics. If the student were allowed to do work in his field of interest right away, and required to take Plato in his junior or senior year, he would find school a productive experience early in his academic career and, after fairly intensive study in one area, might find Plato a refreshing and worthwhile capstone to his college education. Comment The proposed University College curriculum differs from the current educational programs of the Engineering School, GS, and CC. Engineering students would have to meet departmental requirements, as they now do, but instead of taking Contemporary Civilization and Humanities courses, they would have to satisfy a distribution requirement. GS students would still face a distribution requirement, but they would not need to ""major"" in a single subject,as is usually the case now. Much would change for the CC student. The rigid system of liberal arts requirements would go, as would the departmental ""major"" requirement. Of these changes, the latter would be the more difficult for the College Faculty to bear; the former have gradually been relaxed over the last lew years and the faculty might be persuaded to eliminate them entirely.University College's greatest advantage would lie in its flexibility and opportunity lor innovation. Interdisciplinary Institutes, tor example, could easily be arranged between as well as within the lour Schools. For example, the Schools of Pure Science and Social Science might get together and give an Institute on environmental protection and economic development. Biologists, chemists, economists and political scientists would work to learn about environmental pollution, resource management, and their economic and political ramifications in developed and developing countries. The four Schools of the University College might give their students a sense of community, a sense of purpose that is so lacking at Columbia, especially for Columbia College students. At one time Contemporary Civilization and Humanities brought students together, made-the College a community. But now, the required courses elicit only boredom, impatience, and even hostility from students, as anyone who has read the Ted Kramer course evaluation book is well aware. (Lastyear, the Ted Kramer staff wrote: 'in fact, CCA instructors who receive overwhelmingly favorable evaluations are those who either ignore the course altogether or go outside it to make it more meaningful."") Such liberal arts requirements nolonger bind together Columbia College students. On the other hand, membership in a School whose students are interested in similar disciplines, similar approaches and similar problems would do much to make students feel as if they were part of a worthwhile enterprise, an enterprise to which they would contribu and from which they would benefit. The establishment of University College would facilitate a closer relationship between undergraduate and graduate education at Columbia. Many educators have come to believe that the distinctions between upper college and first and second year graduate school are no longer valid, and that undergraduates should be encouraged to do graduate course work in their junior and senior years. Separate courses for juniors and seniors, on the one hand, and first year graduate students, on the other, might not be needed at all. University College, with three Schools (Pure Science, Social Science and Humanities) parallel to the Graduate Faculties, would induce greater cooperation graduate and undergraduate departments. The graduate and undergraduate engineering departments already form one Faculty; this might be the prototype for the creation of a single Arts and Sciences Faculty.Michael Landa '71 is a former College senator in the University Senate. _—- ;—■ ' ' ■ ---» - ~ — - • - -* -—"
234,Course Guide,11 September 1972,"To the Editor: I have been rather pleased to see that the Columbia-Barnard Course Guide has again been well received by the university community. The Course Guide staff hopes that you enjoy our book and consult it frequently and carefully throughout the semester. However, there is one rather serious error to which we would like to draw your attention. On page 229, the evaluation of Mr. David Ackermann's Humanities A section is inaccurate. Both the statistical evaluation and the summary were drawn from the questionnaires to students in both Mr. Ackermann's section and Professor Robert Ackerman's section, and thus give a distorted picture which doesn't truly represent the success of either section. As we are now unable to sort out the questionnaires from each section, it is impossible to do new evaluations for both instructors, but indications are that statistically, at least, there would have been little variation between the ratings for the two instructors.

235,"Humanities, CC: 'They Grow on You'",10 November 1972,"By BEN SHATKIN""When I took Humanities and CC, I thought they were a waste of time,"" one senior remarked earlier this year while dining in John Jay cafeteria. ""Looking back on it, though, I realize those were the most stimulating courses I've ever taken."" ""They kinda grow on you as you get older,"" another senior commented. These two students typify what some people half-jokingly refer to as ""the CC syndrome."" As with bad-tasting medicine, many students seem highly pleased with the controversial required courses —after they've swallowed them. Numerous interviews with College students —from freshmen to seniors—over the past few weeks revealed that students who are currently enrolled in the courses are considerably less pleased with them than students who took the courses earlier in their academic careers. ""CCA is neither worthwhile nor should it be required,"" commented one freshman. ""The Greeks haveno bearing on American society, the reading is boring, and my teacher talks in a monotone."" Senior Lou Venech said he had similar feelings when he was a freshman, but he now says that ""the reading material was extremely valuable."" The reading list in the first year Contemporary Civilization course includes—as it has included throughout the course's fifty-year history—Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, and other philosophers. The fourcredit 'Hum"" course, which is also required for two semesters, offers such works as the ""Iliad,"" the ""Odyssey,"" and the ""Aeneid."" Fresbman David Thomas stated that the courses ""should not be required,"" but added that they are ""worthwhile due to the good quality of the books."" ""You read books you might not normally read,"" he added, echoing the sentiment of several students. David Spector 75, for example, said that ""both CCA and Hum A are definitely worthwhile due to the magnanimous reading selections,"" and Neil Williams 76 commented that ""Hum A provides an insight into ancient and modern books which I wouldn't read if I wasn't required to."" Like many students, however, Spector added that ""some pass-fail arrangement should be worked out"" for the course. Looking back at his freshman year, Tony Herrling 74 maintained that while the courses ""should notbe required, they had some worthwhile aspects."" He said ""the main asset was the small, discussion-oriented classes."" ""I got a lot out of it,"" the junior added. While upperclassmen praised the courses for ""providing a good broad scope and exposing you to many facets of various disciplines,"" some freshmen criticized this aspect of the programs. One claimed that they ""postpone detail in other subject areas and force a quick decision as to one's area of specialization."" Both freshmen and seniors agreed on one point, however: The courses are crucially affected by the quality of the teachers, which, for both courses, are drawn from several academic departments and range from preceptors to chaired professors. Lou Venech commented that ""the popularity can be hurt by the teaching,"" while a freshman exclaimed that ""I hate the courses—my teachers are lousy."" Steven Drucker '76 said that as a potential science major, he found that ""CCA is not worthwhile and definitely should not be required."" He suggested that it should be ""suggested for history majors"" because the course curriculum would provide a good background in history. Members of the College Committee on Instruction—who have been discussing required courses at recent meetingspointed out that the College wantsto provide every student with a well-rounded background. A student member of the instructional panel said that while the College could not hope to turn every graduate into ""a Renaissance man,"" CC and Humanities help lay a basic foundation in general education that is applicable throughout college, not just for non-science majors. No group seems to be more enthusiastic about the courses than the teachers themselves. Former CC Chairman Dwight Miner, Moore Collegiate Professor of History, commented that ""CCA provides a common experience in a time of few common experiences."" ""CCA is not a survey course, but an introductory course which should provide a spiritual awakening,"" he added. Professor Miner also commented that ""the key to Contemporary Civilization is the teacher."" Professor of English John D. Rosenberg, chairman of Humanities A, said that the course ""provides a community of discourse."" He noted that each teacher is allowed to handle the course in his own way, but added that ""the common reading list allows the staff to function as a Unit."" Two major complaints concerning Humanities A have been the length of the reading list and the question of relevancy to modern society. In answer to the question oflength, Professor Rosenberg said that the reading list has been shortened. As far as the question of relevancy is concerned, Professor Rosenberg noted that since 1968 there has been a free reading period after Easter which allows classes time to read contemporary books. He asserted, however, that ""the problem with Thucydides' the 'Peloponnesian War' may be that it is too relevant instead of too remote.""Students listen to an instructor talk about Western thought in a CC class."
236,University Directions II,1 March 1973,"The following statement concerning a University Program of General and Continuing Education in the Humanities has been submitted for consideration by the Educational Policy Committee of the Senate. It may be characterized briefly as follows: 1. It envisages a major reform of the general education program at Columbia, recognizing that this need exists on all levels of university education and not just the undergraduate. 2. It looks to the eventual involvement of the whole University in this effort, but proposes to initiate the process in the Schools of Medicine, Law and Architecture along with the Arts and Sciences. 3. It responds to the demand for accelerating baccalaureate and graduate or professional degree programs without sacrificing liberal education to vocational training. 4. It involves continuing study of the nature of general education in keeping with contemporary trends, taking into account the analysis and recommendations of Daniel Bell's The Reforming of General Education, but considering also the new trends which have emerged since 1967 and have created in some respects a radically new educational situation. 5. It proposes a new kind of ""open university"" within the modern mutliversity—a program of general and continuin education which is open to all students and serves as a meeting ground for the disciplines and professions. The following statement and its appendices develop this outline in greater detail and provide a rationale for the extension of this program from the College to the professional and graduate schools. This plan is the product of long and extensive consultation within the central administration and among appropriate deans. It has been discussed at length with the College Committee on Instruction, and incorporates the suggestions of many faculty colleagues and students. In particular I wish to acknowledge the assistance of Bernard Schoenberg, Michael Sovern, and Susan Ritner in the preparation of this statement. Wm. Theodore deßary Liberal & Vocational Education Today there is a strong trend toward vocational education and pressure for speeding up the educational process. The desire of many young people to become usefully employed and to achieve financial independence early in life, runs head-on into an increasing need for technical competence, and the prospect that education may stretch out indefinitely, at steadily inflating costs, looms with the lengthening demands for specialized training. This trend is reflected on the level of national educational policy in the heavy emphasis on vocationallyoriented education and the acceleration of degree programs of all sorts. The repeated articulation of these goals by the Commissioner of Education and their embodiment in both Federal and State legislation, against the background of increasing dependence of so-called private education on public support, gives a somewhat ominous aspect to the planning and coordinating activities which are envisaged by some under the Federal Education Amendments of 1972, especially in the form of the state commissions which would rationalize the allocation of all public funds expended for education. It is easy to see in this trend a threat to liberal education and the humanities, as most likely to be expendable in the process. It is more difficult to respond to this challenge with a genuine reconstruction of liberal education, suited to the actual circumstances we face today. One can man the ramparts against public interference in private education; against vocationalism and technological specialization as opposed to the humanities; against shortsighted social utility as opposed to eternal verities. But toA Program of General and Continuing Education in the Humanitiesdo so would be a losing struggle against both irreversible trends and imaginary antagonists. ""Eternal verities"" endure only to the extent that they can be adapted to new human situations. In the midst of these strong and inescapable trends toward specialization and vocationalism in the work of the University, it is essential that the humane values and concerns underlying every branch of learning be rearticulated. The humanities can no longer be thought of as limited to studies of high cultural traditions and their literary expression. They go beyond the latter in affirming that the human aspect of things should remain a central concern on virtually every level of educational and cultural endeavor, from college to graduate and professional school. Humanities in this sense include what has been known as general education (including the Contemporary Civilization Program in Columbia College), but also enter into even specialized branches of knowledge insofar as the latter bear upon the perennial problems of human life. While recognizing the need for general education as an essential part of the undergraduate experience, we also realize that no such experience can be isolated from the complexities of the contemporary world which are reflected in the expanding fields of knowledge to which graduate and professional education address themselves. What we propose then is a program of general and continuing education with its base in the college experience but its core extending upward into advanced fields of study, so that the trunk and branches of the university tree feed and sustain each other's growth. The Renewal of General Education To revive and renew general education in the humanities today we must reckon with changes in our situation over the last several decades: 1. The trend toward specialization and vocationalism reflects not only social changes but the vast expansion of knowledge and the individual's difficulty in coping with it. There seems to be no way of achieving a sense of mastery or individual competence except by cutting out for one's self some manageable segment of the whole. 2. There is less and less plausibility to the idea that one can define a liberal education by circumscribing a body of knowledge in such terms as ""what every educated man ought to know."" 3. Survey courses, to the degree that they imply extensive coverage and generality rather than selectivity in regard to values and priorities, do not serve the purposes of general education. 4. It is not practicable or desirable to think of general education or education in the humanities (broadly conceived) as something done in the first years of college and then gradually yielding to specialization. The needs of different programs vary and uniformity cannot be enforced; if there are any educational constants to be observed, they are found in the need for both specialized training in certain disciplines' and liberal education in the humanities to start from the first years of college and continue throughout university education. 5. Because of the increasingly technological character of our society and the rapidity of social change, with a consequent bewildering flux in shared values, it is vital that undergraduates have some common experience of the humanities as a basis for their continuing education. There should, however, be a recognition that this process spreads outward from a human center and the humane scholar continues to be concerned with questions of value in the midst of increasingly specialized studies on the frontiers of advancing knowledge. 6. For many students the relevance of the ""humanities"" may be best appreciated in relation to the study of contemporary social, scientific or technological problems in concrete form. An effective program in the humanities will seek to involve scholars and scientists capable of bridging the gap between shared human concerns and new discoveries in the forefront of scholarship. 7. A reasonable sequence embodying the foregoing principles would start with core courses (represented at Columbia by the Humanities with a capital H and possiblyalso Contemporary Civilization A) which identify the enduring concerns and problems of human life as expressed in major works and thinkers. It would then move on to a range of courses in which these concerns were given practical application in relation to contemporary human problems. Given the potential variety of such applications, and the need for differentiation in terms of the disciplines relevant to the solution of these problems, education in the humanities as related to contemporary society could extend indefinitely upward and outward from the base established in Humanities A and B. This kind of secondlevel differentiated study in the humanities and contemporary society should form part of the undergraduate experience. It should also be the subject of continuing education for graduate and professional students as well as alumni. 8. The Humanities courses in Columbia College have served their function well, and give us a base on which to build. Humanities A in particular can be considered one of the durable successes of general education in America, in contrast to more highly publicized ""great books"" programs which may have overreached themselves and encountered difficulty adapting to contemporary needs. 9. Today the Humanities cannot be upheld or reaffirmed except in a global context. The human community today is a world community and though it comprises distinct traditions (which must be respected for their distinctiveness) it no longer makes sense to speak of the humanities except in the context of the totality of human experience. Much of the informal and irregular education among young people today breaks with the concept of the Humanities as based solely on the Western tradition, and takes delight in emancipating itself from what appears to be a hide-bound and parochial view of the world. Columbia has led in developing materials for the study of the humanities in the Oriental traditions, but it has not made full use of them in the general education program. What is needed to provide general education in the humanities, as outlined above, is a fuller mobilization of the intellectual resources of the University and the establishment of mechanisms to facilitate and integrate contributions from existing units of academic organization into a University-wide program. Many scholars in the University recognize this need, but find it difficult, without central leadership and support, to overcome the pressures toward disciplinary specialization. They sense the trend toward intellectual fragmentation and its dangers, but do not know what to do about it when everything in the contemporary educational world propels us into intense competition in increasingly specialized fields. Throughout the University in its graduate and professional schools there are distinguished scholars and teachers whose instructional assignments have been confined —often by inadvertence and as a consequence of the artificial boundaries among schools with separate degree programs —to the graduate level. And yet their intellectual breadth and stature, as well as the vitality of their thinking and the depth of their human concern, are often such as to suit them admirably for the discussion of human issues in their contemporary context, drawing on the special competence which they can bring to bear on the analysis and solution of certain problems. Scholars wellestablished in their disciplines are often ready to explore new ways of looking at problems from the viewpoint of other disciplines or in association with colleagues in other departments. Bound by the conventional limits of schools interests and disciplinary training, however, administrators have not been encouraged to think in larger terms of the contribution their faculty could make to the University as a whole or how access to a great teacher might be opened to many students interested in the quality and range of a scholar's mind even when they are not professionally committed to his discipline. We have accepted the view that there is a gulf between graduate and undergraduate teaching and the twain should not be expected to meet.Perennial Concerns and Contemporary Problems From the standpoint of undergraduate education the question should be viewed first in terms of the perennial concerns and problems of human life and what forms they take in the contemporary world, and second in terms of those disciplines which may contribute to an understanding, and possibly a solution, of them. This implies a recognition that the problems to be dealt with in a contemporary context are manifold, that no attempt should be made to embrace them in an omnibus course or survey, and that a variety of instructional options in topics, format and teaching methods should be available to serve the purposes of general education beyond the introductory level. These would form a list of hybrid and hyphenated courses: e.g., Humanities-Law, Humanities-Sociology, HumanitiesEngineering, etc., with a variety of instructional approaches and class sizes. From the standpoint of graduate or professional education the aim should be to demonstrate the relevance of a specialized discipline to basic human needs and to acknowledge the interdependence of the disciplines in seeking to meet them. In terms of content and approach, however, such courses would be addressed not to professionals or ""majors"" but to inquiring minds seeking to know the nature of the contribution which a discipline can make to understanding of the human self and man in society. If we can proceed on this basis we shall be in a position to exploit a wide range of competences and be able also to honor that kind of scholarly competence which is adorned by a breadth of humane learning and inspirited by a depth of human concern. The question of whether the humanities so conceived are offered on the graduate or undergraduate level is less important substantively than pedagogically. It may be decided on the basis of whether or not one wishes a homogeneity of background among the students in a class, so that theey share a common world of discourse for discussion purposes. As illustrations of appropriate subjects we might cite the state, bureaucracy, urbanism, political movements and organization, social protest and revolution, problems of educational, judicial and penal reform, of industrialism and agrarianism, technology, and the environment; of community planning, the family, ethnicity and ethnic relations, housing, health and welfare systems. If these are obvious examples of problems with a strong social orientation, there are other topics directed more toward the problems of the individual: individual freedoms and rights, the individual in his biological, psychological and spiritual dimensions, his need for aesthetic expression and so on. Both might well converge in a course degisnated in terms of, for example, ""Architecture as a Human Statement."" These are perennial and universal concerns in the sense that they can be found in most societies, past and present. They can be dealt with both historically and contemporarily, and in many cases should be. Though we do not hesitate to stress the importance of their contemporary relevance, and the desirability of having as direct an involvement as possible with the problems that surround us, it is equally important that these problems be seen in a larger perspective and against a wide background of human experience. The social problems of New York should be seen in a context which includes Tokyo and Shanghai, its bureaucratic problems in the perspective of Byzantium and Peking. There is no reason to exclude from consideration courses presented in an historical framework (e.g., Roman, Indian, or Chinese civilizations) or problems in intellectual history, philosophy or religion which focus on perennial issues in different settings. Examples could be given from existing offerings to demonstrate the impressive resources adaptable to the purposes of general education (an illustrative list is attached). New offerings should be devised, attacking persistent problems in new ways, intellectually and pedagogically. For instance, cultural convergence in the contemporary world brings acupuncture, yoga and otheer forms of physical culture and treatment side-by-side with Western medicine. In the kinds of study needed to grasp the presuppositions of seemingly occult sciences few can claim to be experts. But in a university with anthropological and foreign area and cultural studies, the medical researcher might get help in grasping conceptions of man and forms of human experience differing from his own. Indeed, it may only be in the liberal university of the West that this kind of cross-fertilization can take place on a conceptual level. Acupuncture may be practiced in China today, but its theoretical and conceptual basis remains an unstudied enigma there. New Patterns of Education There should be a steady regeneration of the humanities program through infusions of new blood, in terms of both personnel and courses. No teacher should feel indentured to the system indefinitely. On the other hand there should be a reasonable expectation of sufficient continuity to insure that the work which goes into the preparation of a course would not soon be shelved. In some cases this assurance could be gained by having a senior professor and preceptor work together, with one carrying on after the other has withdrawn. Provision should also be made for the preparation of texts and course materials with the prospect of publication. An editorial staff and publication program could facilitate wide dissemination of such materials. Junior staff members would have an opportunity to publish which served both their pedagogic needs and professional advancement. Decentralization of the work among smallinstructional teams should stimulate productivity, as compared to the inherent cumbersomeness of large committees presiding over omnibus courses. Time off could be given for the preparation of texts and readers which would serve both the educational effort and the need particularly of junior staff members for the kind of opportunity provided by the Chamberlain fellowships. A University-wide coordinating committee should link the several schools and their respective committees on instruction to identify suitable participants in the program and give them appropriate assistance. It should also be possible to include special lecturers whose competence and experience is seen as relevant to the subject of a course, but who are not regular members of the faculty. New York City, and the alumni of the University, represent a great reservoir of talent that could well be tapped for general and continuing education in the humanities. Special professorships, lectureships and preceptorships should be established to encourage and support the participation of qualified teachers. The use of three week intersessions in winter and late spring should be explored in terms of their suitability for short courses which could be taken as a supplement to one's regular academic-year program of study or teaching. During this break from the regular routine one could extend his intellectual horizons beyond his field of specialization, taking advantage of instruction that fully measures up to academic standards and that carries degree credit wherever appropriate and needful. How such courses would be certified by each faculty, how they would fit into students' programs, what requirements they would satisfy —these matters would be decided by each faculty and committee on instruction. In Columbia College it would seem unnecessary, at the outset, to modify existing requirements, as long as the new courses could be included among the options available under the present requirements. The addition of general education courses in inter- or Summer School offerings not only would provide possibilities for enrichment of established degree programs, but could 1) make it possible for those students who wished to accelerate baccalaureate programs to obtain a college degree in three years, without necessarily sacrificing all vacations or opportunities for summer employment, or 2) accelerate combined undergraduate and professional degree programs wihout sacrificing a liberal education. Appended to this statement are proposals for humanities programs in two of our major professional schools, Law and Medicine. A third appendix lists specimens of existing or projected inter-disciplinary courses in the arts and sciences, as well as in other professional schools, which approximate what we aim at and could be enhanced by a coordinated, University-wide program. Initial Phase of Planning and Development Our objectives for 1973-74 are: 1. To establish a University-wide coordinating council which will link the deans and committees on instruction in their efforts to plan courses and establish general policies and standards for the cooperative program. We expect that some schools may wish to set up advisory committees of interested faculty and students to participate in the planning process. 2. To organize a Seminar on General Education and the Humanities for regular discussion of the educational issues underlying program planning. Informal discussion in recent weeks has revealed a large interest in questions of educational philosophy and a readiness of many leading faculty members to join in this dialogue. The likelinhood is that this will be held on a weekday at noon, from 12 to 2, in the Faculty House or the Kellogg Center. A seminar committee would plan the sessions and over-see publication of the papers produced. Students would be invited to participate. 3. To plan and produce a pilot group of general education courses in the humanities for the fall and spring semesters on the principles outlined in this statement. These would probably be in the areas of the humanistic bases of medicine, science and technology, human biology, law, architecture, sociology, political science, philosophy, art history and oriental studies. 4. To plan a group of pilot courses for new intersession programs. There are numerous and varied possibilities; we intend to be highly selective at the start, and will probably continue to be so (this applies to No. 3 as well). 5. To plan a three year A.B. degree program as an option for undergraduates, with a full general education component. 6. To develop a fellowship-grant program which would enable faculty and students to engage in special studies in the humanities as a preparation for teaching in general education courses, for the actual planning of such courses, and for the production of teaching materials and syllabi. 7. To plan a scholarship program for selected students who would elect the three year A.B. degree, and possibly combine this with pre-professional work and professional training on the graduate level. Conscience and Competence The program outlined above is a major reformulation of an old idea. What is new about it is the extension of the general education concept to a large multiversity, and the generating of a unifying force which might make of it more truly a university. The arrangements it envasages do not represent a drastic intrusion upon the existing structure of the University. The need is to implant or graft a new growth onto the existing educational activity in such a way that it strengthens and enlivens all its parts. This depends for its success, however, on thecooperation of those who recognize the need for a new educational spirit and a new intellectuality in our university, in the nation and indeed in the world. Not everyone will subscribe to this view or respond to the challenge. There has already been enough turmoil and change on the campus, some will say. Those disillusioned by the failure of great hopes for reform in recent years will remain skeptical. Others, fatigued by endless discussions of curriculum reform and university governance, will want only to get back to their own scholarship and teaching. They will reassure themselves that the forces of ungoverned protest have spent themselves. Antiintellectualism and political dogmatism no longer run unchecked. With peace returning to the campus, they are eager to resume undisturbed research and untrammeled scholarship. For them the lesson of the recent campus revolt is only that genuine academic values have survived the ordeal with flying colors. One needs now only to hold high the banner of excellence, scholarly discipline and academic standards. To say this, however, without recognizing that a basic educational need remains unmet, is to misconceive the nature of the struggle. The house of intellect cannot be defended as if it were exposed only to attack from without, when, long before the Vietnam War intruded on academia, the signs of disaffection and disillusionment were already evident within. A return to the good old days is not possible, and the impossibility has less to do with our present difficulties —budget deficits, political pressures and external interference —than with the simple fact that the old days were not that good, and the foundations of the academic enterprise were already shaky. Neglect of general education in favor of high-powered specialization was already beginning to take its toll, as students shrank back from success-oriented careers, and could only ""find"" themselves or grope for their bearings through endless, aimless wanderings away from the university. Students were draft-resisters well before the war —refusing to step forward into the professional rat-race or compete for academic honors. For them academia had already lost any semblance of integrity, precisely because its integrative forces were seen to lose ground everywhere in the curriculum, in the teaching process and in budgetary decisions. The situation today has changed, but only to a degree. Students are more realistic, more serious, more hardworking. But one cannot say that the malaise has been cured. Some observers report that students have turned inward, and simply go about their own business. Others see apathy and indifference pervading the scene. Aimlessness and meninglessness still undermine the motivation of many students. A dearth of leadership and distrust of leaders reflects a lack of consensus on common goals and the means to achieve them. Who can be hopeful of better things when there is a pervading sense of aimlessness in the heart of the university? To cite the need for common goals and values is easier, of course, than to provide the educational means for arriving at them. The complexity of the problems themselves has led us away from questions of value and toward the refinement of the scholarly or scientific means of analyzing, if not of dealing with, them. General education seems to many inherently unstable and the discussion of human values or social goals is always somewhat vague and inconclusive. Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, we must try to cope with them or be condemned to a worse fate. Students conclude that a university which so avoids questions of values and priorities is indifferent to human needs, insensitive to suffering, incapable of facing up to its moral and social responsibilities. The university appears non-committal and ""value-free"", when, for undergraduates looking to it for leadership, it should appear ""value-full."" Lest we be misunderstood, the point of this argument is not that one should fly in the face of our own recent experience, reject the requirements of intellectual discipline, and by the mere assertion of our moral will, put conscience ahead of competence in the curriculum. We must find new ways of meeting the need for general education which take into account the weaknesses and failings of earlier attempts. No one can afford, for instance, to ignore the claims of professional competence and disciplinary training. Students, no less than their teachers, recognize these claims because without some such competence they can make no contribution of their own to the problems that concern us. Hence their wish to understand these problems in human terms today goes hand-in-hand with the preparation needed to deal with them in specific terms tomorrow. What this means is that general education and disciplinary training must be thought of as complementary and parallel pursuits, not competing or divergent ones. The former view of general education as a broadening experience in the early years of college, followed by intensive specialization, must give way to a conception of general education as continuing in later years, and of specialized training as starting earlier, alongside of general education, for those ready to make that commitment. What we cannot yield to is the widespread pressure from both foundations and government to speed up the whole process and hasten the acquisition of degrees in a fewer number of years, very probably at the expense of any liberal education. There is room for—and indeed much to be gained by—advancing the practical employment of one's skills in professional work and teaching. But we cannot surrender liberal education to the demands for a speed-up in the production of technicians. Our approach to the problem should be not to speed up the assembly line but to get education off the treadmill of routine professionalism and onto the doubletrack of disciplined competence and humane learning.

237,"Diogenes says: ""Cheer up, Columbia""",1 May 1973,"""Cheer up, Columbia""By PETER R. POUNCEYThere is a story in Plutarch's Life of Alexander to the effect that, before his expedition against Persia, the youthful Alexander came to a congress of the Greeks at the Isthmus, and there received the homage of ""many statesmen and philosophers"". However, Diogenes of Sinope, the early Cynic who lived in Corinth at the time, was conspicuously absent. Unable to explain this to himself, the king went to look for the cantankerous old sage and found him sunbathing. Alexander stood in front of him and asked if he could do anything for him, and Diogenes said: ""Yes, get out of my sunlight."" For some reason such casual plain-speaking made a powerful impression on Alexander, and he remarked that if he were not Alexander there was no one he would rather be than Diogenes. It is clear that in the biographer's mind, at least, the two characters represent two polarities: on the one hand, the handsome and gifted empire-builder, full of the enthusi-iasms of youth, who would later weep for more worlds to conquer, and on the other the crusty old philosopher, who gave his nickname of ""the Dog"" to a whole movement, and espoused a life-style of minimum requirements as the key to happiness. Plutarch elsewhere tells us that the two men died on the same day, which may, or may not, indicate that there is no more mileage in cynicism than there is in youthful enthusiasm and empire-building. At all events, if one looks carefully, with an exegetic eye, at Diogenes spread on his motheaten rug, one detects a certain sense of style in the old bastard, amounting almost to exhibitionism. Talking about minimum requirements, what is so necessary about a few seconds of sunlight, especially in sun-drenched Central Greece? At Columbia, it is often said by students in the dorms, designed, they say, by an architect morbidly conditioned by Humanities A to blend the more oppressive features of Dante's Inferno'with Kafka's diseased imaginings, there is no problem of fulfilling the physical ideal of cynicism; if anything the problem is to raise the standard of living to the level of the minimum requirements. But that ispart of Columbia's power: the decks are, as it were, cleared of all encumbrances to pure thought. So let us not speak of physical deprivations but rather of cynicism as a state of mind. There is a sense in which one would express the Cynic ideal of minimum requirements as a positive intellectual goal. In this sense one could be talking of the avoidance of intellectual clutter, in the spirit of Holmes telling Watson that he would make every effort to forget a useless bit of information which the ponderous Doctor had offered him. We can concede the desirability of this, even if we don't accept Holmes' view of memory as a limited amount of storage-space, in which only items of solid value should be retained. But it is a rather circumscribed virtue: trivia are almost by definition harmless, and most minds, if they were driven by guilt to eradicate them, would have precious little to proffer instead. In the early days of television, the BBC used to wind up its daily programming at 11:18 p.m. with a three minute piece entitled ""Athought for the day"". This was stuck ciimactically in between the weather forecast (""Occasional rain and sunny periods"") and God Save the Queen. Each ""thought"" was purveyed by a person in a dark suit (few women), and the same person had to purvey a thought for five week-days in a row (thinking being either too strenuous or too highly paid at the weekend). It was fascinating to watch the disintegration of each thinker in the course of the week: the voice on Monday would be resonant with conviction, the eyes direct and challenging, but as one moved towards Friday the speech would slur, and the glance become furtive and evasive, as some craven banality dropped apologetically off the tube. The series was eventually abandoned, having, in many people's view, dangerously depleted England's brain reserves. Some of this deserves consideration by those who complain of Columbia's stringent academic requirements. If we did not offer thoughts to think . . . However, there is a more valuable ""Cynical"" ideal for the intellect than the mere quantitative limitation of matter to be digested. There should be an economy not so much to what the mind gives its attention to, but to the actual operations of mind. One sees examples of this occasionally and it is always impressive. Meyer Schapiro, in Low Library, of all places, that platitudinous replica of Agrippa's Pantheon, can take a medieval picture of a lion, and show that although the beast is rather chunkily horizontal within a vertical frame, and although at first thought this seems a rather anomalous arrangement, further examination shows that the frame has been adjusted to absorb and extend details of the picture, and that to tamper with the composition in any way in the interests of a visual logic is to weaken it. Something like that. The point has large implications in the history of art, we realize, but it is conveyed so simply and exemplified so clearly that we are not immediately aware how much is distilled. Basically he just makes us see.lt is marvelous. This intellectual economy is perhaps most often found in mathematicians—most of the campus missed a remarkable demonstration of it the other day by Samuel Eilenberg, in a lecture entitled Comments On Computation —he is a truly intellectual cynic, in the best sense of the word. But it is the negative aspects of cynicism to which we should perhaps give greater attention: they are certainly evident in greater abundance. I do not merely mean that there is a notable absence of Alexander's youthful enthusiasm on the campus, though there has been precious little joy in education in recent years. This is partially because public events have obtruded into the tranquility of the ivory tower (and rightly so—they are such events!) and partially because the process of education itself, has been for undergraduates increasingly distorted by the uncertainties of the job market at the endwhole, they cannot come to much good. We can see this in our friends on the Daily - Voyeur, those small scurrilous gnomes, who, lacking the stature for Cassandra, have boldly cast themselves as Thersites. We can see it also in the ""faculty""; as one strolls the long corridors, the grey glass doors betoken emptiness. Where have they gone? They have gone home to Riverside Drive, to weigh their offers from New Paltz, all except Sidney Morgenbesser who is in my office with another scheme. And finally, alas, we can see it also in the ""Administration,"" that Byzantine legacy of the Butler autocracy, which, to borrow a good line from my predecessor, has grown adept at ""building fences for unicorns while foddering wolves"". What can be done about this? It may beof it. Why lament this? It the times have produced some sense of urgency to question what we do, we should accept it and not pine for some Edwardian grove of Academe, where owls upon ancestral battlements are paid more heed than signs which spell the advent of the war to end all wars. There are more damaging indications of cynicism than sombreness. The most damaging of all is the mental weariness which accepts without question the limited categories of the past—let us not exert ourselves for after all we are pledged to a life of minimum requirements. A good* 1 example of this at Columbia is the automatic assumption that every university, like Gaul, is divided into three parts—Administration, faculty and students. The three elements lie scattered in our jaded consciousness like relics ofsome anatomical dissection abandoned as unprofitable or uninteresting. Over the years, each element has picked up some Homeric epithets to serve as predicates in our ritualistic formulae. Thus the administration is always inept (and probably corrupt), the faculty is supine and aloof, and the students are generally noisy and unpleasant. The epithets used by each of the elements a propos of the other two vary, of course, but the basic divisions between them are accepted by all three. Common to all three, as they dyspeptically survey each other, is the assumption that, taken as atoo much to hope that the three limbs of the old cadaver will soon converge again and form a university, a word which, in laughably distant days, used to convey a certain wholeness. I would suggest as a cautious opening step that we should turn in our Homeric epithets and substitute a new set with more positive resonance. These may not be enough to infuse passion into the old withered limbs, but they may help them twitch occasionally with the semblance of life. More importantly, they may be truer than the old set. So then, thinking positively, I would say that the students at Columbia display an extraordinary range of talent and interests, and fill the classrooms with some of the most interesting groups to teach that one could find anywhere in the country. I would say, and have in fact often said, that the faculty is extraordinarily"
238,Dwight Miner to Retire After Half-Century Here,16 May 1973,"By RICHARD BRIFFAULTOn September 28, 1922, Warren G. Harding was in the White House, Nicholas Murray Butler was President of Columbia, tennis courts covered the ground where Butler Library and John Jay Hall now stand, and 17-year-old Dwight C. Miner walked into his first Contemporary Civilization class. Next month, Dwight Miner, College student and faculty member, the foremost authority on the history of the university, and currently the Moore Collegiate Professor of History, will retire after almost fifty-one years at Columbia. In a ninty-minute interview in his Hamilton Hall office last week, Professor Miner reflected on his years at Columbia, discussed the many changes he had witnessed, and vigorously expounded on the history and virtues of the College's academic program.Noting that he could not really differentiate between his years as a student and those spent teaching, the 68-year-old historian asserted that the two were part of ""a continuing process."" ""My very great excitement has come in discovering just how much communicating with students means to me. The 'me' in me is wrapped up in my teaching,"" he stated. Professor Miner remarked that students now are more ""sophisticated"" than they were when he first came to Columbia in the '20's. ""I think that they demand more of the teaching staff, and that is a tribute to them. I think you have to make a much greater exertion to meet them at their best. ""For years I assumed that if you taught in Columbia College you were interested in the problems of Columbia College students,"" the white-haired historian commented. ""I'm disappointed to know that many students feel that there is a considerable gap between them and their teachers."" Professor Miner's interest in the problems of his students became apparent as he interrupted the interview to dispense helpful advice to the freshmen in his class about their CC final and told one student completing a late paper notto. pull two all-nighters in a row. ""Only work all night on alternate nights,"" he urged, ""Get some sleep in between."" Unlike many other tenured faculty members, Dr. Miner continues to teach freshman CC, remains a devoted advocate of the value of the College's required courses and believes in the importance of a general education. ""For so many students, these courses (CC and Humanities A) have opened up vistas they never would have known. Some institutions put you into a narrow path and make you specialize too early. If you make a mistake that's too bad. ""But these courses let students get excited unexpectedly about things they never would have studied otherwise. There's more to life than knowing more and more about less and less,"" he commented. In an animated fifteen minute performance, complete with facial descriptions of the participants and inspired mimicry of their voices, Dr. Miner recalled the heated faculty meeting in the 1930's during which Humanities A was created. ""I don't think that anywhere in the country there was a course like that in which freshmen were allowed to read books as books-not the textbooks which told you what the books said, but the great books themselves."" Columbia in the '30's, Dr. Miner recalled, was a center of political activity. John Jay Dining Room was a great center of meetings, and people used to come up from 14th Street to try and get control of the students and the resolutions committees."" ""In 1935 there was the great strike against war, where students pledged not to go to war. Of course they changed their minds when war broke out."" ""Columbia,"" the Moore Collegiate Professor noted, ""has always been a place which is sensitive to crises and to important challenges and it has responded to them rapidly."" Although he felt that Columbia had gone ihto a period of decline since World War 11, Professor Miner stated that he sensed ""a new vigor in the university since 1968,"" and he praised President McGill's leadership. Now, he feels he can end the story on the upbeat—""harrumph,"" as he put Miner stated his first goal upon retiring will be to complete his multivolume history of Columbia. After that, he said, he will ""turn to the writing I've always wanted to do but never got around to.""Dwight Miner"
239,"Seminar of September 27, 1973 Comments on Barzun Talk",14 November 1973,"Comments on Barzun TalkBy CARL HOVDEOne of the many good things about Prof. Barzun's paper is its concern that we address ourselves to these issues in an atmosphere without cant—without pieties, to use his word. There is always the risk, in the initial definition of a large enterprise, that we may come to love the sound of our own voices talking about ideals, more than we do the sound of students and teachers talking about particular problems. As the present—and most inexperienced—director of Humanities A in Columbia College, I can testify, I think accurately, that we carry on that enterprise with relatively little huffing and puffing about the general virtues of major works of literature. If a student asks, as the course begins, why he has to read a lot of stuff like that, most of us give him rather short shrift; perhaps the best answer is to say that he may find the works interesting once he has gotten into them. If, however, a student asks that question at the end of a semester, and has been doing the reading, it is a very serious situation indeed, and says something sombre about him, or me, or more likely about both of us. It was, I believe, Prof. Moses Hadas—long a star teacher in the course—who once suggested that Humanities A be listed in the College Bulletin simply as ""Books,"" and the upper-college Colloquium as ""More Books."" One understands just what he meant. One thing we should avoid—as Prof. Barzun avoided it—is any confusion between the terms ""general education,"" ""the liberal arts,"" and ""the humanities."" ""The humanities"" is the narrowest of the terms, since—in most common usage—it excludes the sciences, pure or applied, and is usually thought to be more or less applicable to a subject in the measure that it approaches the condition of, say, Homer's Iliad. The term ""liberal arts"" is wider, in part because it is sometimes, though not always, a short form for the ""liberal arts and sciences;"" it matters of course a good deal whether the word ""liberal"" modifies both terms, or just one of them. This phrase has had a long and varied career, as Prof. Barzun points out. It originally referred to the disciplines of theology, law, and medicine, and only later assumed the ""nonprofessional"" character which it now customarily has. As now most commonly used, the phrase refers to a rather shifting mix of subject matters, and attitudes towards them. That is, a student is in a ""liberal arts college"" when not in a technical school studying to be an automobile mechanic, or a hair-dresser; the implication is that such a student is probably reading history and literature, and perhaps sociology, and maybe even studying physics which, in a liberal arts college, is supposed to be available, in the fashion that compressed air is available at a filling-station. There is also the implication that a good deal of this student's work will have no immediate and clearly measureable effect on his ability to be gainfully employed in a certain job, other than the financial halo which lights up the head burdened with the bachelor's degree.The phrase general education"" on the other hand, is virtually without specific content, and refers rather to assumptions about the desirability of knowing more than one needs to know just to earn a living. There are a number of possible assumptions, of course. One is that it is simply better, because more interesting, to know more, rather than less; this is true, and is allthe more true for being so primitive an assertion. Mankind takes pleasure in knowledge—because of the nature of man, as Aristotle pointed out—though we all know that many resist it. There is also, associated with the phrase.the assumption that what one knows best, or works in—one's art that is to say—will be improved by familiarity with, and thought about, relationships between one's competence and the context within which it operates. This may or may not be true, of course, and to think that it is always true is sentimental. One remembers the attempts, now no longer carried on, to relieve the tedium of the industrial production line by explaining to the workers their place in the great chain of being which is the General Motors Corporation. The effect, probably just the opposite of what was intended, was to put on the last seal of boredom, like Charlie Chaplin's assembly-line job in Modern Times. But of course, the great difference between that kind of job and the professions studied at an institution such as this, is that the professional concern is, or should be, of immense interest in itself. Law, orengineering, or medicine, or journalism or business—these disciplines should and do provide great intellectual and emotional satisfaction to those in these professions, just as they presumably do to the teachers who profess the professions in the professional schools. These professions offer endless opportunities for the full engagement of intellect in important and complex problems because of the worlds with which they deal. It is of course for this reason that there should be, in the present context, real common work to be done between the professional schools and the Arts and Sciences departments, rather than an exchange of intellectual care packages. It comes down, of course, to the curriculum, and that comes down to particular people with their particular interests. Who can teach what responsibly, and who would be interested in studying with that person? Some guiding principles are necessary, no doubt; but the best we can hope for, I think, is the encouragement of an atmosphere at Columbia in which something we have been doing for quite a time, will be done by more people, and in more varied ways. In closing, let me admire Prof. Barzun's stress on rigor and responsibility in these matters. If there are to be any pieties, let them appear in the wake of performance. Carl Hovde is Chairman.

240,A Second Look at General Education,7 December 1973,"By DANIEL BELLWhen Dr. deßary wrote me this summer and said, ""Would you come and talk on general education,"" I accepted immediately, largely I suppose because I was seduced by the line which leaped to my mind as the introduction to my text: ""As I was saying before I was interrupted in 1968. There is a tendency today to think of 1968 as an extraordinary dividing line, much like Talleyrand who once said that only those who had lived before 1789 could have tasted of life in its sweetness and beauty. As with Talleyrand this is a great over-exaggeration. In fact, there is a problem in identifying so much of our difficulties with 1968. If one concentrated only on the events of 1968 it would be a grievous intellectualand sociological mistake. Our problems existed long before that time and the events of 1968 brought them to the surface. I welcome the chance to talk again about general education, a subject on which I spent a bit of time and which I'd abandoned; and to think through again some of the assumptions in the book I wrote eight years ago. I think it would be useful, particularly for a seminar which is reviewing the grounds of intellectual work to spend a bit of time on the historical background, particularly as it is one of my premises, that without a sense of history one doesn't know where one is at or why one is there. (There is an old remark in the Talmud which says, ""If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there."") In order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. J i j.: i a\If one thinks of general education (as distinct from liberal education, which has its sources far back in the origins of the universities of Abelard at Paris), general education really begins after World War I. There are three paradigms which account for the variations in the universities of the country. The oldest was at Columbia. It arose in 1920, under the impulse of people such as Frederick Woodbridge, the head of the Department of Philosophy, out of the need to overcome cultural fragmentation. The theme had already been struck in the pre-war report of Frederick Keppel, the Dean of Columbia College, that there was going to be a transformation of the colleges-because of the influx of the immigrants. At that time, it was the influx of the young Jews, mu«h as in the last decade we've had an influx of the blacks, and this was felt to be unsettling since the colleges would no longer just be educating the old stock of Americans. The theme of cultural fragmentation and cultural coherence became the major thread guiding early notions of Contemporary Civilization and the Humanities program at Columbia. This was a mundane reason; there was an intellectual reason. And, as in all these cases, the two usually combine. A second impulse came largely in Chicago in the 1940'5. The Hutch ins program was largely grounded in a philosophical notion of intellectual unification in and through the great ideas of the western world. This was paralleled at the time, although it wasn't Hutchins' program, with the idea of the ""unity of science."" This was a theme of the era. One sees this, for example, in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science which was begun by Charles Morris, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath at that particular time. The idea was that the time was ripe for some kind ofunity of science, unity of ideas, some notion which would allow education to have a forward rationale of its own. And this aspect became the impetus behind the Chicago program of the 40's and 50's. The third of the different impulses behind general education, was the Harvard Redbook of 1945 which instituted the general education program at Harvard. Essentially it was an emphasis on citizenship and the need, with the expansion of mass education, for a common ground of belief. The book accurately anticipated the fact that there would be a new mass education and argued for some conception of a common education. So in all these ways there was an effort at coherence—whether it be patriotic, sociological, intellectual—which was behind these diverse impulses for general education programs. If I turn now to the problem of what happened to these general education programs in the 50's, the major erosion factors, it seems to me, were essentially institutional. There were, as there are in these cases, intellectual elements; but the primary reasons were fundamentally institutional. These were: the rise of professionalism; the expansion of the graduate schools; the emphasis on disciplines; the introduction on the idea of training; apprenticeship to training (vocational in terms of even the best kinds of intellectual careers). And one had, then, the centrifugal elements introduced by these institutional pressures: the strengths of the departments against the college, the expansion of graduate education, and the emphasis on research —all of which pulled people away from general education and into these other areas. These pressures for the first time, are beginning now to relax, and I suppose this is one of the reasons why we are now able to begin to rethink our purposes. But one has to begin against the context of the past twenty years with its emphasis on professionalism, on graduate education and research as the major centrifugal tendencies in the University. My own effort, in my book on general education, was not an effort to rethink the whole of generaleducation. It was a more limited form of compromise. I do not belittle compromise where I think it is just; namely, I do not want to abandon a past, nor do I wholly assume that one can simply remake a future at will. One bends to the strengths of the time. Mine was an effort to deal with the realities of the situation within some new specification of a coherent framework. My own text at that time had three different emphases. One was the idea of using the disciplines themselves, since they had become strengthened for institutional and other reasons, as a foundation for general education. This would no longer aim at introductory surveys but, after an historical grounding, introduce a student to disciplines. Then, in a third tier or synoptic efforts, in which one would now assume certain competences, ask the student to apply those disciplines to broader social and intellectual questions. The second was an emphasis on conceptual inquiry as a methodological, but not a substantive, basis for the unity of general education. And the third was an emphasis on self-consciousness —historical self-consciousness, methodological self-consciousness and individual self-consciousness. And I tried to exemplify the various ways these three purposes could be achieved through a curriculum. There were three intellectual to those intentions. One was a triadic distinction in the modes of acquisition of knowledge: that the sciences were sequential, at least in their method of teaching, in which one had to have fairly orderly steps of advance, of what to know first in order to move ahead; that the social sciences were essentially based on linkages, in which the relationships between the economic, political and sociological orders had to be specified; and that the humanities were concentric, in the sense that there was a constant return to fundamental human concerns, the fundamental themes which human beings at all times and places have to existential concerns of death, tragedy,redemptive love, guilt, salvation —as these become exemplified in and through the great works of imagination. The second emphasis was not only the triadic distinction but an emphasis on conceptual renovation. Here there was a self-conscious effort to join a neoKantian view of knowledge as selective—that no single conceptual scheme can wholly exhaust a social reality, and it would be a mistake to try +o do so as many of the large schemes of the 19th century such as Marxism had tried —with the Deweyan argument on the need for reordering. I've always thought one of the most marvelous books I know is John Dewey's Art As Experience. It is one of the most lucid of Dewey's books. It emphasizes that the life of the imagination is a reordering of experience so as to allow one to see ideas, or art, in the many different lights one can. It was this emphasis on selectivity and reordering that I tried to join as the basis of the notion of conceptual inquiry. The third emphasis, which goes back to the heart of what has always been the Columbia tradition, particularly in the humanities, is a grounding in history as providing the major themes of the human dilemmas we've all had to face at one time or another. If one looks at what has happened education in the last decade or so the first ground of failure was the erosion of intellectual support, which was taking place at a rapid rate because of institutional pressures. This antedates 1968. The second problem was essentially cultural, and here one has the events of 1968 in large symbolic fashion. For, apart from the issue of the war, the student rebellion was acultural and political attack on authority, based on the notion that somehow authority itself could not justify itself. In effect, it sought to legitimate each person's search for his own experience as a measure of education, and no one therefore could challenge any individual's choice of what was happening to him as an invalid experience. This is a theme which Lionel Trilling has dealt with eloquently in his book Beyond Culture. What underlies the ""sincerity"" and ""authenticity"" of the theme is the notion that what was once the privilege of the artist—to be exempt from the codes and conventions of society—could now be claimed by everybody. We have here the idea of the ""democratization of genius."" For this reason we see a shift in which the emphasis was placed upon identity not education; upon one's own personal life exupon what things ""happened to me"" and what ""it did to me,"" rather than what is good or bad, and on what basis do I know. For this reason learning as self-exploration became a dominant theme. Along with this, there was a cultural attack on rationality and scientism—an emphasis on expressive as against cognitive modes. The argument, with some degree of justice, was that the cognitive mode had been overexaggerated, over-emphasized, and that not sufficient weight had been given to the expressive modes. There was a reaction, almost a huge onslaught, against all positivist modes of thought in the name of expressiveness as the desired way of understanding the world. The third problem for general education, independent of the others and perhaps more important in the next decade (though the cultural themes, now abated, have a longer underground life), is the failure of social science policy. No matter how much social science may try to justify or rationalize the fact that in the I%o's social science was not ""truly"" used, I think it is quite clear that, in the poverty programs, the education programs, the health programs, the welfare programs, etc., there was a simple inability to apply social science knowledge, as the society had applied technological knowledge, to its problems. So, if I look since the publication of my book to the elements which have further eroded general education it would be those three factors: the continuation, until now, of an emphasis on graduate education and research at the expense, institutionally and intellectually, of general education; the cultural attack on authority and the emphasis on personal experience at the expense of cultural tradition; and the inability to bring knowledge to bear on the solution of social problems, thus raising questions about the synoptic efforts to cross disciplines and make policy the focus of the integration of general education. Behind all this, however, may be an even larger problem; namely, a set of crises in the disciplines themselves. The first major efforts at general education—those from the 1930's through the based on some notion of intellectual orphilosophical unity of subjects or some common grounding in common subjects. The second, revisionist effort (among which I count my own), was an effort to focus on unity of method (conceptual renovation) and grounding in a discipline in order to bring that knowledge to bear on intellectual and social issues. But if application of knowledge has faltered, and the disciplines themselves are in trouble, then some entirely different intellectual approach may be in order. My sen .e of the crisis of the disciplines may be extreme; and my account of it will, necessarily, be highly schematic and even arbitrary. But I think it important to put these questions to the fore and make them the subject of debate. Ido not know enough about other field s—in the sciences, or humanities (though the discontent there seems rife). I shall speak only of the social sciences. If one looks at psychology one finds that the field which would have made the greatest claims and advances in recent years—that of cognitive psychology, with its notion of artificial intelligence or modelling of the mind, etc.—by and large has reached a blank wall; that personality theory lies wholly confused; social psychology has completely collapsed so that there is not even a definition of the field; and there has almost been the dissolution of Freudian theory as well. There is no coherent theory of human nature, though one has been promised for the last twenty-five years or so. The thin milk-and-water notions of someone like A. H. Maslow, of a hierarchy of experiences leading to self-actualization, simply do not suffice. What remains is the Old Testament vision, restated by William James of man as homo duplex, man seeking creativity and self-realization but also being a murderer to himself as well as to others. And without a coherent theory of human nature, or at least those aspects rooted in dynamic personality theory and in cognitive learning theory, we lack an organizing set of principles to move ahead in other areas of intellectual work. In anthropology there has been a complete collapse—this was evident even before the 60's—of the culture-personality theory, which had been the major effort to integrate holistic notions about culture with individual behaviour. We find that the key notion of anthropology—that of kinship itself—now lies, I won't say shattered, but in a disorderly array in which the older theories of Radcliffe-Browne, Fortes, or various other structural functionalists have been seriously challenged. We have a return, interestingly enough, to the study of myth and religion as one of the major new themes in anthropology; and this I would find fairly significant. The only new paradigm in anthropology —that of structuralism —by Levi-Strauss, out of Jakobson and Chomsky, is itself a paradox. It is an anti-intellectualist theory of mind in its emphasis not on the content in human experience but on the presumed underlying binary relationship of forms. In sociology, there has been a crumbling of functionalism, and a return either to vulgar Marxism or historicism, without any effort to rethink some of the older assumptions of both fields. In government, there has been, in a way, a collapse of behavioral political science and some fumbling efforts to return to normative theory. In history, there is on the one hand the narrowing of scope through the introduction of quantitative methods, which scares the older historians, and on the other hand, a radical over-politicization of history by the new revisionists. One could argue, I suppose, that history has always had an ideological function, but I think it's quite startling to see the in-credible over-politicization of history by the new revisionists. In philosophy, I think one would say, there has been a retreat in the philosophy of science—which has been particularly strong at Columbiana retreat from logical analysis to history, as a way of understanding the character of science. There has been a turning away from linguistic philosophy and a return to moral questions as a new center, with people like Hampshire, Rawls, and others moving in that direction. Economics, which in some ways is still the most elegant of all paradigms in the social sciences, increasingly is seen as a very narrow, self-contained field in which the key problems are largely outside the understanding or even the interest of most economists. At every crucial point, when one looks at an econometric model and raises issues about political choice, or values, or social questions, the economist will say, ""Well, those are exogenous variables and outside my field. I have to work with what is given. I can only deal with endogenous variables and beautifully manipulate in my mathematical models these endogenous variables."" Besides the circumscribed nature of neo-classical theory there is a confusion in welfare economics, which has been the rising field in"
241,"Comments on Trilling Talk of October 25,1973",7 December 1973,"By MATTHEW SANTIROCCOBy EDWARD W. SAIDBy JOSEPH MAZZEOThe need for continuity between secondary and higher education has been emphasized by the three preceding speakers. It is interesting that they come from the English Department. For their subject, continuity is largely a matter of quality, scope, and level of instruction since all students in secondary schools have at least some experience with English language and literature before college. Yet there are other subjects where the need for continuity is dramatized further by its very absence. Perhaps, then, I may be permitted to refer to my own subject to make two points. Far fewer students now study the classics in college. The difficulty of the languages is,proposed as a reason, one feels, only by classicists nostalgic for the good old days when —to adapt Homer—one man alone could conjugate a verb which ten men of our decadent day cannot. Another reason often suggested is poor teaching. Nicholas Murray Butler, for instance, tells us himself how his classical education was stifled under instructors such as the Columbia lexicographer, Charles Short. Can anyone wonder why, after reading the title of Butler's only contribution to the field, ""The Post-positive £Y in Proper - tius?"" But the classics have no monopoly on poor teachers and one Moses Hadas makes up for many Short-comings. The decline in college classics is due in part to the mundane fact that these languages are no longer regularly taught in the secondary schools. There used to be great continuity, though. It is no coincidence that the preparatory school in New York City which still bears the University's name was founded by the editor of Horace, Professor Anthon. And for years our Professor Drisler edited the Harper's classical series for the use of schools as well as colleges. This continuity has broken down. The reason is obvious. The classics used to be a practical study; they used to function as rites de passage. They simply do not any longer. We cannot go back to the time when Greek and Latin were required for entrance into both university and society. No one, it istrue, wants a captive audience. But if Greek and Latin were more widely and imaginatively taught as electives in the secondary schools more people would study them in college. I have discussed this matter at some length to make two points which, I hope, complement what Prof. Trilling has said. One is that continuity is not just a matter of quality, scope, and level of instruction but also of the availability of instruction itself. The other is that not only classicists but the entire academic community can no longer afford to ignore secondary education; this concern is no longer an option but an obligation. So far, the need for continuity. Now to the methods of realizing that goal. Prof. Trilling has used the words ""secondary"" and ""preparatory"" as synonyms, for he is considering those schools which, at least theoretically, prepare the student to go on to college. He also used the word ""system,"" however, and the largest system is public—a system which is preparatory in no sense of the word and secondary in every sense of that word. This raises serious questions. The easiest method of achieving a modicum of continuity might at first seem to be to make distinctions between institutions or programs that are college preparatory and those that are terminal. But such a distinction, in a public system at least, will seem elitist to many, and not just to Americans. Even in Europe, secondary students are now screened at a much later age: over the years in Germany this has risen from 7 to 12, in England the 11-plus examination system is being phased out, and in both countries the Gesamtschule and comprehensive schools have come into their own. If continuity between secondary and higher education is to be achieved in America it must take these social and political considerations into account. Nor is it only the high schools' egalitarian rationale that may seem threatened by facile, methodologies. It has been shrewdly observed by Prof. Trilling that the colleges now perform tasks which are really in thedomain of the high schools. Open admissions and remedial programs may suggest themselves in this context. But would returning these functions back to the schools where, admittedly, they belong seem to threaten the democratization of higher education? From the need and then the methods we can move, finally, to the possibility of continuity. It has been noted by Prof. Trilling that American secondary education is distinguished from the European fycee, Gymnasium, or public-grammar schools by its almost complete lack of continuity with higher education. This distinction between the two systems, however, is not the only one that can be made. British students, for instance, spend the last few years before university in preparing for A-levels, examinations in advanced courses. It is possible to gain admission to an Oxbridge college with very few A-levels, and once at Oxford or Cambridge the student pursues one of these subjects exclusively. Not only is this inadequate for the development of the whole man, but it may also be bad for that professionalism which it is, presumably, designed to serve in that it develops one-sided scholars. If, then, secondary and higher education * are reciprocal in Europe, this is because of muchearlier specialization. Continuity, at least along these lines, is at the expense of general education. So the ultimate question Prof. Trilling's remarks provoke must be: is continuity possible and, if so, how can it be achieved between the two different levels of American schooling without sacrificing our liberal arts goals since, by itself, it cannot ensure them. Prof. Trilling is, to date, the only speaker at the General Education Seminars to relate college education to what goes before it. This has suggested three lines of inquiry: the extent of the need for continuity, the social implications of our methodologies, and the possibility of continuity within a general education framework. Prof. Carolyn Heilbrun observed here a few weeks ago that the value of the humanities lies not so much in the answers they offer as in the questions they pose. It is, then, on these many questions that this discussion of Prof. Trilling's very valuable remarks can end —or, more properly speaking, begin. Matthew Santirocco is a Graduate Student in the Department of Greek and Latin.Prof. Trilling's survey of the history of positions taken on liberal education at Columbia emphasizes the general neglect of the propaedeutic role of secondary education in this history and controversy. Having myself a strongly vested interest in propaedeutics in general and the notion of beginnings in particular, I should like to consider this question a little further, perhaps to alter or to attempt to alter Professor Trilling's implied thesis that the relation between secondary and university education today is essentially a dynastic one; that is, that secondary education is the A from which B, or university education, follows. There is no question that, as Professor Trilling has said, this has often been the case. In the nonAmerican cultures he mentions and in the one in which I grew up—also a non-American one —it has generally been assumed that a classical education preceded, both in time and because of time, the university phase of learning. In the case that I know something about, there has been felt in the twentieth century a mmore aggravated sense of discontinuity between the classical propaedeutic and the university curricula. The reason has been and still is that the classical culture in question is not only more or less ancient but, more important, that it is technically inadequate as a preparation for the exigencies of modern knowledge, which, it must be added, is conceived of as essentially foreign, and in many cases, Western. What Prof. Trilling did not say, although I assume that he might have assumed it, is that in these considerations (here at Columbia and elsewhere) on general education in the humanities the role of secondary education receives little attention not because this role is outside the debate but, quite the contrary, that it is supposed as being included within the debate. That is, there may be a sort of aostility felt in general between university and school theoreticians (maybe there is only the very slightest hostility), but it is felt that the earlier education is a support for, and included in, the later. Thus I recall that when it was discovered by the better schools some years ago that courses like Humanities A were required of freshmen in the better universities the response was to start having school students read translations of the Iliad and Alcestis. I believe that the embrace by the secondary school of the university attitude to general education in the humanities is a very important development. It was made possible in many, but not all, ways simply by the almost incredible diffusion of translations, by which literally, or almost literally, everything becomes more or less instantly available. This is not only a sociological fact but also an intellectual and imaginative one, for it has radically altered the at-titudes students, and by extension their teachers, have towards language and towards the text. In the classical system of education there was first posited an important intellectual resistance to the student's mind, namely the classical language and the classical text. This resistance was to be slowly overcome by language study, by the production of texts in that language, and thereafter the systematic study of classical texts in the language. Now, however, that resistance is, if not gone completely, then displaced, or perhaps re-distributed. Because the culturally precocious student, as Prof. Trilling has characterized him, has available to him all texts in all languages in his language —and this is obviously even more true of the university student —then knowledge in the humanities is thought of more as exposure and absorption than it is as systematic ground-breaking and systematically-acquired discipline. Among teacher:; of literature, for instance, the main problem facing us as we think about the curriculum is the problem of cumulative progress, or of systematic structure and serial order —which course should come first, which second and so on. Along with this problem is an extraordinarily felt need among students for courses in methods, methodology, and structure. Another way of seeing the effect of translations is to note, historically speaking, that in the humanities, according to Erich Auerbach and Leo Spitzer, the propaedeutic pattern followed is philology; now, however, the propaedeutic pattern followed is probably closer to a rationalist, democratic, universaust linguistics of some sort. Probably the trend from one to the other began in the mid-eighteenth century when, with the daring philological speculations of such men as Vico, Herder, and Rousseau, traditional philological science was felt to be an impediment to knowledge of the human essence. As Vico said in describing his auto-didactic method in tne New Science, ""For purposes of this enquiry we must reckon as if there were no books in the world."" You can see that such an attitude to the book, as a resistance, or as something to be circumvented for the information it contains, will very strongly modify one's idea of what a text is, and indeed of what a language is. When Nietzche was to say that ""there is hygiene of life near the volumes of science"" and that the essence of this hygiene was the unhistorical and the superhistorical, both of which counteracted the malady of history, he was merely pressing further Vico's point that the conceit of the philologists obscures ""ideal eternal history."" It is ironic that the effect of the Vichian'and the Nietzschean anti-philology was far more drastic than both men, highly trained philologists themselves, had perhaps intended. I spoke earlier of a dynastic relation assumed between secondary and university education. My view, as I have implied, is that this relation is abrogated now;just as there are very few students being trained presently ""to find etymologies"" as the great philologists put it, so too the relation between secondary school and university is not etymological. One's sense is of a trans-ethnic, trans-cultural, and even trans-textual relation imposed upon the two. It is this relation that gives all of us the heady feeling that all knowledge is available, if one has the time of course; and the not-so-heady feeling that all knowledge, in the humanities at least, is equal and ultimately monochromatic. My own feeling is that the current predicament concerns units of knowledge: definingthem, aligning them, relating them. That this is a predicament is indicated, I think, by the air of lost abstraction that sometimes hangs over enterprises like even the one we are engaged in here. This accentuates the institutionalization of knowledge in orders and levels that defy pictorial, temporal, or spatial apprehension. At a university, for example, one feels that knowledge is all around, as in a library; but what is elusive is the verbal, textual, and rhetorical center that we assumed had once systematically enlivened the books. I hope it will be understood that I am not simply saying that the problem of the humanities in secondary schools and in the university is that languages like Latin and Greek are no longer taught as centrally as once they were. Nor am I saying only that tran-"
242,Comments on Breslow Talk,30 January 1974,"By GEORGE FLYNNBy JULIAN M. MILLERProfessor Breslow has given a complete description of a general education program in the sciences for specialists. The specialists are largely premedical, engineering, and science major students. Such a program should be distinguished from a specialized training for specialists. For example, none of the courses discusses specifically the chemistry of ""current medical drugs,"" a topiewhich would presumably be of direct interest to premedical students. The philosophy here is simply that truly educational courses, even in the sciences, should attempt as much as possible to teach material which is largely ""timeless,"" consistent with rapid changes and advancement in scientific areas. I would like to focus on a different aspect of science education for a few moments. The Columbia College Committee on Instruction has been considering the philosophy of, and the approach to be taken in, general science education for non-specialists. My remarks in no way represent the official thinking or position of that Committee but only my own views. There seem to be two overall aspects of general science education for non-specialists. The first is ""non-practical"" intellectual broadening—an exposure to the techniques, methods, and discipline of scientific thought (""non-practical"" should not be construed as useless). The second is the practical aspect. How do you (or do you?) inject the average nonspecialist into society prepared to deal with the scientific/technological realities of the modern world? Should a general science education enable the average citizen to make enlightened ecological and technological decisions? This is clearly a life and death question for modern man. In terms of specific current issues, should we educate the non-specialist well enough to decide: a) to vote for/against nuclear power plants b) to vote for/against SST c) to buy/not buy a microwave oven or a color TV set. Peter Pouncey has used the concept of a bond issue to characterize the practical aspects of science education. If all the scientific/technological decisions of the modern age were reduced to bond issues, should everyone be educated well enough to vote intelligently on the alternatives? (The words are those of the author.) Although I have spent more time describing the practical aspects of science education than the non-practical, my own view is that education of a practical nature as I have described it is probably impossible and —at the very least —an unwise indulgence for a truly educational program. Let me return to the first aspect and ask what science offers in a ""non-practical"" way to general education that makes scientific education worthwhile. There are at least three features which seem to me to be worth considering: 1) Exposure to a logical, deductive, and rigorous reasoning process. 2) Exposure to experimental verification or testing of current wisdoms. 3) Exposure to a discipline where there are large areas of knowledge considered by all practitioners to be hard, objective fact. Science certainly has no monopoly on item l.'Such a feature is shared by mathematics, philosophy, theology, and other intellectual endeavors. Item 2 is a core feature, for experimental tests are the gods (or golden calves?) of scientific progress and thought. The presence of hard, objective truth in science is, of course, not something which appears instantaneously with new ideas. Many arguments and years usually pass before a ""truth"" enters the body of knowledgeconsidered hard tact. It is my own personal view that the three features above, particularly when integrated, form the basis of an extremely worthwhile educational experience. Let me turn, in closing, to the practical aspects of science education about which I am pessimistic. I would like to read you a citation for the American Chemical Society Award for Pollution Control which appeared in Chemical and Engineering News, November 26, 1973, page 30. I will then give three interpretations of this citation based on three levels of scientific/technological education. The citation follows: ""Nitrogen oxide exhaust from supersonic aircraft threatens grave damage to the earth, says Harold S. Johnston, professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Johnston has pinned down in precise and documented form exactly what is meant by this statement. The ozone shield in the atmosphere absorbs much of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. With a modest reduction of thisshield, tissue damage to life on earth would be severe. With a large reduction of this field, many forms of life could no longer exist. ""Through his technique of molecular modulation spectroscopy, Dr. Johnston has demonstrated that the ozone layer is very vulnerable to increases in nitrogen oxide concentrations. His calculations have shown that the distribution of nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere is as important as the quantity in determining the amount of ozone reduction. ""By releasing nitrogen oxides, SST aircraft would cause catalytic destruction of the ozone. Dr. Johnston's pioneering studies are expected to have an increasing impact as other scientists follow his lead and exploit his methods."" The first interpretation of these remarks might be that of someone totally isolated from current affairsand scientific/technological problems —someone coming out of the jungle after 10 years of isolation. Presumably, the response of such a person would be total lack of understanding as well as complete lack of comprehension of even the language used in the citation. The second interpretation might be that of my general chemistry students after my lecture of this morning on the timely topic of chemical kinetics. I think a majority of them would feel that Prof. Johnston has clearly shown that building large numbers of SST's will lead to the destruction of life on earth. The third interpretation is that of experts in the field of gas phase chemical kinetics. A not unreasonable view of this group would be that Johnston is very good; he has done some experiments which are probably correct; the data warrants caution; but we are hardly convinced that his analysis is complete. (In a telephone conversation after the seminar one member of this ""group"" told me bluntly that Johnston has sold the Congress a bogus bag of goods.) I hope that this example illustrates both the difficulty and danger of attempting to educate nonspecialists ""well enough"" to solve practical questions of a scientific/technological nature. Most of the science/technology decisions made in our society today have more than a small share of both political and sociological impact. In addition, the scientific ""facts"" are often less than ""perfectly clear."" In view of these problems a practical orientation for a general science course for non-specialists seems, to me at least, to be unwise. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly support the concept of education in the science areas for nonspecialists. The aims of such education, though, should be less to train and more t0... EDUCATE! George Flynn is Associate Professor of Chemistry, Columbia UniversityAny consideration of the interaction between science and general education immediately brings to mind that there are two classes of students who present rather different problems: there are those who major in science and there are those who do not. The ladder-like structure of courses in science in which each course depends critically on those preceding it has required that undergraduate students from Columbia College who are majoring in one of the sciences spread the general education requirement over the whole four years rather than completing it during the first two. This has, in the past, created considerable adverse comment from many quarters in the College. I would suggest, however, that the spreading of the general education requirement over the whole four years is a distinct advantage. It seems to me that, when a student can bring to the consideration of some of the masterpieces of philosophy, literature, social .science, and art, a deep understanding of how one branch of intellectual endeavor —science —attempts to deal with problems, this is a distinct advantage. I regret that the students of science in Columbia at this time get so little, if any, exposure to either the history of science or the philosophy of science. I think that these courses would be particularly valuable for them as it is instructive, enjoyable, and fruitful, to talk about science after you know some science. By the same token, I do not believe that courses in either the philosophy of science or the history of science can adequately provide for the needs of the nonscience major. With this category of student I believe the aim should be to achieve at least a minimal scientific literacy. I think that this can only be done by acourse in science itself. Just as in the social sciences and humanities a general education is imparted largely through the exposure of the student to masterpieces in the subject, so literacy in science can also be engendered by exposure to the masterpieces of science. After all, our present picture of the physical universe is a direct consequence of these masterpieces. Just as one should not study Shakespeare by reading a Readers Digest synopsis for plot, or learn a language but be excused from being able to conjugate the verbs, so in science one must do the science and become immersed in it. A good chemistry course on the undergraduate level is not merely a presentation of the present facts and theories concerning the subject. Rather, it necessarily entails presentation of how the subject evolved and why it is that at the present time the picture that we have of the physical universe is the only one that we can have. It seems to me that when the teaching of science is approached from this point of view, then it is a liberalizing experience and is an essential part of the educated man's background. It is because of this that I am dubious that a course in general science—usually a combination of astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics—can adequately serve the purposes of general education. I believe that such a course, unlike a good course in one of the sciences, can rapidly degenerate into a presentation of the present facts and theories of the subject in what is hopefully a romantic and exciting fashion. Romantic and exciting though it may become, I do not believe it serves adequately for the needs of the non-science major. Julian Miller is Professor of Chemistry, Columbia University"
243,Humanities Texts To Be Dramatized As Teaching Aid,8 February 1974,"By ALLEN WEINGARTENIn an attempt to enhance the College's Humanities course, theatrical productions coinciding with the course's literary texts may be presented next fall, Professor of English Carl F. Hovde, chairman of the humanities department, announced yesterday. A proposal, prepared jointly by Dean of the School of the Arts Bernard Beckerman and Professor Hovde, for establishing such productions has been submitted to the National Endowment for the Humanities to obtain funding, Dr. Hovde revealed. Professor Hovde noted that the productions would be professional in both directing and acting. ""Professor Beckerman would direct it himself or find those capable of doing it. We're talking about professional actors, actors who can do a scene in two or three different ways. That takes a real professional, not student actors,"" he stated. Rather than presenting entire plays, the program ""would involve the use of single illustrative scenes done in a certain way to examine the various interpretations,"" the professor stated. In this way, the productions would ""Portray through actordramatic presentation the implication of what is the truth —that these things are intended for performance,"" he explained. The former College Dean noted that the program would ""not be going on all year ... there would be a six week or two month period within which it would be done."" ""Students would have already read the play and discussed it in class ... It would involve the students actively, not as actors,but to examine how the scene is conceived,"" he said. Professor of English and Dean of the Summer Session Frederick Keener, who coordinated the drafting of the proposal, was optimistic about the possibility of getting funds for the program, because ""we did get the planning right."" Agreeing with Professor Hovde, he noted, ""There is no doubt that the way something is staged and performed affects its meaning and again brings out meaning that otherwise would not be noticed. It is different seeing a scene performed than if you are just reading it in a hurry."" In an interview earlier this week, Dean Beckerman confirmed that he had cooperated intensively with Professor Hovde in preparing the proposal. Noting that ""our own people in the arts will be involved in it,"" the dean cautioned that at present he is ""waiting to see what the response will be"" from the National Endowment for the Humanities which will consider the proposal as part of the Program for General and Continuing Education in the Humanities. Professor Hovde pointed out, as a reason for the proposal, that ""Humanities A has, especially in the first semester, a number of dramatists: Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, and Aristophanes.OFF THE TUITION!: Chris Puca of the Attica Brigade harangues a crowd of 100 at the Sundial yesterday, protesting President McGill's proposal to institute a sweeping across-the-board $220 tuition increase."
244,Marcus to Head Committee Planning Humanities Center,14 February 1974,"By LOU De STEFANOProfessor of English Steven Marcus will head a committee planning the establishment of a national center for the humanities. Marcus said yesterday that the purpose of the proposed center is ""to found for the humanities a kind of analogue for the two great centers which exist for the natural sciences at Princeton and for behaviorism at Stanford."" In addition to overseeing the planning for the center, he will also be in charge of raising funds for it. At the completion of the planning stage, a project report outlining the center will be issued by the committee. Describing the likely operation of the center, Marcus said it will bring together a group of scholarswho will ""talk together, work together, and socialize together."" He stressed that the national center ""is not part of the de Bary plan"" for continuing and general education, though he noted ""we are both interested in General. Education."" Stating that the location of the center has yet to be decided, he said, ""One of our problems would be to find a site for it."" Marcus also said he is not sure how long he will remain in his post as committee chairman, commenting, ""I've taken this job on for a period of eight months, and if I do like it, I'll go on for another year."" However, he disclaimed any interest in directing the center once it is established."
245,Religious Studies and General Education at Columbia,17 April 1974,"By PAUL R. VALLIEREAt the risk of making too enthusiastic a proposition right from the start, I would like to suggest that in the relations between religious studies and the General Education Program at Columbia, we have the makings of a real bond of affection. For reasons which I shall go into momentarily, it seems to me that religious studies fits very naturally into the General Education Program and, in fact, that such a context is a healthier one for the study of religion than many conceivable alternatives, including the domination of the curricular structure by departmental majors' programs. At the same time, it is generally recognized that, in most relations of an affective sort, there is a danger that passion will make out our vices to be our virtues, thereby allowing us to go on doing badly what we have been doing badly, but with the feeling that it is done well after all. Clearly, the fonder religious studies and general education grow of one another, the more they need to consider the legitimacy of their offspring. So it is both enthusiasm and a sense of propriety that I am responsible for communicating today. I. The basis of the contention that religious studies rather naturally finds a place in the GeneralEducation Program lies in an examination of at least three of the basic commitments which have been attributed to the General Education Program at one time or another in our Thursday seminar. First, general education has been said to involve a commitment to interdisciplinary education. Second, general education has been charged with the commitment to examine general questions of value as they arise in teaching and scholarship. And, finally, at least one major speaker in this seminar, Daniel Bell, has suggested that a general education program should be committed to coming to grips with ""the search for new sacred meanings"" which is going on in our culture, as evidenced by the proliferation of new religious cults of all sorts. I would argue that all three of these commitments also characterize the field of religion; hence, the potential enthusiasm of the field for the project of general education. I would also argue, however, that the experience of the field of religion in wrestling with these commitments does not lead us to believe that they are easily fulfilled or that they are going to be bonanzas for the professional interested in problemsolving. Let us begin with the interdisciplinary impulse of general education. The field of religious studiesresponds to this because it is already interdisciplinary in practice. For one thing, a good deal of the study of religion which now goes on at Columbia or at any other university takes place outside the Department of Religion: in departments of history, sociology, anthropology, and others. But even the Department of Religion itself is essentially interdisciplinary; it is held together not by a common method of study but by a common subject matter which has to be investigated in a variety of ways. This can be grasped most clearly if one looks at the historical roots of modern religious studies. They are quite diverse. One of the main lines of descent is the study of theology and Western religious philosophy, which grew up mainly in educational institutions with Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish roots —educational institutions in which the theological schools of the three religious groups played the key role. A second main line is the study of bodies of classical religious literature, originally a philological enterprise which later expanded into cultural and intellectual history. The secular university was a key institution in this field, but theological schools also contributed, expecially to the study of the Hebrew and Greek scriptures. Finally, there is the social scientific study of religion developed by the founding fathers of modern anthropology and sociology, such as Weber and Durkheim. This line of descent falls wholly within the traditions of secular scholarship. Each of these areas of study is still fundamental to the field of religion. Consequently, the field is going to remain interdisciplinary from within. Now, at just this point, the problem of turning vices into virtues finds its first illustration. The interdisciplinary character of the field of religion, for all the exhilarating possibilities it offers, also is the chief source of the protracted state of confusion in the ranks of scholars and teachers over the general objectives of the field of study and the methods by which they are to be attained. While the point should not be overstated, since scholars of religion do enjoy their business by and large, it certainly is not wrong to argue, on the basis of our experience, that in-terdisciplinary projects are as likely to produce chaos as Utopia. Peter Gay's warnings to us last week in this regard have considerable application in the field of religion. The point at which we might part company with Prof. Gay lies in his confidence that interdisciplinary activity is best pursued from, in his words, ""within the shelter of the discipline itself."" The field of religion is not really a shelter vis-a-vis the pressures of interdisciplinary practice. It is rather a place of severest exposure. For this reason, the field of religon turns to a general education program not only to make a contribution, but to seek guidance from colleagues throughout the University. The same sort of opportunity and the same sort of problem for the field of religion lie in a second commitment of general education: the examination of questions of value in teaching and scholarship. Here, too, religious studies finds it attractive to participate, since its subject matter above all consists of the enduring classical systems of value which are the religions of the world, and of the experiential matrices, such as tragedy, sanctity, and destiny, out of which these systems arise. Discussion of values is the stock-in-trade of the field. But again, it is just when the match looks good that the problems also arise. While reflection upon the ultimate values of human life probably is the final end of religious studies, a number of difficulties attend the process of attainment, andthese are difficulties which every general education program sooner or later has to face, too. One of the difficulties is the tendency of value-discovery sessions oriented to personal consciousness to end by subjectivizing and trivializing values. The weakness of much so-called education in values is not only that it proceeds by improper methods but that it does not really get to the logic of values at all. It remains subjectively oriented, while the thrust of religious values certainly, and perhaps of other values as well, is in theopposite direction: tending to be ontological rather than phenomenological, universalist rather than relativist. But, on the other hand, when one attempts to maintain an ontological or universalist orientation in teaching about values, the difficult question arises as to whether words such as ""ontological"" and ""universalist"" have any concrete meaning in relation to values in our time. In the field of religion in particular, where the commitment to cross-cultural study is quite firm, more detailed and sophisticated knowledge of the subject matter often seems to go hand-in-hand with an increasing sense of the relativity of values, even though after a certain point this sense of relativity again makes it most difficult really to grasp, or sympathetically to penetrate, systems of religious values. It is very hard to break out of this circle; yet, a project of general education probably requires that we break out of it to some extent, if only to agree on a common set of questions and problems to discuss. Attempts at such a working consensus necessarily have a certain artificiality about them. The question is whether there is any way around this. A third commitment of general education, if we would follow Daniel Bell, is the responsibility for coming to terms with ""efforts being made to find new sacred meanings for the life of the individual and for society as a whole.""This task extends the examination of values in education into the religious area itself. Discussion is made difficult here by the fact that Bell's remarks probably would not elicit a consensus among us to begin with and because Bell leaves the matter of .""new sacred meanings"" almost as soon as he raises it his speech. In interpreting his remarks, then, one runs the risk of assigning a meaning to his words which he might not accept. Nevertheless, Bell does seem to be suggesting that general education has some formative role to play in the religious evolution of contemporary culture and that religious concerns of our culture may contribute to shaping general education.These are suggestions which scholars of religion have given some thought to before; and, since they have to do with our field of study, it should occasion no surprise that we are eager to discuss them. But, once again, we also would have to point to the difficulty of handling the discussion which is being proposed.If one were to ask, starkly, ""Does the very possibility of a coherent general education program depend to some extent upon making a connection with an awareness of 'new sacred meanings for the life of the individual and for society as a whole?,' "" would Bell answer, ""Yes.""? And if so, are not the immensity and even the presumptuousness of the proposal there for all to see? Scholars of religion will be as quick as other humanists to see the pitfalls. For one thing, our studies of religion and culture lead us to believe that ""new sacred meanings"" are rarely worked out by university committees or financed by foundation funds.The experience of the field of religion may suggest that, in dealing with ""sacred meanings"" in general education, one must not back away altogether from the challenge which Prof. Bell is posing, but must respond to it in terms of the specific resources and the specific limitations of the University context. One practical way of doing this, for example, might be for scholars involved in general education to make a disciplined investigation of the religious problems and the religious values which arise within the tradition of"
246,Oxford's post-grad biographies,18 May 1977,"By GEORGE STEVENSONEliot's Early Years, by Lyndall Gordon, Oxford, 174 pp., A FEAST OF WORDS: The Triumph of Edith Wharton, by Cynthia Griffin Wolff, Oxford, 453pp., $15.95. Worried that after four years, Humanities 'A,' and a Comp Lit major that your post-college reading list will tend more to William Goldman than Wm. Faulkner? That your Penguin Classics will be the onlv classicson the shelf? Whether or not your library will be chosen by color rather than content? Have no fear: the Oxford series of critical biographies, besides being critically and literarily sound, is also bound in very attractive, if more or less somber and dignified, colors. Long a bastion of the so-called ""scholarly"" book, the Oxford Press, based in Oxford (of course) and New York, also prints a good number of books for the nonliterati, and books that are ""borderline"" critical biographies, neither comprehensive enough nor complex enough for the scholar, but interesting enough for the English major who went to business school and misses the good old days when his major worries centered around Main Street rather than Wall Street. Unfortunately, at times the books require more than one might expect at first glance, caveat emptor and caveat reader both are in order. Eliot's Early Years, by a former Columbia instructor, Lyndall Gordon, (the acknowledgements include Jacques Barzun and Quentin Anderson) is a case in point; it is literate, readable andmore or less biographical, but it also is only comprehensible if one has a very fair knowledge of the greater portion of Eliot's early (i.e. pre-conversion to Christianity) work. It is meticulously end-noted,something I found a minor, but persistent, irritiation: illiterates such as myself tend to glance at the bottom of the page when we see the little numbers. The list of biographical sources, though, is a good guide to other works of interest, some of them a little less arcane to the newly initiated. The method Gordon uses in dealing with the frighteningly fascinating development of the poet gives almost no weight at all to his actual childhood, but concentrates on his ancestry and the tastes and biases of his parents, all in a very literary way. The little boy who became T.S. Eliot is never seen; the young man who became the poet, however, is carefully presented at the moments of crisis and of epiphany, usually through the verse that resulted. His conversion to Christianity, too, is given careful treatment, and in much the same way. It is very good and very concise but, as I saidbefore, it is not for the tyro. Cynthia Griffin Wolff's A Feast of Words, about Edith Wharton, is in a similar vein—tracing the life through the works. And although the preface would have us believe otherwise, there is more of the life here than in the Eliot volume.Telling us outright that ""our concern is ultimately the fictions, not the life ..."" she still provides a more frankly biographical account of the deb that won the Pulitzer. Also included in the work areseveral examples of Wharton's heretofore unpublished works and an appendix concerning a work never completed, though ghoulishly planned in erotic detail. A Feast of Words, too, falls victim to endnote's disease, it is a far morefar more accessible book, both as biography and as criticism; though this is due, I think, to Wharton being a far more accessible writer. Wolff takes a slightly feminist stance with the work, but does so in a fashion that is readily supa readily supportable fashion. The book opens with as compelling an observation as one couldwish and goes from there: when a book can begin with ""It is a strange fact that while many men begin their novel-writing careers with fictional accounts of their apprenticeship, until recently most women who became novelists have never written fictional accounts of their apprenticeship at all . . ."""
247,VP's option study sees cut in Ph.D's Report by Young cites challenges for university in the next decade,27 May 1977,"Report by Young cites challenges for university in the next decadeBy DANIEL JANISONColumbia will graduate fewer doctoral students and more undergraduates, and will become an institution less immersed in the liberal arts if a major planning document released last week is followed In a 30-page paper on the future of the arts and sciences at Columbia, James Young, vice-president for academic planning and deputy provost, describes the options available if the university is to be financially secure in a decade, and able to hold the academic standards it has set for iiself, and still serve a rapidly changing population. ' ■ ""The arts and sciences are thus facing a triple challenge in, the nineteen-eighties,"" begins the study, and the result is a university ' with apparent cutbacks in the humanities, a smaller faculty and a larger undergraduate body. Young describes the neccesity of ""a more selectivestructure of specialization, in Ph.D programs; improved utilization of faculty resources, through such methods as planned enrollment expansion, (and) expanded educational opportunity, including but not limited to improved educational opportunity for women."" He said in an interview yesterday that the first item would include cutting the size of the arts and sciences graduate student body from its present approximated enrollment of 5,000 to the size of the College, which has about 2,700 students. He described the report as a ""think piece"" designed to set a ""value-system"" which would pave the way for specific, nuts-and-bolts budget proposals to be worked out by the Deans Planning Group, a committee of graduate deans currently preparing its own study. Thatstudy is expected to be more specific in its recommendations, in the context of more concrete budgetary considerations. Although Dean of the Business School Boris Yavitz, who heads the planning group, could not be reached for comment, the report has been tentatively scheduled to come out in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, William R. Shepard Professor of History Eugene Rice, who heads the 14member Arts and Sciences Policy Advisory Committee, which is preparing recommendations of its own, said his committee expects to submit its recommendations to arts and sciences deans today. Commenting on his study, the product of his last year in the Columbia administration Young said ""the last (structural) status quo is un-preservable. I don't care if it's Barnard, or Arts and Sciences. The times are changing it willy nilly, While the report provides for separate, distinct undergraduate institutions — including Barnard — Young refused to say how this, and his suggestion of separate institutions would be combined.Photo by Matthew Pimm IVY HONORS: Standing behind plastic ivy tied to the podium on the steps of Low is Helen Suxman a member of the South African parliament and an ardent opponent of apartheid.

249,HUD grants CU $5 million loan for East Campus dorm complex,4 October 1978,"By KEN WILLSColumbia has been granted a $5 million loan from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to help finance the East Campus dormitory, it was announced yesterday. The HUD loan is a substantial portion of the projected $17 million complex and may encourage alumni and friends of the university to help finance the development, according to Joseph Mansfield, director of development for capital campaigns and major grants. In addition, $8 million in New York State Dormitory Authority bonds were issued over the last several days in July, according to University Treasurer William Bloor. Mansfield, who is in charge of fund raising for the East Campusdevelopment, said $8 million had, been promised from private sources so far but the goal is to raise an additional $12 million. ""The faster we raise total dollars the less we'll have to pay in interest"" on the loan, he said. Mansfield called the loan a ""positive factor"" that 'Enables us to get to get going immediately. Demolition of buildings along Morningside Drive between 117 th and 118 th Streets, where the complex will be located, began Monday. The university has launched a fund-raising campaign blitz called the ""Campaign to Assure the Quality of Life."" Besides the Board of Visitors, a staff of 40 is working under Mansfield to raise the additional $12 million. The university is also showing an eight minute film on Columbia'shousing plight to encourage pledges. Money raised over the $20 million goal would be used for the ""second stage"" of the campaign which, according to a promotion pamphlet, is the renovation of South Campus dorms-—Livingston, Hartley, Furnald and John Jay. ""Without the final plans for the South Campus dorms, it's hard to ask for money,"" Mansfield said. ""It's also more difficult to raise money for a building that is already up and in use. People like to give money for a hole in the ground,"" he added. A member of the Community Planning Board 9, which has opposed the project becuase it doesn't feel the university adequately informed it of the dorm's impact on the community,said it still plans to hold a second public hearing. No date has been set for the hearing. Board members have complained the 23 story complex would not fit in well with the surrounding lower buildings on Morningside Drive. The complex will house about 700 students and will also include a center for the Humanities, a student activities center and 10 townhouses.PHOTO BY NICK ROMANENKO SAY GOODBYE: Demolition crew began tearing down buildings on Morningside Drive Monday to make way for the East Campus dormitory, scheduled to make appearance in 1980.MOVIN' OUT:' These buildings, seen here in pre-demolition days, will soon be swept away as campus prepares to make way for the East Campus dorm."
250,"General Ed program to celebrate 60th year CC, Humanities celebrate 60th",2 November 1978,"CC, Humanities celebrate 60thBy EILEEN TABIOSSixty years of Plato asking what is justice, incessant reference to the dichotomy of this or that and Friday finals, will be celebrated this March when the university honors the 60th anniversary of general education at Columbia. For the uninitiated, general education in the College is the required core curricula required of every student, and includes Humanities, a foreign language,and freshman composition among other things. But its essense is the Contemporary Civilization course. ""The tradition of the College's general education is derived from the Contemporary Civilization course (inaugurated) .in 1919,"" explained Paul Valliere, acting associate dean of the College. ""Because that first course provided the germ of the whole curriculum, we're using its birthday as an occasion to celebrate the whole general education program,"" stated Valliere. ""There has been a lot of discussion in universities about general education and core curriculum,"" he continued. ""Most colleges don't have a core curricula."" ""But Columbia has had a livelyB tradition of general education for 60 years. We feel that our institution has something to say and offer on the subject of general education in America,"" said Valliere Professor of English Que~ntin Anderson will deliver a keynote address on Friday evening, March 23, at Low Rotunda to kick off the celebrations. The event will continue on March 24 with a variety of panels and lectures and ""possibly a festival event,"" said Valliere. March 24 is also Columbia College's Deans' Day ""which is a grand alumni occasion where alumni and families come back, often bringing along college students or those who will soon be in college, to visit the campus for a day and hear lectures and socialize,"" added Valliere. Lectures and panels marking Deans' Day will talk about the general education curriculum. And some of the panels presented for the anniversary celebration will address problems within the present curriculum. ""One of the panels will be devoted to a round-up of ;i curricula review of Columbia College during the past two years,"" said Valliere. ""This celebration is also a selfcritical observation. Hopefully, proposals about the curriculum review and curriculum renewals will be on a table by late winter."" A luncheon devoted to the topic of general education will also be held on Thursday, March 22, at the 15th floor of the International Affairs Building. The events, including the keynote address, will be open to whoever wants to attend. Although Valliere has been coordinating the anniversary plans for the last month, he said the ongoing programs within Contemporary Civilization, Humanities, and non-Western studies have also been generating new ideas for the activities."
251,$1.75M granted to Humanities Fellows Society,23 January 1979,"By RONALD KOATZA two-part matching grant worth $1.75 million has been awarded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to the Columbia Society of Fellows in the Humanities. The money will enable the university to expand the number of post-doctoral scholars in the Society and further enable the creation of a new class of Senior Fellows in the Humanities. The Society will have offices in the Heyman Center for the Humanities, part of the proposed East Campus dormitory complex. The program allows postdoctoral students to develop new interdisciplinary or regular departmental courses in the humanities. They also do independent research. This is second award specifically allocated for post doctoral teaching fellowships in the humanities. A $2 million endowment in 1975, together with a $300,000 grant from the William R. Keenan Trust, helped to found the Society. Most of the money, a $1 million endowment, will continue present programs and increase the number of fellowships for recent Ph.D. graduates. The remaining $750,000 will go towards establishing senior fellowships for applicants with at least five years teaching experience, who qualify for a tenured teaching post but cannot get one. The program currently offers11 two-year fellowhsips to applicants who have completed their doctorates in the past two years. The money appropriated will allow the number of fellows in the program to be doubled, according to Steven Marcus, George Delacorte Professor in the Humanities and co-chairmen of the Society. ""This projected enlargement will be an invaluable aid to future interdisciplinary work in the humanities and will further strengthen the teaching of courses in the humanities and general education in the University,"" according to Marcus. The first year the fellow teaches an introductory general education course at the College such as Contemporary Civilization or Humanities. In the second year, the fellow is responsible for teaching a new course he or she has designed within one' of the departments or in one of the special programs in the College. The senior fellows will be selected by international competition in the same way the present fellows are chosen. Applicants will need at least one substantial publication and will need to show promise of continued scholarly achievement in addition to five years full-time teaching experience. The Columbia Society of Fellows in the Humanities is one of the first programs to establish postdoctoral teaching fellowships in the humanities and has been used as a model for many institutions of a similar nature."
252,Faculty and visiting scholars to conduct public examination of college core courses,23 March 1979,"By EILEEN TABIOSWhen Columbia celebrates the 60th anniversary of its general education program this weekend, the emphasis won't be on Descartes' Meditations, Latin verbs, Asian culture or even Plato's Republic. Faculty members and visiting scholars will, instead, conduct a public re-examination of Columbia College's required core curriculum which represents the oldest and one of the most influential general education programs in the country. For the uninitiated, general education in the College is the required core curricula for every student which includes Contemporary Civilization, Humanities, a foreign language, a science requirement and freshman composition. Julian Clarence Levi Professor in the Humanities Quentin Anderson will deliver the commemmoration's keynote address on the topic, ""The Particularity of General Education,"" today at 8 p.m. in Low Rotunda. Jonathan Smith of University of Chicago and Marcia Wright, professor of history, will respond to Anderson's remarks. Columbia has ""built the most stable, and at the same time, most exciting undergraduate general education curriculum in the country,"" said Paul Valliere, acting associate dean of the College and co-ordinator of the anniversary. ""Very few schools have done anything comparable,"" said Valliere. ""St. Johns College and the University of Chicago may have equal claim on the general education tradition"" but they haven't had the program for as long, Valliere added. The essence of the College's core curriculum is the Contemporary Civilization course which was instituted in 1919 to replace previous history and philosophy requirements. ""The aim of the course is to inform the student of the more outstanding and influential factors of his physical and social environment. The chief features of the intellectual, economic and political life of today will be treated and considered in their dependence on and difference from those of the past,"" said Spectator in 1919 when the course was first inaugurated. Contemporary Civilization courses were created by accident, according to James Guttman, professor emeritus of philosophy and a 1918 Columbia graduate in an article in Columbia College Today, the College alumni magazine. The course was first instituted at the government's request to plan a course on war issues to be taught in Student Army Training Corps units established at many colleges, including Columbia, when the U.S. entered World War I. ""When the war was over, it seemed to many. . .that the problems facing the post-war world could not be adequately faced by required courses in philosophy and history, which together with English A had been the foundation of our freshman program in earlier years,"" said Guttman. Masterpieces of European Literature and Philosophy (Humanities ClOOl- - formerly Humanities A) was organized in 1937 as part of theexpansion of the core curriculum. The course includes works from Homer to the 20th century. ""You can't go to an academic conference without having all sorts of discussion about general education and core curriculum today,"" said Valliere. ""There are a good many labels of snake oil being paddled around under the label of general education-core curriculum,"" Valliere continued, ""But it's not something that can just be hammered together"" unlike what we have here at Columbia, he said. Anniversary celebrations tomorrow will also coincide with the College's Dean's Day commemoration. Moore Collegiate Professor of French Donald Framewill present the Dean's Day Keynote Address, ""The Grass, the Flower and the Fruit: 40 Years of Columbia College Humanities,"" at 9:30 a.m. in Wollman Auditorium. Queen Wilhelmina Professor Jacob Smit will be discussing ""How Contemporary is Contemporary Civilization"" after the keynote address. The ""contemporary edge to CC"" was taken out when the second year of CC was abolished a few years back according to Valliere. Professor of English Carl Hovde will coordinate a second panel discussion on ""Have the Cultural Assumptions of Humanities Changed?"" Both panels take place from 10:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. in Rooms A and C at the LawBuilding. The luncheon panel at 1:45 p.m. in 1501 lAB will discuss ""What General Education Does Not Do: The Natural Sciences,"" presided over by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap and Professor of Philosophy Richard Kuhns. For reservations, call 280-2208. ""The West and the World: CrossCultural Approaches in the Liberal Arts""and ""Visual Illiteracy and the College Curriculum"" will be discussed from 2:15 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. in Rooms A and C of the Law Building. The celebrations will be concluded by a General Assembly of Dean's Day at 4 p.m. in Wollman Auditorium. All activities are open to the public.Quentin Anderson ...keynote speaker"

254,ADP: The Bacchae is original but excessive features theater,6 April 1979,"featurestheaterBy FRED BALZACNo one would deny the difficulty of interpreting Euripides' classic, The Bacchae. As literature, it marks the end of Aristotelian tragedy. Pentheus lacks the greatness of the tragic heroes of Aeschylus and Sophocles, while the character of Dionysus defies classification in Aristotelian terms. The play is even more difficult to interpret on stage. Subjects such as ritual sacrifice, madness, and sexual ambiguity and perversion require imagination and subtle control. Jefferson Bogursky's production of The Bacchae, now at the Alpha Delta Phi Playhouse, is only half successful. The ambitious undertaking is highly original,but also terribly excessive. Temporal styles clash, the acting and the direction are uneven, and the evening wears on a little too long. Jeff Bogursky is a talented man; but he has overextended himself. Besides directing, producing, and playing the part of Cadmus, he has adapted the script, using both the Greek text and English translations. The adaption is quite fine, at times even poetic. Occasionally, it gets a bit too literal, such as when Tiresias tells Pentheus, ""Bacchus is your blood."" Bogursky employs colloquial expressions in an attempt to give the play a modern flavor.But the sporadic use of them make it appear as if they were thrown in. Linguistic differences should have been made an integral part of the script, or the colloquialisms should not have been used at all. Otherwise, the adaption enhances the play. It alone would have made Bogursky's achievement quite impressive. As a director, however, he is somewhat less successful. Intensity on stage is sustained throughout the evening, but the play never takes off, it never dances. Its length is one problem. The intermission (coming after a 90 minute first act) severely hampers any dramatic build-up. As with all Greek tragedies, the climactic moment occurs offstage; if tension does not continually increase, the emotional wallop, the catharsis of ""pity and fear,"" will never come. Instead of such a climax, the audience is left with a.stagey ending that fails to deliver. Conceptually, too, the production is flawed. Bogursky has added a difference in temporal style to the conflict between Pentheus and Dionysus, seeing a correlation between ancient Greek society and American society of the Sixties. But the allusion is barely suggested in the production. Like the colloquialisms, the difference in style is not developed to the point where it relates to the theme of the play. The difference is nothing more than a difference in costume and speaking style. As director, Bogursky must share the blame for the inconsistency of the acting. The inexperienced cast is energetic but nonetheless misdirected. Bogursky himself, as Cadmus, lacks depth. His performance is no indication of the talent he displayed in Moonchildren two years ago. His Cadmus and John Malcolm's Tiresias are portrayed stereotypically: slow walk, bent over, craggy voice —Malcolm goes so far as to play the blind Tiresias with his eyes closed. Both actors do have some stage presence, however, and they are fun to watch in their vaudeville shtick early in the play. David Goldberg as Dionysus has physical and vocal command of the stage. He injects personality and wit into his character, and is appropriately androgynous. As his nemesis, Michael Dee, however, is nothing more than properly boyish. Dee plays Pentheus all on one level, relying too much on facialexpression. His intentions are all correct, but he does not internalize them. Dee improves in the latter half of the play, when the perversion of Pentheus becomes obvious. Most of the energy in the i£ consumed and produced )j% the chorus (Evelyn Laßali, Kris Russel, Michelene Pantano, Beth Rubenstein, and Wendy White). These actresses are simply overworked arra underdirected. They are on stage all the time, they act, sing, dance, and react to everything done on stage by the other actors. Their efforts are admirable, but the director should have polished their performances some more or not have asked them to do so much. Overshadowed by Bogursky's achievement are Lou-Anne Kroutil and David Curry, who composed and directed the music. The music if fine, for the most part, but it does not warrant its extensive use. Much of it sounds repetitive, and its over-use is the reason for the play's length, in terms of both time and interest. Again, it is another example of not knowing where and when to draw the line. Bob Bessoir's lighting is good, aside from the occasional use of glaring red. The ADP Playhouse is beautiful. Perfect for The Bacchae, this shrine should be used more often. The Bacchae, with all its flaws, warrants viewing. It is Humanities A come alive. Bogursky and friends have fleshed it out properly; it is unfortunate that they are unable to transmit theirintensity beyond the stage and into the audience. The Bacchae is at 8 p.m. tonight through Sunday. ADP Playhouse is at 526 W. 114 th Street.Michael Dee"
255,Federal funding of CU research tops $100M mark,21 September 1979,"By ROBERT POLNERResearch funding from government sources exceeded $100 million for the first time in Columbia's history during the 1978-79 fiscal year, a quarterly report on government-sponsored projects shows. The report, published by Columbia's Office of Projects and Grants, revealed a $14 million jump in the last fiscal year over the 1977-78 figures, bringing the total to $110.5 million in government aid for university research. Monies for research come from a variety of major government sources on city, state, and federal levels. Among the largest sources are the U.S. Public Health Service, the Departments of Defense and Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the National Foundation for the Artsand Humanities. A closer look at the quarterly summary revealed, too, a sharp funding increase for the final quarter of the fiscal year. Columbia was awarded $4.9 million more in government grants in the last quarter than in the third quarter. The U.S. Public Health Service, the single largest source of government funding this fiscal year, raised its contribution by more than $2.5 million in the last quarter. The bulk of U.S. Health Service funding was given to the College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S). This aid represents ""the lion's share of government money"" donated in the final quarter, according to James Lewis, the Director of Projects and Grants. Accordingly, P&S posted the largest divisional gain for the quarter, an increase of $3 million over the preceding quarter. Second to P&S as a source for government grants was Columbia's LamontDoherty Geological Observatory, which netted an additional $300,000 over the last quarter.Lamont-Doherty, located in Palisades, N.Y. on the Hudson River, is a good illustration of how research funds can be put to use. The observatory's research includes earthquake seismology—which attracted increased aid, in part, because it is a growing field—marine geology, geophysics and geochemistry. Lamont-Doherty operates two ocean research vessels, currently stationed in the Western Pacific and the Easter Atlantic Oceans. Less than six months ago, Lamont-Doherty was given a computer system by the U.S. Geology Society to facilitate further research in seismology. The Office of Projects and Grants also publishes weekly summaries of government research funding."

259,Cautious BC vetoes housing swap,18 March 1981,"By TODD BRESSIEfforts to increase coeducation in the dormitories collapsed last week because Barnard wants to approach the issue of cooperation as a ""whole picture"" and not in ""bits and pieces,"" Barnard Vice President for Student Affairs Barbara Schmitter said yesterday. Barnard Interim President Ellen Futter ""did not reject"" the latest proposal, which would have allotted Barnard 105 beds in East Campus, 49 in Carman and 10 more inHartley and in Livingston, Schmitter said. ""She just wasn't able to accept it at the moment,"" she explained. ""We are interested in getting everything straightened out at once, not in little pieces,"" she said. The housing trade is ""part of a bigger picture"" and Barnard must determine ""how it fits in"" with the cooperation issue, Schmitter said. She said ""the whole picture"" is being discussed by Futter, Barnard Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Olton and Columbia Provosts Peter Likins and Fritz Stern. Likins said earlier this year the ""informal"" discussions concerned ""dining halls, dorms, and classes."" Schmitter would not rule out the possibility that a trade of freshman spaces could still be arranged, but she said she does not know what Futter, Olton and the provosts are discussing.""She's very much not talking about what she's talking about with other people,"" Schmitter said. Likins said Monday night the talks with Futter had left him ""less optimistic"" about whether the College and Barnard could achieve further cooperation through the talks. According to sources, one of the topics discussed at the talks was a proposal to make Masterpieces of European Literature and Philosophy (Literature Humanities) a Barnard core requirement. Officials on the schools' Committees on Instruction, however, said they have not been asked to consider such a proposal. College Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal said he had heard only ""rumors"" of the idea, and that a proposal had not reached the COIs.He would not comment further. The Barnard COI ""tossed the idea around"" earlier this semester in a discussion of the schools' requirements, Schmitter said. Barnard students can use Literature Humanities to fulfill their distribution requirement. She said if a proposal came before the Barnard COI it ""would get a sympathetic, serious discussion,"" but she said she could not predict whether the measure would pass.SPECTATOR PHOTO OVER AND OUT GOOD BUDDY: A protestor cheers on his fellow picketers in front of Harlem Hospital last night.Peter IJkins . less optimisl'u"
260,Teacher as pupil,20 April 1981,"By FRED BALZACIf professors were gods, D'Acierno would be Zeus, from Columbia Course Guide, Fall 1976Pellegrino D'Acierno is leaning forward over the first row of students, his fist raised, his face full of terror. ""Lear rages against— the nothingness."" He maintains the pose for a moment. It is the climax of a discussion which began less than an hour before with Montaigne and the notion of everydayness. Then, like one of Michelangelo's slaves breaking out of his marble cell, D'Acierno emerges from the thought. ""Okay. Okay. We'll take a break."" The class is Lit. Hum., and Pellegrino D'Acierno is—unquestionably —its teacher. As in most of his classes,_he began the discussion of Lear with a question. ""Who behaves naturally?"" While the professor paces, a student demures publicly. ""It's not a killer question, not a bloodsucking question,"" D'Acierno says to him. ""I've asked this question of all my Humanities classes."" And so it goes. He will pose a question and if it goes unanswered, he will provide clues, ask related questions, speak in an extended monologue punctuated with ellipses until a student risks a response. Turning to the text, D'Acierno reads Cordelia's speech. ""Now what is this, loving according to her bond, and how does it relate to acting naturally?"" A few attempts are unsatisfactory. ""Loving according to her bond means what? . . . What?"" D'Acierno says he's mellowed in the last five years, and he's probably correct. No longer does he charge around the classroom with boundless energy. The tone is more relaxed now. But the intensity of thought remains, the words still build toa climactic pianissimo, and the results—as anyone could see from looking around the classroom—are the same. v A student brings up Edgar's victory over Edmund. ""Who behaves naturally,"" D'Acierno asks, ""Edmund or Edgar?"" ""Edmund behaves unnaturally,"" replies the student. ""What about Edmund? What is he?"" ""A bastard,"" says the class is unison. ""A bastard. Sartre says we're all astards. In fairy stories the bastard turns out to be the good son. What happens in Lear? The bastard turns out to be a bastard."" The students laugh. You can see it in their faces. You can tell from the way they take notes, which is not automatic. You can see it in the ellipses between questions. They are thinking. These students form a particularly special Humanities class. Not that they are much different from any of D'Acierno's previous classes. They are special because they are the last. Pelligrino D'Acierno is leaving Columbia. In an interview a few days earlier, D'Acierno talked about his philosophy of teaching. ""The notions of traditional humanism and of the university as a benign and autonomous structure that shelters an historicist and humanist idealism have to be examined. Our students must be involved in a form of education by which they're made to function counter-hegemonically—in other words, to question some of the assumptions of humanism itself and the society that produced humanism as its ideology, as its discourse on 'spiritual values.* My goal was to have my students become critical humanists, negative humanists, not only by questioning the curriculum andthe ideology that's built into it, but also to consider, criticize, subvert, rethink, reform, the whole relationship between student and teacher."" He cites Antonio Gramsci's dictum that ""every teacher is always a pupil and every pupil a teacher."" ""What he means is that the teacher must learn how to examine and to resist his own role as teacher—to learn, finally, how to block his own microfascism, to check his own ideological baggage which he brings to the role of teaching, many times unconsciously ..."" One of the ways in which he's tried to resist this role of the teacher has been to encourage his students to be active in class, ""to forge and to share a discourse,"" he says. ""And that's one of the ways in which I conceived the teaching of Humanities: an activity which produced collectively a way of sharing the text."" D'Acierno doesn't lecture in class, and he works hard to include all his students in the discussion. ""The premise is that everyone has to speak, because in speaking everyone has to make mistakes. Only by making mistakes does one acquire the means of correction, and correction should be public. You must risk the mistake in order to produce the correction."" In a society in which he says ""the old humanism has been defeated by the pragmatic humanism of modern technocracy,"" D'Acierno thinks of himself as a catalyst who can inspire the ""organic intellectuals"" (e.g. lawyers, doctors, professors) to resist the role society has laid out for them. ""I don't wantmy students to be ideological dupes or burgeois narcissists,"" he adds. ""You know the sequence of names on Butler Library: Cicero, Aristotle.. names should really be Ford, Rockefeller.. .and once one relizes this, it becomes historically impossible to keep intact the premises of the traditional intellectual. What must happen is that we must realize that we're all organic intellectuals. We're all being produced by the dominant class, and the only kind of freedom we're going to have is marginal, negative, provisional."" D'Acierno conceived his teaching of the Humanities A course in similar terms: he wanted his students ""to learn how to resist the transmission of the classics... you learn the tradition not purely for the sake of transmission—to reproduce it and be reproduced by it—but in order to master it so that you can oppose it and appropriate your own history from it."" He advocates required courses in nonWestern culture and in theory because a knowledge of critical theory, Marx, semiotics, structural linguistics and Gramsci, is essential if a student is ""to be able to cope with modern culture—popular bourgeois."" D'Acierno, who once said, ""The teacher is a man who finishes his sentences. I don't finish my sentences,"" notes that much of his teaching ""has been based on the art of suggestion, on the art of hinting. In other words, conceiving the performance of teaching is almost in poetic terms and doing the things that a good poem does—leaving certain things concealed, interrupting so that such interruptions and gaps bring forth the response of the student. Thestudent has to complete the sentence. ""Of course, this is a dangerous game to play. I don't know if I can play it or if I do play it anymore.. .Is it right to teach by difficulty? Is it right to teach by suggestion? Is it more productive to simply give facts? Perhaps if we were to follow Walter Benjamin, we would teach by giving shocks Unconventional in his approach to Humanities, D'Acierno gives oral midterm and final exams and allows his students to write creative papers in place of the standard explication de texte. He rejects ""the concept of mediocre work;"" however. ""I expect my students to be excellent—the only premise that dignifies the student. First of all, they have to read five more texts than the other sections because we do this juxtaposition of classical and modern texts."" He says that he has ""always believed in the absolute intelligence of my Columbia students"" and that they are among the best the College has produced. ""I taught through difficulty. I had my students do some enormously complicated analyses. We'd be doing things—innocently and without jargon—certain complicated structuralist and semiotic readings of texts from the very start."" A teacher since 1972 and a member of the Columbia community since he entered the College as a freshman in 1961, D'Acierno is preparing for the end of what he freely professes has been a love affair with Columbia. Although he's not leaving the Heights altogether—he's accepted a position as assistant director of Barnard's Center for Scholarly Exchange—the professor will be taking his unique teaching tools elsewhere in the fall. D'Acierno is, as he says, ""ready to explode"" with all the work he's been generating over the last several years. Two of the books, Fellini and the Cinema of Repetition and The Broken Text are direct results of courses he's taught. The Itinerary of the Sign, a semiotic analysis of Italian fresco cycles, is ready for publication, with a volume of poetry, tentatively called The Death of the Dandy, and a critical edition of a work by Manfredo Tafuri ready to follow. ""Columbia has afforded me a marvelous pedagogic opportunity. I had a chance to make my mistakes, my misreadings, in public and I've used this experience to produce my M|ork. So I'm greatly in debt to Columbia and to my students for generating those texts."" He says he is not really bitter about not being considered for tenure, though. ""First of all, I had no expectations of tenure from the start. My position in the Italian Department—it was very clear—was a cul-de-sac ... ""I think it's a terrible disfiguring process. It's disfiguring to the assistant professor, who's an endangered species whether he has either published or perished. It's a deformation, it renders him most predictable: those people who will follow a certain itinerary of publication for preferment will thrive (perish through publishing). I'm leery of any system, of any tribunal, that doesn't render differences, that doesn't take into account particular situations, particular sensibilities. For those who perish, it's humiliating, it'sdishonoring. The occupational hazard of assistant professors is becoming an Underground Man a la Dostoevsky. ""But I think in a larger sense, it's disfiguring to the department ... To set up this adversarial rapport between Jr. and Sr. faculty where Sr. faculty are viewed as obstacles. It's a paranoid situation, where different generations and the sensibilities that the culture of those generations produced are set at odds ..."" It's also disfiguring to the University at large—especially to the Univesity, because the University as such is not organic. It's rubbing out all the people who grew up under Eisenhower and were nurtured on the Eisenhower logos, and I think that's dangerous. ""The system of tenure is like Plato's myth of the metals. It's a pragmatic myth. Everyone knows it's false. Even full professors realize it's just a pragmatic myth. It has nothing to do with real valueor with recognizing and fostering excellence. It's a way of making a business efficient, and I don't think that efficiency should be at the heart of it. ""So I think the University is disfigured because it doesn't reproduce itself organically. You impose this myth of hierarchy where instead a dialectical operation should be taking place in which one generation is sublating, overcoming, but int he same way extending and preserving, the sensibility of the previous generation which formed them. And thatseems to me a healthy university: one that's organic, one that has this continuity along generational lines. It seems that everyone in my generation is now gone — "" To reform the tenure system, D'Acierno advocates allowing assistant professors more time, including sabbaticals, to produce the work they need to attain tenure; taking into consideration what he calls ""productive"" teaching; and giving the student a voice in the tenure process. (""At Columbia, the student has absolutely no rights as a consumer in determining who will be his teacher. Of course, the University has the advantage in that four years the assistant professor is completely rubbed out""). But above all, he insists that Columbia must replace its hierarchical system with this dialectic between professors if it is to remain preeminent. ""The University, as far as I can see, has dismissed a more distinguished faculty in the last couple of years that it now has ..."" The conversation turned to other topics: movies, Marxism, Catholicism, Italy. As the tape raced to its conclusion, D'Acierno offered some final thoughts about what he'll be leaving behind at Columbia. ""I worry about certain things. I worry about who's going to teach Gramsci, who's going to teach Vico and the modern tradition of Italian humanism ... I worry about, again, who will see the classroom as a place for counter-hagemonic struggle. ""Perhaps these worries are part of my Columbia blues. In any case"
261,Secret report attacks CC admissions Two schools have moved fast in a year to alter relationship,15 September 1981,"Two schools have moved fast in a year to alter relationshipBy TODD BRESSIWhen the informal ""talks"" between then-Barnard Interim President Ellen Futter and the university provosts were announced last October, no one predicted that within a year the schools would be close to reordering their relationship. Those ""talks"" now involve President Sovern and are openly called ""negotiations."" They have also'progressed to where Sovern could say last month that the issue of whether the College will admit women or work more closely with Barnard to establish ""de facto"" coeducation could be settled within weeks. At the start, the talks were described merely as an attempt to restore the dialogue between the schools that fell apart under the administrations of President William McGill and Barnard President Jacquelyn Mattfeld. But at the time, students, faculty members and officials in the College were beginning to push for a change in its single-sex status. The arrangement with Barnard, they said, hurt the College's social atmosphere and lowered the quality of its admissions pool. In November, the College Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid issued a document—known as the Feinbergquality of its admissions pool. In November, the College Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid a document—known as the Feinberg report, after committee chairman and Professor of Physics Gerald Feinberg—that recommended the College admit women to increase its share of talented students. The committee based its decision largely on the confidential admissions data later included in the confidential part of another faculty report on coeducation and published in Spectator today. The committee discounted any hope of attaining ""a much more integrated arrangement with Barnard than exists at present,"" because ""such integration has been under discussion for several years with no perceptable progress towards the goal."" The College faculty, by an overwhelming majority, authorized the creation last fall of a panel to explore the Feinberg report. The group, composed of faculty members, students, officials and alumni, was headed by Professor of Chemistry Ronald Breslow and began meeting last semester. In February, Provost Peter Likins said the talks concerned ""dining halls, dorms and classes."" Sources said they also concerned the tenure process and a proposal to make Literature Humanities a Barnard core requirement. The gravity of those talks became apparent when a proposal at the College level to trade dorm spaces between Carman and Reid Halls for this academic year fell through. According to Barnard Vice President for Student Affairs Barbara Schmitter, Barnard wanted to address the issue ofcooperation as a ""whole picture"" and not in ""bits and pieces."" Sovern monitored the progress of Breslow's committee and met repeatedly with him. Breslow's report, released in mid-April, reiterated the recommendation that the College admit women. ""Limited arrangements would fall far short of meeting Columbia's basic requirement for a stronger applicant pool,"" it said. Within a week of its release, the report was approved overwhelmingly by a vote of the College faculty. ' From there, Sovern emerged as the figure who would bring together the two movements toward coeducation: the one represented by the Breslow report, the other, by the high-level talks seeking greater cooperation. Sovern managed to do that in an interview with The New York Times over the summer. The College, he said, will admit women on its own unless Barnard agrees to a degree of cooperation acceptable to Columbia students. In the same interview, he revealed that the two schools had reached an agreement in principle on the tenure-granting arrangement between the schools so that Barnard and Columbia would have an equal say in making tenure appointments—a key issue in the talks up to then. The president said also that thechief stumbling blocks in the negotiations concerned entirely coeducational dorms and dining halls, and the College's required Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities courses. University officials insisted these classes had to become required courses under any sort of de facto system. By late August and early September, the negotiators ap-, peared to be closing in on an accord. Top officials from both sides indicated that several of the key issues—including tenure and core requirements—had been settled in principle. For his part, Sovern said he wanted to report on the subject to the University Senate by its Sept. 18 session and bring the issue before the Board of Trustees at its «Oct. 5.SPECTATOR/NICK ROMANENKO . . .coeducation as perceived by studentsSPECTATOR/NICK ROMANENKO . . .preserve Barnard's autonomy"
262,Workshops to be worth full credit,18 November 1982,"By PHILIPPE ADLERThe writing workshops in College courses will be replaced next year by several independent composition classes, after the grant that finances the workshops expires. Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the College, said that the single credit workshops designed to improve students' writing skills in their major fields were ""very successful in many ways,"" but that erratic class sizes had forced the College to abandon the workshops in favor of five or six three-point writing courses. Rosenthal said that enrollment in the workshops had varied from five to 15 students, but many students in the classes had dropped out midway through the semester. ""That's what happens in a one-point course,"" he said. ""Students are not going to write six or seven papers for just one credit."" The workshops, funded by a grant fromthe Mellon Foundation that runs out in May, had been offered for the past two years in courses in the philosophy, art history, political science, religion, english, history and anthropology departments. They were taught by graduate students who attended the regular classes attached to the workshops and assigned essays on course topics. Rosenthal said the details of the composition classes that will operate in place of the workshops had not been formulated, but he added that he expected at least one of the classes to be offered in the social sciences and another in the humanities. A writing course could also be offered in the natural sciences, he said. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Carl Hovde, whose American Literature course offered a writing workshop, called the program ""a step in the right direction."" He said he had not expected the College to accept the workshop program as it was instituted. Hovde said the workshop program ""sparks interest in the class because students write about the class."" David Yerkes, professor of English and comparative literature and director of composition in the College, said the pro-gram ""is greatly in demand by students and by faculty."" None of the faculty members contacted criticized the workshops, but each said a shortage of funds had necessitated the shift to several larger writing classes. They said the five or six independent classes would make the program more economical than it is now. Rosenthal said the College should experiment with the program after the Mellon grant expires. ""It's time to build it into part of the program. It's a serious enough enterprise to be a course in itself,"" he said. ""We must see how the departments feel about writing,"" he added."

264,"Spectator Spectrum AT ISSUE: New syllabus decision is just ""the beginning""",29 January 1986,"AT ISSUE:New syllabus decision is just ""the beginning""By CARL F. HOVDEOne of the snappier remarks about Humanities A was made by the late Moses Hadas, a distinguished classicist who was fond of the course and taught it for many years. ' 'The name, he said, ""should be changed. The first semester should be called 'Books', and the second 'More Books'."" I persist in calling it ""Humanities A"" because I dislike the current ""Literature Humanities""; it is not, and should not be, only literature. Hadas' comment reflects the difficulty of defining precisely what Humanities does. The works are read in chronological order, but the course is not really one in the history of anything: not of Greek thought, not of French, not of anyother. No course can responsibly be called history which moves so rapidly with so thin a sense of context. What it does do is direct attention to a sizeable number of major Western texts; students read and discuss a good many works of literature, history, and philosophy—not enough philosophy now, I think. The discussion is the essence; a teacher who lectured all the time would not be doing the job. The staff members work hard to make the experience valuable in itself, and they hope that it will also lead students to learn more about those authors and periods that they find particularly interesting.The course should lead students to come back later to Montaigne, or to Sophocles, or to Homer and think more about the issues, whether this is done in or out of the classroom. When the staff talks about the syllabus the discussion of the spring list is always longer and more difficult than that about the fall. In significant measure the fall list was created by the disappearance of many of the works not on it: there were many more Greek playwrights than those whose work we read, and even with the four we have most of their works have been lost. In the second term, on the other hand, the problem is to choose between an increasingly large number of available works, and the staff discussion is naturally colored by the varying backgrounds and interests represented. The essential thing is the basic assumption about the course—that when the staff settles on a work, it will be taught in all classes. Last term, in the discussion of works to be taught this spring, the staff for the first time decided that the list should contain a work by a woman. The Princess of Cleves was initially chosen, but Pride and Prejudice was the final choice. There was some feeling (which I shared) that George Eliot's Middlemarch would be more appropriate, since it has a massiveness and cultural complexity characteristic of most of the other Humanities texts. But I have no doubt that the Austen novel will work well in class; it is obviously one of the finest novels in English, and a preference for Middiemarch in this context doesn't mean that one thinks Eliot a greater novelist than Austen. Humanities is only part of the core curriculum, and the core is in turn only part of a student's experience here. The thing for us all to remember is that the introduction of a work by a woman is not the end of our necessary thought, but rather the beginning. Women's Studies in general are at an early stage of their development at Columbia, though for some individual teachers it is not a new matter at all, of course. The College, like the University, has been giving attention to Women's Studies in recent years, but this has necessarily been in the form of committee investigations, reports, and some curricular experiments. What happens in Humanities cannot and must not be isolated from what is happening elsewhere in the curriculum, and we must inform ourselves about these other lines of inquiry.Next year will see, among other anniversaries, the fiftieth year that Humanities has been a required course. It has remained a vital enterprise above all else because of the committment of those teaching it, and their willingness to work together in a fruitful way. There are fresh interests now, and all of this is going to require some organized attention in addition to individual thought. It is necessary that we press ourinterests with civility and some patience in a context of inevitably varying opinion; I am sure that we will do this. Even if there were to be some rancor, there is one thing much worse: indifference. If the staff should ever cease to care, the course would surely die of its own weight—but of this, lam happy to report, there is not the slightest sign.Pride and Prejudice in Lit HumCarl F.

265,CC preceptors outraged by fellowship cuts,29 September 1986,"By JOSH GILETTE and STEPHEN WESTSome graduate and preceptors of Contemporary Civilization (CC) are threatening to withhold grades or strike after they learned last week they may not receive paid sabbaticals that they say they were promised two yers ago. A groups of preceptors decided at a meeting last week to send Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack and Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal a letter asking them to reinstate the fellowship program that gave preceptors who taught six consecutive semesters of CC or Literature Humanities a semester of paid sabbatical. Some preceptors said they would consider stronger action if the letter brought no response. ""We can get the senior faculty behind us, or we can strike or withhold grades,"" said preceptor Peter Judson, a history graduate student. ""Refusing to teach is a last resort."" But according to Columbia College administrators, chairs of departments involved in teaching CC wereinstructed in 1984 to tell their graduate students not to expect the grants.But those responsible in the history and philosophy departments said they were not aware that it was solely their responsibility to inform the preceptors about the stipend cut-off, and blamed the mix-up on poor communication with the Columbia College administration. Pollack said the school may makethe grants this year to avoid giving ""a nasty surprise"" to the 10 to 12 third-year preceptors currently affected by the decision. ""I am faced with a group of graduate preceptors who say their chairman never told them,"" he said. ""I may find myself actually obliged to keep a promise that I never made."" Rosenthal said administrators hope to decide this week whether the college can afford grants for the graduate students who thought they were to receive $4,300, their usual preceptor stipend, after teaching CC for three continuous years. The grants, part of the Chamberlain fellowship program, are still being offered to junior faculty members who teach Lit Hum and CC. Bu • ( 112 e p iwarr would definitely be cancelled for any graduate students who began teaching core curriculum classes after 1984. According to Pollack, College administrators decided to begin offering Chamberlains to graduatestudents in 1972, when they had difficulty finding instructors to teach core curriculum classes. The Chamberlains had been available for junior faculty since the 1950'5, as away of compensating them for diverting their attention away from their normal work. Preceptors hired to begin teaching CC in the fall of 1984 said they were told of the Chamberlain program in interviews with Rosenthal and Richard Brilliant, head of the CC program and were never told that Columbia College had decided to stop making the grants. ""I've now found out in my third year of teaching that I am not going to be getting what was explicitly discussed in my interview."" said CC preceptor Michael Sugrue, a history graduate student. Brilliant could not be reached for comment. According to Pollack, he decided to discontinue the grants to preceptors because he believes the money, which comes from Columbia College alumni donations should go to Columbia College students instead of students from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). ""I cannot take the money from my students,"" Pollack said. ""I cannot see the College paying them (the preceptors) to be graduate students."" He added that he may try to work out an agreement with GSAS to help pay the graduate students who thought they were promised the fellowships. The dispute over the Chamberlains also threatens to hurt the relationships between Columbia College administrators and departments with core curriculum preceptors. History department chair John Garraty said that if the 10 to 12 preceptors in the current dispute are not given the Chamberlain he would consider next year withholding the 12 to 15 preceptors his department usually sends to CC. Professor of History James Shenton said last Thursday that he had not heard of any changes in the Chamberlain program \ and considers the paid sabbatical an important attraction for the preceptors. ""I wouldn't recommend that my graduate student (advisees) take the position if there were no Chamberlains,"" he said. But Rosenthal said he does not expect the pool of preceptors to dry up now that the College has stopped offering the grants. ""I don't think the Chamberlain—which was always a nice thing—was ever the deciding factor,"" he said. ""Those students will still receive three years of support and three years of active involvment in a rich and interesting student body and curriculum."" Graduate students selected to teach CC are informed of theirappointment by the chair of the department in which they are doing graduate work. Rosenthal said department heads were informed in the spring of 1984 that the College might not offer the Chamberlains to newly hired preceptors. ""It (the letter) said the department chairman should make sure no one was taking the job with the expectation of getting a Chamberlain,"" Rosenthal said. Heads of several departments with CC graduate preceptors blamed the confusion on poor communication with Columbia College administrators. Philosophy Professor James Walsh, who advises his department's preceptors, said Rosenthal's letter did not explicitly say that newly hired preceptors would not receive Chamberlains. ""I think that Rosenthal thought it was implicit for any intelligent reader,"" Walsh said. ""I was not that intelligent. In my view it was Dean Rosenthal's responsibility, in his view it was mine."" Walsh said he recently sent a letter to philosophy department preceptors accepting ""some responsibility"" for the confusion. Rosenthal said he thought the letter was adequate notification and he added that Lit Hum preceptors apparently understood that they would not receive the grants. ""Half the world seems to know and half doesn't,"" he said. ""In hindsight a different procedure would have been appropriate. I thought that I had in fact done what was necessary."" Lit Hum head and English Professor James Mirollo said he had informed the English graduate students appointed to be Lit Hum preceptors that they would not receive Chamberlains and that preceptors from other departments had apparently heard from their departments. Miroilo explained that when Rosenthal's April 1984 letter was written, Columbia administrators did not think they would be able to offer the grants to graduate students. But because no final decision had been made, the letter did not explicitly rule out the possbility of Chamberlains for the preceptors, he added. Professor of History Ainslie Embree, Chair of History Department from 1982-85 s.iid he could not remember if he had informed new preceptors of the 1984 change in the Chamberlain program. He said that because any decisions concerning Chamberlains are madfc by the Columbia College administration, any discussion of the stipend would not occur on the departmental level.Robert Pollack"
266,Lit Hum's 50th anniversary celebrated at annual dean's day,27 April 1987,"By Melissa Michelson""The way we do the course is the real secret of the success of the Humanities A program,"" English Department Chair James Mirollo said at the Dean's Day gathering of over 800 students and alumni on Saturday for the fiftieth anniversary of the Literature Humanities program. According to Alumni Affairs Director Jack Murray, over 30,000 people have taken the course since it was established in 1937. Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack spoke about the humanities program and how it affects students. ""As some of you know, in this decade Columbia College's treatment of Literature Humanities has expanded and tends to broaden the interpretation of texts,"" he said. ""The state at Columbia College is one of robust health,"" he said. ""The best way I know of to tell you about this is when my wife Amy and I went to the varsity show and I cannot remember the melody, but there was one rhyme that made the rhyme of Augustine and Larry Wein. I guess that's the state of Columbia College."" Mirollo spoke on the history of Humanities 'A.' ""Whatever else we may say of the course, we must never forget that it is our students who are the ultimate judge of its value,"" he said. ""To all accounts they have loved it."" ""In the fall of 1937, the urging question must have been,will it work,"" Mirollo said, adding, ""The planners seemed to be a bit too optimistic about the amound ot reading the students could do."" ""We are, as were our predecesors, committed to orchestrating in the two hours alloted us, an exciting and creative flow of conversation, which often involves shutting ourselves up,"" he said. Mirollo also spoke about the mix of faculty and grauduate preceptors that teach the course. ""The course badly needs experience and the wisdom that experience brings, [but sometimes] we are not able to borrow as many senior professors as we would like,"" he said. ""[However], the staff needs a mix."" Mirollo also illustrated how the syllabus of the course has changed over the years. ""A total of 130 books have been read in Humanities A over the last 50 years,"" he said. ""There has never been a concrete list that has been read every year."" According to Mirollo, this year some books written by black authors are being read as professors' choice, but the department has not decided to include black authors on the curriculum, although it has been discussed. ""The large question for the future is whether the course is worth preserving, and, if so, what purpose can it be expected to serve and in what form,"" Mirollo said. ""It is an ideal placeto make a statement or make a change."" ""[The books] have important things to say to us about ourselves and to other members of our planet,"" he said. Following the speeches, ten separate lectures were held on the texts. Assistant Professor of Classics Laura Slatkin spoke about Homer's Odyssey to about 150 alumni and students. ""The task for us is not only to show how modern it [the Odyssey] is, which it is, but also how distinctively Greek it is,"" Slatkin said. ""It is an integral paradox of the Odyssey that war both destroys and constitutes civilization."" Assistant Professor of English David Damrosch lectured on Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Euripides' Medea to approximately 150 alumni and students. ""The current state of the Humanities course involves a certain degree of working against its own traditions,"" he said. ""As it always is in Humanities, the question is, how the dialogues we set up with these texts alters our views of these texts."""

269,Retired profs will teach core through new Heyman project,16 September 1988,"By Penny BritellSo you thought you couldn't take that great history class because the professor is retiring? Wrong—thanks to the new Society of Senior Scholars, coordinated by the Heyman Center for the Humanities, retired professors will return to the cldssft)om to tfeach the corecurriculum. John Mitchell Mason Professor Win. Theodore deßary first conceived the idea for such a program in 1975, when he organized the Columbia Society of Fellows in the Humanities, a program for postdoctoral fellows teaching the core curriculum. ""At the time, I felt we should be doing something for senior scholars,"" deßary said. ""[The Society of Senior Scholars] is something that retires people in a regular way but at the same time keeps them busy."" The Society of Senior Scholars increases the number of faculty teaching the core curriculum, while at the same time freeing positions to allow younger professors to advance, deßary said. ""The student population isn't shrinking, so instead of adding more post-graduate students to teach thecore [curriculum], we add senior staff—in a way that neither imbalances the staff nor thwarts the advancement of younger faculty,"" he explained. The Society was established at the Heyman Center with a $340,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The first members of the Society are MacDowell Professor Emeritus of Music Jack Beeson, Moore Collegiate Professor Emeritus of Art History Howard Davis, University Professor Emeritus Louis Henkin, former Director of the Pew Initiative in Diplomatic Training and Professor Emeritus of History Graham Irwin, Avalon Professor Emeritus in the Humanities Joseph Mazzeo, Professor of Oriental Studies John Meskill, former Professor of Music Joel Newman, Adlai Stevenson Professor Emeritus of International Relations Marshall Shulman, and Adjunct Professor of Japanese History Arthur Tiedemann. ""We're very fortunate that we have such a large number of distinguished faculty who are not only willing to join the program but who are extremely enthusiastic about it,"" deßary said. The Senior Scholars, who must be between the ages of 65 and 75, will each teach one course per semester and participate in the activities of the Society and the Humanities colloquia at the Heyman Center, according todeßary. ""Some [Senior Scholars] are already teaching—others have existing commitments, * such as Professors Shulman and Henkin. Others are being brought out of retirement, but eventually all of them will be teaching the core curriculum,"" deßary said. The Society of Senior Scholars will assist in the training of younger scholars, according to Vice President for Arts and Sciences Jonathan Cole. ""[The Society] is an extraordinarily exciting and interesting idea,"" Cole said. ""Ted deßary has put together a group of senior scholars with years of devotion to teaching in the core curriculum [who are] enormous additions to the faculty. We won't lose [the] treasure [of] their expertise,"" he added. Senior Scholar Graham Irwin voiced similar sentiments. ""I'm not immediately going to be teaching again—[but] I hope next year to be teaching Contemporary Civilization,"" Irwin said. Senior Scholar Howard Davis said he is pleased to return to teach humanities as a member of the Society. ""I think it's a good program—what it achieves is to bring experienced people back to teach after retirement. I loved the Art Humanities course, and I'm looking forward to teaching it again,"" Davis said.Wm. Theodore deßary"
270,Core Comm.: Inclusion of non-Western texts up to profs.,7 October 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalThe committee reviewing Columbia College's core curriculum decided yesterday that unless instructors teaching first-semester Literature Humanities strongly favor adding non-Western texts to the course's reading list, the committee will not recommend their inclusion when it issues its report in December. ""We've decided on that [limiting Humanities A] tentatively until we've reviewed the whole range of issues,"" said Commission Chair William Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University. ""For the time being, we've reasoned that it's not practical to include non-Western texts.""Including a few non-Western texts in the syllabi would be a token gesture that would not do justice to any of the works and would destroy the cohesiveness of the course, some committee members have argued. ""Adding non-Western texts may just displace something of major importance, and it's not worth it if you have to leave out major works such as Shakespeare,"" deßary said. Committee members have also said they do not think many faculty members can adequately teach and incorporate non-Western texts into the Humanities A course.""People just teach a course [fora short time] and then get rotated out of the system just when they're beginning to understand and teach the material. Part of the problem is keeping professors in the program [teaching core classes],"" deßary said. At yesterday's meeting, the committee also discussed a second proposal to limit Humanities A texts to 18th-century works. However, no consensus was reached on the issue among committee members. Other committee members said that the introduction of modern textswould help students relate the past to the present and help them understand society's evolution.. Reading contemporary works if essential in helping students crystallize their own ideas about modern issues, according to Assistant Professor of Political Science Harvey Goldman. However, other committee members said that the addition of post-18th-century books is unnecessary since modern themes are always discussed in the context of the assigned texts, whether they are an-cient Greek classics or Shakespearean plays. Adding texts would disrupt the pace of the course and increase students' workloads, they asserted. Committee members also said that modern and non-Western texts will be used in other required courses—the courses used to satisfy the major cultures requirement or any other classes added to the core. Associate Professor of East Asian Language of Culture Paul Anderer said the committee should not evaluate proposals on the future of the humanities courses until it has considered the problem of finding faculty who are willing and qualified to teach them. ""Our highest priority should be to change the existing structure [of how the core courses are taught],"" Anderer said. Deßary agreed that the faculty shortage problem is a main consideration, adding that anongoing committee should be established to review the core. ""I'm very strongly in favor of establishing a standing committee to evaluate the core, not just every year, but continuously,"" he said. ""The committee should reevaluate programs and different aspects of the curriculum and make proposals for new courses and test them on an experimental basis."" ""We need a mechanism that will represent the college faculty and students and will take a look at the overall direction and scope of core courses that won't regard courses as sacrosanct or fixed,"" he added. The committee will continue to meet weekly, with the rest of the month devoted to the Literature Humanities question. Members will meet with the Humanities faculty later this month."
271,Lit Hum remains open to modern texts,14 October 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalThe committee reviewing the future of the Columbia College core curriculum decided yesterday to give instructors teaching Literature Humanities the option of ending the course with 18th Century texts since no consensus could be reached by committee members. ""It is not a major change. What we're saying is that we would allow professors to limit Humanities A [Lit Hum] to the 18th Century or before, but not mandate that. Other instructors can include texts from the 19th or 20th Century if they choose to do so,"" said Commission Chair Wm. Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University. Many commission members have said that including modern texts in the course is essential for helping students relate the past to the present and formulate ideas about modern issues. However, other committee members argued that the addition of post-18th Century books is not necessary since modern themes arealways discussed in the context of the assigned texts. Adding texts would disrupt the pace of the course, these professors argued. Committee members said another reason they did not make a final decision on the proposal was because they did not want to stifle future re-evaluation of the core. Committee members agreed there is a need for an ongoing committee that will review the curriculum frequently and make proposals for new additions to the core. ""We need a mechanism that willrepresent the college faculty and students and will look at the overall direction and scope of core courses and won't regard courses as sacrosanct or fixed,"" deßary said last week. Committee members also decided that the instructional format of the course should be maintained, and that the addition of optional guest lectures on course material would give students an extra viewpoint on the texts. However, they could not find a solution to finding staff members who are willing and able to teach the course. ""People just teach a course [fora few years] and then get rotated out of the system just when they're beginning to unerstand and teach the material. Part of the problem in keeping professors in the program,"" deßary said last week. The inexperience of the junior faculty in teaching Literature Humanities is the key problem, according to a draft proposal written by Robert Belknap, professor of Slavic Languages. Belknap suggested creating a six-year fellowship for preceptors in which they wouldteach Humanities courses and eventually become regular assistant professors, with a full salary and teaching load, in the department of their fields of study. The fellowship could also include a year-long leave for the preceptors to search for jobs either at Columbia or at other institutions. Committee members argued, however, that there is no incentive for graduate students to remain in such a long-term program since one or two years of experience is just as good for their resumes, and that preceptors are not accorded enough respect as members of the teaching staff. However, deßary said, ""graduate students are an essential part of the mix of instructors."" He added, ""Our job is to enhance the position of the preceptors and provide appropriate rewards for their services, which are highly valuable."" But finding older faculty members to teach the courses is stil a pressing problem, he added. Deßary said this issue will be discussed extensively at future meetings, since it is one of the most critical problems facing the core."
272,Letters,6 December 1990,"BOM defended To the Editor: While the Board of Managers (BOM) respects the right of Spectator's editorial staff to criticize our programming, its editorial (""Better BOM,"" Dec. 3) contained numerous errors about BOM's structure and operation First, there were some factual errors. There are nine people on the board, not six, as you stated: a four member executive committee and five committee heads. We are funded by the Joint Budgetary and Calendaring Committee directly from student activities fees, not from the Columbia College Student Council's funds. We also have co-sponsored numerous events with other campus events, including the Queen Latifah concert, co-sponsored by, among others, the Black Students Organization, the Lesbian Bisexual and Gay Coalition (LBGC), the United Minorities Board, Earl Hall and the Columbia College Women's Center, and a forthcoming screening of the film ""Longtime Companion,"" co-sponsored with LBGC. We hold a general meeting for all interested students every September, but these meetings are poorly attended, despite our highly visible events. More distressingly, your editorial reflected a fundamental misunderstanding about BOM's structure. BOM consists of several largely autonomous committees, united under a common funding mechanism. BOM does not control the programming decisions of the committees that comprise it. The committees make every effort to gauge student interest in their events. Since committees rely almost exclusively on box-office receipts to make ends meet, good attendance is vital. If people are not interested in our programming, how is it possible that so many of our films, Comedy Cabarets and concerts are so well-attended? We feel that we are very accountable to student interests. We are always open to students' suggestions (put them in our mailbox outside 206 FBH, or call us at x 43600). Anyone who is interested and willing to put in some work is welcome to join a committee. We have over 100 active committee members at this time. BOM is a democratic organization: executive committee members are elected in a general meeting, and committee officers are elected each year by the committees. Anyone who is unhappy with BOM's programming can join a committee at any time and can have a say in it. Since you brought it up, we will answer the more specific comments about the Professor Griff/Maya Angelou controversy. As a reaction to widespread protests about Professor Griff, the previous board responded to student feelings by withdrawing their funds, but there is no point in arguing about these events now. Those decisions were not made by the current board. There is interest in the A 1 Sharpton lecture, from both his supporters and his detractors. We hope people will come to hear what he has to say, even though they may not agree with his views. We should reserve judgment until we have heard the man out. The purpose of the BOM Lectures Committee is to schedule interesting, even controversial, lectures by public figures. The committee's budget for the 1990-91 year is roughly $12,000, and the Sharpton/Maddox lecture is only a small portion of this budget. Even if it was possible to bring only safe, noncontroversial speakers, we would not attract the interest of the student body, and no one would come to our lectures. The Board of Managers: Andrew Katz, CC '9O/SEAS '9l, Jill Weissman, BC '9l, David J. Lidsky, CC '9l, liana Porat, CC '9l, Vanessa Cole, SEAS '9l, Jed Meyer, CC '92, Richard Rosivach, CC '9l, Steve Taub, SEAS '9l, Cynthia Young, CC '9l Speaker mocks CU To the Editor: Who is Minister Dr. Khallid Abdul Muhammad? What weight should we give to his opinions, or to his insulting and painful rhetoric (""Jewniversity"")? The article on his talk in the Dec. 3 issue of Spectator runs a photo provided by man and quotes his poster verbatim in describing him as ""a recipient of the Ford Foundation Fellowship to study atColumbia, Harvard and Yale."" Did Spectator look into these claims, try to discover the origin of his ""doctorate,"" or in any other way attempt any independent journalism here? It does not seem so. Setting Spectator's laziness aside, the difficulty this person presents our University is not reduced by his credentials, whatever they may be. A group of our students invited him, and paid him, to make these statements to us all. If they were reported accurately, they insulted us all, mocking our University and all of its citizens. What do my colleagues have to say in response? Shall we let it go by a ""Black event,"" thereby passing back the insult implicit in any summary judgment of a group by its skin color, and presuming on the opinions of an important section of our student body? Not me. This person had every right to speak, and I have every right to condemn his hurtful, erroneous, inflammatory words. And I do. Who—of any race or religion—will join me? Robert Pollack, CC '6l Professor of Biological Sciences Dean Emeritus, Columbia College Sticks and stones... To the Editor: I have an idea. As a white, Jewish American I'll just stand in the middle of a circle comprising Professor Griff, Lisa Williamson, Khallid Abdul Muhammad and assorted members of the Black Students Organization and let them all hurl large stones at me. From recent events and statements made on this campus, I gather this will be a good cheap method of making these people feel good. Rachel Stoll, CC '92 Attack all bigotry To the Editor: It is disheartening to read of yet another campus speaker who had addressed this community with a message of hatred, prejudice and intolerance. Racial bigotry must be deplored whenever it occurs, regardless of the source or the target. Khallid Abdul Muhammad's references to ""Columbia Jewniversity"" in ""Jew York City"" and his other disparaging remarks about non-blacks are distasteful to all those who promote tolerance and mutual respect. Beyond our outrage at this specific incident, however, lies a greater issue. Muhammad is just one of the several speakers recently invited by the Black Students Organization (BSO) who have fostered this ideology of prejudice and hatred. If it is the intent of the BSO to send the Columbia community a message other than one of intolerance towards non-blacks, their message is unclear. The deprecation of any group of people as a means to assert oneself is intolerable. Of course, we acknowledge that speakers invited to campus do not necessarily reflect the views of the organizations that sponsor them. However, the BSO's refusal to publicly disassociate itself from the hate-filled statements by its speakers leads us to the conclusion that, at best, the organization is indifferent to the vilification of others. If our goal is an atmosphere of tolerance and respect in which we may address issues of concern, we must separate our legitimate grievances from rhetoric of hatred. Executive Board of the Jewish Student Union: Tracie Beberman, GS/JTS '92, Joshua Leibowitz, CC '9l, Stephanie Newman, BC '9l, Saul Richter, CC '92, Rob Scheinberg, CC '9l, Joel Wine, CC '9l, Mary Zamore, CC '9l Teach civic values To the Editor: I am writing in reference to the article describing the address by Khallid Abdul. What bothered me so about this article was what one Barnard student is reported to have said in response to the speech:' 'Muhammad's beliefs are very enlightening and clarifies [sic] many questions that black students and future scholars need to address and define in order to full 'know thyself."" I am disappointed that a young person who is bright enough to attend Barnard College isso disaffected with American society that she can find enlightenment in the miscellaneous ramblings of this self-confessed anti-Ameri-can revolutionary? Enlightenment? This is a man who is able to use the phrase ""Columbia Jewniversity"" and, at the same time, assert neither that he is an anti-Semite or that he knows any Jews on campus who should be angry with him. However, I will not dwell on his anti-Semitism. His self-denial cloaks far more hatred and mistrust than even his pejorative comments reveal. I focus my thoughts primarily on his belief that ""blacks cannot consider themselves American because they have never reaped the benefits of being American."" The mere fact that he is able to make such statements in public and receive applause rather than censure is the greatest testament to the benefits that all Americans receive regardless of race, gender or ethnicity. If the Barnard student who was quoted finds enlightenment in this statement, then we as a society have failed her. Through a primary and secondary educational system that fears traditional values more than it fears anarchy and revolution, we have failed to provide her with the ideals upon which this nation was founded. Through a higher education system in which it is far easier to find courses that teach Marxism than courses that teach civic responsibility, we have failed to provide an environment in which students are challenged to heed John F. Kennedy's advice. I do not blame Muhammad for this student's disaffection. I blame an educational system that has retreated from the values which once bound us as a nation and left a void in the hearts and minds of our young people. As long as we allow this vacuum to persist, something will come along to fill it. If it is not the ideas of Muhammad, then it will be something else, perhaps worse. How long can we allow this to continue? Barry Sugarman Ph.D. candidate, Teachers College Aft'. ' i Don't jump the gun To the Editor: In the recent article ""NRA supporters blast gun control and call it a failed idea'' (Nov. 15) you report on a panel discussion sponsored by the College Republicans with speakers from the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and New York Court Officials. The article is filled with quotes by NRA representative Kevin Starell, including: ""gun control is morally repugnant and practically unworkable,"" and ""if you look at the statistics, guns in the hands of honest people do protect the people who are using them."" By printing such rhetoric without including an alternate point of view, Spectator is guilty of bias by omission and is committing a serious disservice to its readers. A minimum of research, by either your staff or any rational person, would reveal very different statistics. The United States has perhaps the weakest handgun control laws of any other Western industrialized nation. As a result, it has grossly disproportionate number of handgun homicides. In 1988, 8915 people were murdered by handguns in the United States. In Canada, the number was eight, and in Britain the number was seven. This is contrary to what the NRA and Starell maintain-that weak gun laws protect us by allowing us to arm ourselves. Starell further tries to persuade us that a seven-day mandatory waiting period for the purchase of a handgun is useless, because a standard FBI fingerprint check takes 22 days. He purposely ignores the fact that the purpose of the waiting period is not to match fingerprints, but to check for such things as previous felony convictions. In 1989, Maryland stopped over 1500 dangerous handgun sales by effectively employing a seven-day waiting period. Having a waiting period to purchase a lethal weapon also makes good common sense, since most murders are impulsive acts. Rather than eliminating the waiting period, as Starell suggests, we should adopt a longer, nationwide waiting period. There are numerous statistics that argue for the need for stronger gun control. Every year, over 1200 Americans are accidentally shot with a handgun. Ten children are killed every day in this country by handguns. Every threehours an American teenager commits suicide with a handgun. Starell claims, ""Usually people who are opposed to guns don't know anything about guns."" I fired my first gun at age 14 at a Boy Scout shooting competition. This is different. Handguns are made to kill people. If you need proof, I invite you to come up to my neighborhood in Washington Heights, or visit me where I sometimes work, in the Emergency Room of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. If you are too busy to make the trip, at least become informed. Two alternate sources of information are the NRA (800-368-5714) and Handgun Control (202-898-0792) Compare the data and reach your own conclusion. I did. Emil Chynn College of Physicians & Surgeons, '92 CCSC fails to do job To the Editor: I'm writing this to express the frustration and anger that I felt when I read the articles ""Council says CU should not build biomed. center"" and ""CU should seek alternative Audubon plan"" (Spectator, Nov. 29). The articles clearly demonstrate the self-patroniz-ing liberal for the sake of being liberal attitude which, unfortunately, is the mark of the Columbia College Student Council (CCSC). The council is supposed to represent the interests of the students but it falls short of doing so on this issue. Crump states that the plans to build the biomedical center at the proposed site is ""environmentally unsound, clearly profit motivated, and smacks of racism."" It seems that it is the minds of CCSC officials and the so-called resolution which is ""unsound,"" ' 'clearly motivated'' b> few radical activists (and then the rest of tie council mindlessly jumped on the ""liberal bandwagon""). The resolution as presented in Crump's article ""smacks"" of yellow journalism. The biomedical research center would not be some horrible monster spewing harmful biological waste into the land, water or air as the CCSC would have us believe. The environmental impact of the research center has been studied extensively and does not pose a threat to the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness for all involved. Rather, the building's present deplorable condition, besides being an eye sore, is actually a health and fire hazard. Crump also cries ""every community has the right to self determination."" Since when has this been a ""right,"" and if it is then what about the right of Columbia (which is a sizable member of that community) to determine what it wants to do with what is their property? The research center would also create many jobs for the people who live in the neighborhood and would increase business in the local stores and restaurants. In general it would give quite a boost to the Washington Heights economy, which it can use. The research that would take place at the biomedical center could produce unimaginably beneficial findings that would not only help the residents of both the Washington Heights and Columbia communities, but the entire world. If the center is not built, it will be a tragic loss for the world community. The reasons for the passing of this resolution are, at best illegitimate. The council has made issues out of non-issues, created certain ""inalienable"" rights out of non-issues, created certain ""inalienable"" rights of a community and then selectively and prejudicially applied these rights in favor of their point of view, and used some less than ethical journalistic techniques to paint a grossly distorted image of the biomedical center. Finally, council members have failed to represent the students at Columbia. To have completely misrepresented the views of the group of students who feel the same way I do (and mind you, we are not the small minority that the CCSC incorrectly believes us to be) is simply inexcusable, and I suggest that the council reconsider their actions. In the future when making such ""resolutions"" and using what limited powers it has, the council should do so in a more appropriate and responsible manner in which they are truly representative. Steven M. Fried, SEAS '92Learn your pronouns To the Editor: Nancy Coffin's Nov. 12 letter contained lies which were slanderous to me. To clear up matters, people must know what happened: Ms. Coffin was the representative at the Arab Association's table on Clubs Day. I spoke with her extensively about a proposal by Student Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (SOJAC): The Arab Association and SOJAC should cosponsor cultural events. It seemed that by coming together to emphasize similarities, the two groups could reduce Arab-Jewish tensions. The first SOJAC cultural event was ""Sounds of the Jewish High Holy Days in Arab Lands."" SOJAC hoped the Arab Association would cosponsor. Ms. Coffin encouraged me to attend the first Arab Association meeting. Unfortunately, it was on Rosh Hashana; so I was unable to go. I thus wrote up SOJAC's proposal, and Ms. Coffin took it to present to the Arab Association. A few days later, Ms. Coffin called me.' 'They didn't want to do it,"" she said. One reason she gave was that ""singing Jewish songs to Arab tunes is taking possession of the Arab culture."" Of course, this display of culture imperialism could not be tolerated. I thus wrote my original letter to Spectator (Oct. 15). The week my letter appeared, two members of the Arab Association approached me. They stated that in fact, association members never said they would not cosponsor SOJAC's event. On Nov. 12, two months after I spoke with Ms. Coffin, Ms. Coffin wrote an' 'open letter'' to me, via the paper. In this letter, she finally admitted that in fact, the Arab Association never did discuss my letter. In addition, she insinuated that I knew this information all along: ""Your taking my words out of context and misrepresenting my statement as official Arab Association policy seems to me to be a blatant attempt to defame the Association."" Tell me, Ms. Coffin: Do you always refer to yourself as ' 'They?"" I will not speculate on Ms. Coffin's motives for her behavior. I certainly hope this incident boils down to a poor choice in pronouns. Whether or not it does, people should realize that it is the doing of one individual, not of the Arab Association itself. Along this line, the SOJAC board and I are relieved to know that the Arab Assocation in fact did not reject SOJAC's proposal or make the mentioned slur. We look forward to joining together on future events. Loolwa Khazzoom, BC'9l founder/chair, SOJAC BBH not into building To the Editor: Your very fine article about the proposed Center for Jewish Life (Spectator, Nov. 1) contained an important factual error. You incorrectly stated that 30 percent of the funds needed for the project will be contributed by B'nai B'rith Hillel/Jewish Association for College Youth (BBH/JACY). That is not the case. Funding for the project has been assumed by the Jewish Campus Life Fund, Inc., the Columbia alumni foundation that sponsors Jewish activities on campus. Since 1929 the fund has been responsible for the staff and program of the Jewish Office at Columbia. In recent years, BBH/JACY has become a wonderful partner with the Fund and has provided 30 percent of the resources needed for the Jewish Office staff and the Jewish Student Union program. BBH/JACY has not assumed a 30 percent responsibility for the projected Center for Jewish Life. Rabbi Charles Sheer Geographism too To the Editor: While applauding Spectator on its stand against sexism, homophobia, racism, and even classism, I must also voice my concern about an equally vicious ""ism"" of which Spectator itself is often guilty: ""geographism."" Geographists seem to collect at pretentious Ivy League institutions, earning their title by belittling those from what the geographists conside to be ""lesser"" areas of thecountry. Among graduate students, geographists also tow the elitist line, by deriding those who did not attend private undergraduate universities. While the cartoon ""Absurdity of Life"" in the Nov. 16 issue sought to comment on the important issue of sexist language, it promoted geographist views by mocking my own hometown of Tucson, Arizona. Of course, being open minded, I can understand why someone in New York would think that' 'eating hot dogs and enjoying baseball in Tuscon [sic], Arizona"" has less social value than sitting at a trendy bar clothed in black, sipping mineral water, and discussing ""politically correct"" issues while the homeless stand outside in the cold. But, then again, while Tucson does have trendy bars, a few people who wear only black (undertakers and priests), and perhaps one person who buys Evian (a former New Yorker), Tucsonans don't have to exalt themselves by mocking other areas. Further, instead of watching life, we live it, and because of the excellent climate, nobody is left in the cold. Brian Fortman Columbia Law School '9l Salute to Ceresney To the Editor: I am writing to you so that I may publicly applaud the actions of Columbia College Representative-at-Large Andrew Ceresney, CC '93, who recently voted against a CCSC resolution opposing the construction of the new biomedical research facility. My praise however, has nothing to do with the facility itsef. In his three semesters on the Student Council, Ceresney has refused to fall victim to the ""Politically Correct"" mentality which enslaves such a large portion of this campus. While other student-politicians feel the need to cater to special interest groups in order to preserve their image as being ""PC,"" Ceresney has consistently been true to his beliefs and the beliefs of his constituents. Contrary to popular belief, this campus is not a homogeneous political community. There are many students who do not readily subscribe to the liberally-biased conventional wisdom which has dominated Columbia for the past several decades. Unfortunately, these students are frequently written off as either racist or insensitive; rarely are their voices heard. Rather than subscribe to the conventional wisdom, Ceresney has placed himself above the frequently depressing state of Columbia College politics. Ceresney understands that there are many Columbia students concerned with practical solutions to our community's problems and that these solutions need not be ideologically based. Ceresney has and will continue to provide effective, responsible and accurate representation for the many Columbia students more concerned with solutions than politics. For that, I salute and thank Andrew. Erik Tischler, CC '92 Core's essence is change To the Editor: Once again, I feel I must take issue with some of the misconceptions that are expressed about Columbia College's Core Curriculum. In your editorial of Nov. 20, you commend Asian Americans Working for Education (AAWE) for its efforts to place a course in Asian American studies on Barnard's curriculum. Specifically, you praise them for ""chipping at the core"" (the editorial's title), implying that Asian American studies represent something necessarily ""other"" than the traditional Core Curriculum. What is also implicit in this statement of congratulations is the entirely false notion that the Core Curriculum represents an unchanging monolith—a stodgy and inflexible tradition—that needs to be chipped at. Nothing, in fact, is farther from the truth. What is remarkable about the Core Curriculum is exactly its tradition of change. Very little of the syllabus of today's Contemporary Civilization is similar to the first version of the course offered in the 1919-20 academic year. Indeed, in the words of Professor Justus Buchler, Contem-porary Civilization ""was literally born revising itself.'' Since 1919, countless changes have been made in the Contemporary Civilization course as well as the other courses in the Core Curriculum. Indeed, we do not even take a second year of CC, as Columbia College students did from 1929 until 1960. The establishment of the Extended Core in 1988 was only the most recent in a series of changes that have kept the Core Curriculum up-to-date and thus vital. Change in the Core Curriculum is undoubtedly a good thing—it is what preserves the original intent of the fathers (yes, they were all men) of the Core. Change means that the Core will always attempt to teach Columbia College students how to understand the culture in which they live. The second misconception in the editorial is the idea that there is a connection between the names of the authors on the facade of Butler Library and the Core Curriculum (specifically, Literature Humanities): ""changing an established curriculum at Columbia can seem as laborious as chipping another set of names onto the facade of Butler Library."" This connection is entirely specious. Butler Library was built in 1934, fully three years before Literature Humanities was established as ""Humanities A"" in 1937. Certainly, both the Butler facade and the Lit. Hum. course make overt references to the canon of works by the ""great authors,"" but any relationship between the two Columbia institutions is purely coincidental. The errors I have indicated are by no means major, and do not significantly alter the main point of the editorial. Still, I feel compelled to correct them because I believe that my corrections will go a long way in clarifying the ever-present and ever-heated argument over the merits of the Core Curriculum. Misconceptions such as the idea that the Core is an entrenched and unyielding fixture at Columbia only cloud the issue and prevent rational debate on the subject. David Kaufman, CC '9l (The author recently wrote a lengthy monograph on the origins of the Core Curriculum at Columbia College for the National Endowment for the Humanities and wishes to point out that he is one-half Asian by descent.) Soul search at Spec? To the Editor: Historically, Jews have found that misdirected and misunderstood knowledge can yield tragedy. We need not cite more than the burning of the Talmud in France and the Nachmanides Debate, events triggered by Jewish converts to Christianity. While I would not place Laura Shaw in such a category, I would like to comment that as a religious Jew, I was quite offended by her piece of Nov. 26, ""Jewish Women Hear Muffled Voice."" My gripe is not directed at her feminism, nor towards her feelings. The search for a religious self and identity is a difficult one. It is not a unique or new one, but, it is also not a discussion fit for the pages of the Spectator (no disrespect to the publication intended). Shaw says she is religious, and while arguably she does not mean Orthodox, her textual proofs certainly show such a bias. Yet, she speaks of a male viewpoint in the writing of the Torah, a view that is meaningless to 3500 years of belief that Moses was only God's pen. Furthermore, she cites Midrash, or legend. While these texts do exist, there exists a large rift among scholars as to how these legends apply to everyday life. Finally, she cites the Amidah, the Silent Devotion, as a masculine chronological tool to mention the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. If Shaw understood this prayer properly, she would realize it is not chronological at all. It is merely a tool used to highlight the different attributes of God exemplified by these individuals. Her own invented prayer therefore need not be chronological. There is a time and place for religious soul searching. It is a task that minimally be undertaken with guidance and accompaniment from more knowledgeable scholars. It certainly does not belong as a single misguided voice on the pages of the Spectator. Joseph Wolf, SEAS '92Campaign corrections To the Editor: Because one article and an editorial contain factual errors about the status of the New Campaign for Columbia, I respectfully ask that you print this letter in its entirety. First, the New Campaign goal is $1.15 billion, not $1.5 billion, as you reported in Monday' s edition. Second, the pledge balance of the University is $l2O, not $l2 million as you reported in the same paper. Third, in you editorial of Nov. 14, you stated that the $330 million raised since 1988 does not represent funds that have been raised under the current campaign, and that Mr. Kluge's gift is the only money collected under the current campaign. Both statements are incorrect. Kluge's gift of $25 million is included in the $330 million total, and every penny of the $330 million is included in the current Campaigning total raised to date. Peter McE. Buchanan Former Vice President for University Development and Alumni Relations Nat'l guard not militia To the Editor: I am writing in response to a letter from Peter C. Richter (Spectator Letters Nov. 27) concerning his support of gun control and interpretation of the second amendment. First I will mention that it is quite obvious from your letter that you did not actually attend the presentation itself. The second amendment was extensively dealt with by the speakers, including the ""well-regulated militia"" phrase you claim the gun lobby fails to acknowledge. As a law graduate you must know that the Bill of Rights was put in the Constitution to protect the people from the government. Therefore, the militia of the authors of the Bill of Rights cannot be part of the government. Please read Perpich v. Department of Defense, a U.S. Supreme Court decision from June 1990. The Court held that the National Guard is not the Constitutional militia, since it is funded by the national government and always subject to the president's orders. Even current Federal law follows the Founder's definition of a people's militia (Militia Act 1792). Please read Title 10 U.S. Code section 311. A ""well-regulated Militia"" is not the National Guard as you assumed. The fact that the Founding Fathers did intend the second amendment to also protect the right of personal self-defense, is obvious from the debates in the U.S. Senate on Sept. 9, 1789 when they refused a motion to add the phrase ""for the common defense"" after the phrase ' 'to keep and bear arms"" in the second amendment. Please don't believe what I or anyone else would tell you on this subject. You are fortunate enough to be attending a university which has excellent libraries and research centers available to you. I'm sure you are aware of this since you are in the School of Library Service. Do your own research, and discover the facts for yourself. Glen Morgan, CC '93 Chair, College Republicans at Columbia Stones not the issue To the Editor: One minor note on Jonathan Sopher's editorial: when Einstein said that the next war would be fought with stone, he meant to warn that the use of nuclear weapons (in WWII) would put us back in the Stone Age. The effectiveness of stones as weapons was not at all the issue. In a more serious vein, before condemning either side in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, consider something closer to home. How would you react if the Native Americans who lived in your home town less than 500 (not 1500) years ago, came back and demanded that you make space for them and follow their system of government. No matter how good the Israelis claim to the land may be, I cannot fault the Palestinians for resenting the intrusion. Methods on both sides are a different question entirely, and one I am not qualified to discuss. Jennifer Broekman, CC '93"
273,Avery given grant for catalogue,10 July 1991,"By Elena CabralSpectator Summer BoardThe Andrew Mellon Foundation recently awarded the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library a $46,000 grant to complete work on anew computerized catalogue of its drawing collections. The computerized catalogue will incorporate over 40,000 images of the library's architectural drawings on videodiscs which can be accessed and displayed on a screen, according to Janet Parks, the library's curator of drawings and project supervisor. The catalogue will be implemented into the Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) anational and international bibliographic system currently used by major research institutions. RLIN contains cataloging records for over 41 million books, serials, maps and manuscripts on all subjects. Researchers use the system as an inter-library loan system with electronic mail requests. The new system will also provide remote access to drawings from locations throughout the country, Parks added. ""Communication will be made a lot easier,"" she said. Other RLIN users who will have access to the Avery collections include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, Yale and Cornell universities, and Dartmouth College.The project, called AVIADOR, is designed to enhance the availability of the library's collections, which feature mostly 19th and 20th century American works. AVIADOR stands for the Averyvideodisc index of architectural drawings on RLIN. Avery, founded in 1890, contains the largest architectural collections of books, periodicals and rare manuscripts in the western hemisphere and is used by scholars from all over the world, Parks said. ""We are sort of a de facto national library of architecture,"" she said. The video catalogue will also help to preserve the drawings, the oldest of which date back to the 16th century. Over 100 staff members and students have been involved in the project, which began in 1984. The project is the first to use new national standards for cataloging visual materials, which were issued by the Library of Congress as a supplement to the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules. The recent Mellon grant is part of a series of contributions from the foundation and from the National Endowment for the Humanities. A test model of the system will be in place in Avery this fall, according to Parks.SPECTATOR/ALLISON COOPERMAN The Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, picured here, houses a collection of over 200,000 architectural drawings, 40,000 of which will be catalogued in a new computer system this fall."
274,Spectrum Alphabetical conspiracy in L&R,14 October 1992,"Alphabetical conspiracy in L&RMan the barricades, seize Low Library, put on your black clothes, and call the ISO. I have discovered a conspiracy on campus, engineered and executed by the administration itself. A conspiracy that affects an entire half of our student body. A conspiracy that permeates the very fabric of our college life and that has terrifying repercussions that resound through the rest of our careers.I speak, of course, of the conspiracy to shove those CC and SEAS first-years with last names that fall into the second half of the alphabetical rolls into second semester Logic and Rhetoric. Blatant discrimination. Remember, we need Logic and Rhetoric in order to write effectively on a college level. I know this. My faculty adviser told me so. Without Logic and Rhetoric, we would be unable to correctly split an infinitive, much less hand in a 10 page research paper, with footnotes. Before Logic and Rhetoric, we are unable to grasp the concept of college-level writing, much less structure a sentence with any more grace than most of our elected public officials. If this is true, then a passing grade in Logic and Rhetoric is a necessity for further college work. Certainly this would be true for a class like Literature and Humanities, where one is graded on essay tests, papers, and perhaps short quizzes, all of which depend on a student's skill at explicating material through the written word. Yet fully 40 percent of Literature and Humanities ""A"" students are firstyears whose names start with letters from the second half of the alphabet. Such students cannot be expected to compete fairly with those students who have already taken, or are taking concurrently, Logic and Rheto-ric. Of course, since how one performs in one's first semester at college will set a precedent for any future academic work, these students are handicapped for life by this discriminatory policy. One might ask how such discrimination became so firmly rooted in one of the basic requirements of this college. I think one need look no farther than the Office of the Dean of Students to find one's answer. There, under the direct instruction of Dean Greenberg, sit Deans Balmer, Geisler and Blank. The connection is obvious—all of them with names in the front half of the alphabetical listing! We can only assume that Dean Wiggins is kept out of the loop. His real name is probably ""Anderson"" anyway. These conspirators need not even know that they are taking part in the conspiracy to abet it. They have all obviously benefited from such dis-criminatory policies in the past and so are willing to continue down this unjust course. By virtue of their last names alone they are guilty. And their conspiring policies are overlooked by this University, whose own name, you will notice, begins with the third letter of the alphabet! And do not think that this is a minor conspiracy. If needed, I could find out the correlation between first-semester Lit Hum grads and Logic and Rhetoric enrollment. But that would be research, and now is not the time for research. Now is the time for action! I propose that we act as all concerned Columbia citizens do and hold a rally on Low Library steps. This will make the entire University aware of our cause. We will needAndrew Jorgensen is a Columbia College junior.such publicity if we are going to compete with all the other outrages currently popular on campus. Once on the steps, we inch our way upwards until Michael Sovern's receptionist is bringing us coffee. Then, when we make the front pages of the Spectator and The New York Times, we issue our demands to the world. I suggest that we think our demands through carefully. There is nothing to gain by alienating or offending any portion of the Columbia community. However, that does not mean that we should mollycoddle around while we have the administration on its knees. After all, moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue. First, we should demand automatic grade clemency for any student whose name starts with a letterafter ""L."" In fact, we should also demand automatic clemency for any student who was in the second half, alphabetically, of the group that took Logic and Rhetoric first semester. They had to deal with the added stress of waiting a longer time for their instructor to call their name during the daily roll and are due reparations. Further, from now on, all students whose name came late in the alphabet should automatically have his or her grades raised to at least a B average each semester, to rectify past discrimination. Anyone whose name starts with an ""X,"" ""Y,"" or ""Z"" should get an automatic 4.0. I also propose that Professors Zetzel, Zindler, and Zubay be given automatic tenure. And Professor Zuckerman should be made University president.Shadow Boxing Andrew Jorgensen"
275,Students are missing out,19 February 1993,"By Nick ChremosColumbia is a mediocre college and not a great one. A great college develops an individual's understanding of two broad subject areas: the sciences and the humanities. A mediocre college, on the other hand, develops only one without sufficiently developing the other. Columbia, unfortunately, easily falls under the definition of a mediocre college, because it stresses the humanities while virtually ignoring the sciences. As a liberal arts and sciences university, Columbia should be committed to teaching both and ignoring neither. Its introductory sciences curriculum, however is less than adequate and demands much improvement. A quick perusal of Columbia's basic sciences requirement reveals that it is only a token requirement and not a serious one. After all, many of the courses that satisfy the requirement, such as anthropology and molecular and cellular biology, are not even fundamental sciences; rather, they are advanced science courses that are taught on an unjustifiably simple and unchallenginglevel simply to help students meet their basic science requirements. The purpose of these classes, therefore, is to provide students with a basic understanding of science requirements without demanding them to exert themselves. This arrangement damages the University's reputation and ultimately undermines the quality of the curriculum for two principal reasons. First, it encourages students who have had bad experiences with high school science to remain ignorant about scientific methods of inquiry. They take the simplest science courses and thereby receive a smattering of knowledge about the problems scientists seek to solve and the ways in which them. As an ultimate consequence, these students will never know if science interests them, because they graduate without having taken a course in a fundamental science, such as chemistry or physics. Secondly, these watered-down advanced courses drain theUniversity's financial and human resources. Each course prevents the professor from teaching more sections of the fundamental science classes and thus forces the University to offer larger sections of basic, introductory classes such as general chemistry and intensive physics. Those students who are genuinely interested in science, therefore, pay the penalty for the University's lax curriculum requirements, because they must endure large classes which often contain more than 300 people. The University can improve its basic science curriculum by slashing the number of courses that satisfy the science requirement to four alternatives: general chemistry, intensive organic chem-istry, intensive physics, and general physics (with calculus). These courses should be of comparable size to most core classes, enrolling no more than 20 students. Obviously, there would be a need to offer many sections of the same class, which would be costly, assuming that the courses are taught by full professors. If the University hires post-doctoral and graduate students, however, the costs would be much lower, yet the science curriculum would see a vast improvement. For many years, Columbia has neglected the quality of its introductory courses in the two most fundamental sciences: chemistry and physics. Hopefully, the University administration will meet the challenge to make Columbia a great university rather than a mediocre one.Nick Chremos is a Columbia College first-year."
276,"SPECTRUM Remembering Columbia, circa 1938",22 March 1993,"Remembering Columbia, circa 1938By C. Lowell HarrissCollege Walk was a public street when I began teaching at Columbia College in 1938. Security, day and night, was never a concern. Saturday classes were common. A good lunch at the Faculty Club cost 75 cents and a man's haircut 50 cents. In social sciences and the humanities, nine or 10 hours teaching a week was the rule. The subway cost five cents. Saturday afternoons in the au-the Christmas tree and at Commencement. In the sophomore year every student took, I believe, six field trips in and around New York City, chosen from a large listand integrated, more or less, into Contemporary Civilization. The area between today's College Walk and Butler Library was a non-grass playing field, almost always in use when weather permitted, chiefly for touch football and softball. A few members of the faculty joined in the play.tumn at Baker Field were a pleasure. Freshmen all took CCA and Humanities A (now Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities) and three other courses. The top students were as good as the best anytime, anywhere. But we had more than a few who would not meet today's admission requirements. It would be presumptuous to compare students, then with their counterparts today. You have equipment for study and recreation that put you in a world very different from theirs. .The vast expansion of knowledge has enlarged opportunity beyond measure. How do financial pressures compare? The dollar magnitudesyou face larexceed those of 1938 (adjusting for general inflation), but the Great Depression was still pervasive. The early New Deal recovery turned into a deep, deeply discouraging, reversal in 1938, and the outlook was poor. Nicholas Murray Butler was President. Frequently around 9 a.m. one would sec him walking up the steps of Low Library. He spoke with beautiful fluency at the lighting ofCollege enrollment has doubled since 1938, and administrative staff has grown at a far higher rate. I cannot presume to compare the services to students today with those of 1938.1 do remember well the dean standing behind his desk with the door open, facing the Hamilton Hall entrance, at various hours during the week. Anyone was welcome. My interest in public affairs brought me into contact with students with similar interests. The most articulate were left-wing. A few were very ""left,"" and their words, printed and spoken, got public attention and were, I fear, widely assumed to represent the whole Columbia community. I enjoyed matching wits, but often haddifficulty avoiding the loss of patience. In 1993 we know far more about the evils of dictatorships than one could 55 years ago. There was then not only toleration of Communism but articulate support. Some on Morningside favored Franco over his opposition (which we now know to have been directed from Moscow). Mussolini's Italy undoubt-edly had supporters, but I remember no campus defense. There was certainly no good word for Hitler, but Stalin and Communism had their advocates. And Marxists, occasionally with missionary zeal, appeared frequently. A college group today would include what was missing then: persons who could and would speak intelligently for freedom, including the economics of free markets. World War II was approaching. What were opinions on the campus? My memory is not reliable enough to warrant generalization about the relative importance of various sets of opinions. But after Hitler and Stalin made their pact in August 1939, the ""left-wingers"" repeatedly and vociferously opposed aid to Britain. Somewhere among my unorganized papers I have many of the handbills of that era. Their message, I believe, was not that Hitler deserved support but that Britain did not. Classes had ended when the Nazis attacked the Soviets in June 1941. But we saw an immediate about-face here, as everywhere the Communists tried (and tried relentlessly) to influence opinion. I recall no polls of student attitudes about the war in Europe, but views probably ranged widely until Pearl Harbor. From my first days at Columbia as a graduate student in 1935,1 felt that there should somehow be more contact between students and teaching staff. 1 wondered in 1938 and later why students so rarely accepted my open invitation to meet in office hours to get acquainted—as distinguished from meetings to deal with specific problems. But if there is one thing that has remained the same at Columbia, it is the school's fine students and faculty, persons with whom it has always been a privilege to associate.Stalin and Communism had their advocates. And Marxists, occasionally with missionary zeal, appeared frequently. A college group today would include what was missing then: persons who could and would speak intelligently for freeedom, including the freedom of market economies.C.

277,Foner receives humanities award,17 January 1995,"Professor of History Eric Foner was named last month the second annual Scholar of the Year by the New York Council for the Humanities, a state-wide group that promotes education in the humanities. Foner will receive the award, which recognizes his work on slavery and the Civil War, in a public ceremony June 5. ""The purpose of the award is to focus attention on humanities in New York State,"" Foner said. Foner is the author of several books, such as Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution. Foner is also the curator of two historical exhibits, has served as an adviser to the Public Broadcast Service's (PBS) documentary series ""The Civil War,"" and is active in improving high school history teaching methods. The award includes a $lO,OOO honorarium which Foner said he plans to use for research dealing with his current project, a book tentatively titled The Story of American Freedom, which will trace the notion of freedom in the United States since the American Revolution. Foner originally taught at Columbia from 1969 to 1972. He returned to the University in 1982 and holds the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History chair. —CHAS SISK, Spectator Staff Writer"
278,University meets goal of improving 'underutilization',2 December 1996,"By KIM VAN DUZER Spectator Staff WriterAs the University calculates this year's figures for minority and women representation in Columbia's faculty, the 1995-96 figures find the University on par with other institutions of its kind in almost every area, despite low representation of minorities and women in the natural sciences and a below-average number of women faculty members in the humanities. Assistant Provost for Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Beth Wilson said the yearly government-mandated study is conducted by comparing numbers of women and minority faculty members at Columbia withan ""expected profile"" taken from data on degrees conferred on women and minorities in the country. Through comparison of Columbia's numbers with expected profiles, the University can declare ""underutilization"" of minorities and women in specific areas, which can lead to departmental efforts to increase the number of minorities or women in their department, Wilson said. ""When underutilization is declared, as it was last year for women in the humanities, a goal is established to increase representation in that area and the departments begin intensive recruitment programs,"" Wilson said. After underutilization has been declared,Wilson said she works witii individual schools and departments to help them recruit women and minorities. ""There are often superstars who we would like to have at Columbia, and if they need the support, we try to work with them to help bring these people in,"" Wilson said. Wilson said Columbia's location in New York City is helpful in attracting female and minority academics to the University's. ""The work force here is different than somewhere else where the environment is not as diverse or the location is not as attractive,"" she said. ""These are important factors in recruitment."" Despite recruitment efforts, some areas ofinstruction, such as the natural sciences, are historically underrepresented because of the lack of minorities and women in certain fields. Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SF.AS) Zvi Galil said the school has been marginally successful in recruiting women faculty members over the past year, with two hires in 1995 and one in 1996, but agreed that recruitment has been difficult because of the lack of qualified candidates in the field. ""The trouble is that there are very few qualified candidates, especially minorities,""Galil said. ""Too few get their Ph. D.sin engineering."" Galil said the school made a ""very generous offer"" to an African-American candidate this year, but the candidate chose to go elsewhere. Wilson said an increased eye on diversity at the graduate school level may be a partial solution to the lack of qualified candidates in certain fields. ""If we don't have diversity in our graduate schools thenthere's no one coming out who will be qualified to teach,"" she said, suggesting that the University should try to achiever greater diversity in its graduate schools and develop relationships with other institutions to ""see who's coming off their pipelines."" ""It's a matter of being aware of what we are doing ourselves to increase the supply [of women and minorities in certain fields],"" Wilson said."
279,C olio quia May No Longer Be Offered,14 April 1999,"By NINA WILLDORF Spectator Staff WriterA 67-year-old tradition at Columbia College is being quietly buried—so quietly, in fact, that administrators are reluctant to talk about it. For many faculty, alumni, and students, the financial reasons being used to justify cutting the Colloquia—Core classes started in 1932 that inspired Literature Humanities —disrupt their notion of what Columbia's educational priorities should be, and create a sense of urgency in trying to save an academic legacy. In the words of famed Columbia College graduate David Denby, this seems to be ""just the wrong way to go."" What are Colloquia? Interdisciplinary, team-taught seminars for qualified upperclassmen, the Colloquia were intendedto be extensions of the Core, giving students the opportunity to explore topics outside of their major in their last two years at Columbia. The Colloquium on Important Books was first introduced in the College during the 1932-33 school year. The two professors teaching the course specialized in differentdisciplines and compiled a reading list with the students, often integrating such fields as English, Philosophy, History, Greek, Latin, Economics, Anthropology, and Political Science. Some of Columbia's most noted professors were the first to teach Colloquia: Jacques Barzun, Lionel Trilling, Mark Van Doren, Moses Hadas, and Raymond Weaver. After the course became more popularamongst both students and faculty, the faculty authorized an expansion of the program, creating a new required sequence: Humanities A and Humanities B (now called Literature Humanities). The Colloquia are one of the few forums at Columbia that promote inter-disciplinary studies. For many seniors who find themselves in large major-specific classes by the end of their four years, the Colloquia have been a rewarding way to round out the Columbia Core experience and reunite with classmates from other disciplines. And because they are the only classes at Columbia College where both faculty and students must apply to participate, the Colloquia provide a rare opportunity to be learning from, and with, people whowant to be there. Some colloquia that have been offered in recent years are ""Development of the Citizen and the Welfare State,"" ""Medicine and Civilization,"" ""Humanity and Human Rights,"" and ""Race and Representation: Jewish identity in Modern European Literatures."" For Justin Shubow, CC '99, who is currently enrolled in the Colloquium, the class fills a void in his philosophy major. ""There's only one seminar in my department, so I don't get a chance to take this sort of class,"" he said. And as for the opportunity to cross the boundaries between disciplines, Shubow said, ""I'm a philosophy major, but I still want to read literature."" J.C. Sylvan, CC '97, who took the Colloquium when he was a student in the College, described it as ""the best thing at Columbia for humanities students."" Students like English major Juliet Ross, CC 00, who had hoped to take a Colloquium next year, are upset at the prospect of losing the Colloquia. ""I am disappointed,"" she said. ""It would help me integrate my studies in the Core and in my major, and would give me a sense of having a more complete understanding of things. I think it will be harder to create that experience for myself without the Colloquium."" Colloquia Today From an administrative economic point of view, the Colloquia are not very cost-efficient; two professors teaching 15 students adds up to what Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen called ""an inefficient deployment of resources."" By not having its own department, the Colloquium Committee does not have a discretionary budget or departmental protection. Without its own budget, the Committee draws on money from either the dean of Columbia College or the vice president of Arts and Sciences, who is responsible for the budgetary decisions for 28 departments of instruction in five schools. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Steven Marcus, CC '49, has a unique vantage point on the issue, having been the first and only person to simultaneously be dean of Columbia College and vice president of Arts and Sciences, from 1992 to 1995. In 1995, Austin Quigley became dean, and David Cohen became vice president. In his two roles, Marcus made both the financial and academic decisions for the College. Now that the two positions are unlinked, the dean of the College does not have the same degree of budgetaryauthority or autonomy. The separation of these two roles has created the crack into which the Colloquia seem to have fallen. Since 1995, as the undergraduate community has expanded through Enlargement and Enhancement, and the Administration has restructured itself, the problems that the Colloquia are faced with have turned financial. The fear that many faculty and alumni have is that the financial reasons being used as the justification for eliminating Colloquia could be easily transferred over in the future to the Core. The fear that many students have is that economic decisions are taking precedence over educational ones. James Shapiro, professor of English and Comparative Literature and chair of the Colloquium Committee, said, ""I'm also concerned that the economic argument against funding the Colloquia could be used down the road against Core courses—which, by the same logic, are also not cost-effective. At some point educational priorities need to be recognized."" David Denby, CC '65, whose 1996 book Great Books helped bring critical acclaim to Columbia's Core Curriculum, also expressed wariness toward the administrators' use of cost-effectiveness as the criterion for academic decisions. ""In general, I'm against hurting anything that makes Columbia special on the basis of cost-efficiency,"" Denby told the Spectator. Justin Shubow said that his four years in the College have shown him that ""all this University seems to care about is money."" The Decision Makers After trying unsuccessfully to find someone in Low Library to say ""you came to the right place"" rather than ""you're talking to the wrong person,"" it became clear just how and why this program may no longer be offered. When pressed, Cohen, Provost Jonathan Cole, and Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis all admitted to having seen the issue cross their desks, but no one accepted full responsibility for a decision about the Colloquia or even affirmed that any decision had been made at all. ""We're still struggling to find out where authority comes from,"" said Professor Shapiro. Provost Cole explained that administrative authority over the Colloquia comes from three places: Vice President David Cohen makes budgetary decisions; Dean Quigley makes budgetary and academic decisions; and the Committee on Instruction (COI) makes academic decisions. Though Cole said that he reviews all budgets, he ""would not be reviewing on an annual basis proposals for courses or requests to offer courses."" He then added, ""in fact, I would have nothing to do with the Colloquia."" Though Provost Cole's role as chief academic officer entitles him to review and question all the budgets and academic plans from the individual schools, in response to a request for information about where the decision is made, he said ""I wish I couldhelp you, but,those issues just don't come across my desk."" Provost Cole handed the power of the proverbial red pen over to Vice President Cohen and Dean Quigley. ""[The issue] is clearly in the realm of the College and the Arts and Sciences."" Yet, in response to a request for an interview, Vice President Cohen, through his administrative assistant, said that he was ""the wrong person to talk to."" Only in person, confronted with the directional information that Provost Cole had provided, did Cohen admit that his budgetary decisions affected the Colloquia. The effect of those budgetary decisions clearly makes him the right person to talk to. Cohen said that no definitive decision has been made but that ""there has been a discussion."" He explained that there are two budgets, that of the Arts and Sciences and that of the College, and ""if the College wants to keep the Colloquia, it can support it out of its own budget."" He then said that if he thought the program was worth keeping, ""in principle, the money could come from Arts and Sciences."" Cohen, who during his six-year term as provost of Northwestern University nearly tripled their research budget from $59 million to $lOO million, said ""ultimately, every decision is financial."" The fundamental financial issue at hand with Colloquia is that, whereas previously, faculty who taught the Colloquia did so without reducing their teaching loads for other courses, ""now they're getting released from their other courses."" While Cohen pointed the finger at the professors for teaching fewer classes, the four professors who proposed to teach the Colloquia in the Fall of 1999 were turned away for lack of funds. Cohen, who Professor of Biology Darcy Kelley noted for his ""canny appreciation of the means to academic ends,"" pointed out that ""it's less expensive to knock Colloquia than to hire new faculty. It's a question of how does one deploy resources."" Associate Dean Kathryn Yatrakis, who is also the secretary of the Committee on Instruction (COI), said that ""the COI is continuing its discussion of the Colloquium with the Colloquium Committee."" She pointed out that the COI has been trying to negotiate between students' various interests. ""Students have been expressing two related concerns—the size of class enrollments and the number of senior professors teaching in the Core. This means that the COI and the academic departments have to make judgements about which priorities it will meet first."" Yet, without adequate funding from either Quigley or Cohen's offices, the COI doesn't have much of a decision to make. Dean Quigley did not respond to requests for interviews, nor did he comment on correspondence that was forwarded to him. Provost Cole, Vice President Cohen, and Dean Quigley ensured that Enlargement and Enhancement would not affect the quality of the College's curriculum. ""We will not permit a larger total enrollment to require changes in the College's unique curriculum, the way it is taught, or class size inthe Core,"" they pledged in a February 1996 article in the Columbia University Record. Provost Cole also affirmed that the University classifies the Colloquia as ""upper-level elective Core classes."" However, when asked how the University could cut the Colloquia after he had made the commitment above, he changed his classification, saying, ""The Colloquium is an elective, so therefore it's not really part of the required Core."" The Demise of the Colloquia During their 67-year tenure at Columbia College, the Colloquia have gone through a number of transitional phases. Professor Marcus has observed the Colloquia over the past five decades and commented that in its early years, it was ""not just a course, it was at a very high level with some of the very best faculty teaching it."" He pointed out that ""for a couple of decades in the '6os and 70s, the Colloquia was not staffed in the best way. There was a certain decline because the faculty who were either volunteering or chosen were not as enthusiastic or as committed as faculty in the past have been. This is a historical part of the problem."" Shapiro explained that some of the problems in getting professors to staff the Colloquia stem from the trend at Columbia where more and more professors teach two classes per semester rather than three. While Professors Marcus and Shapiro remember a time when four Colloquia were offered a semester, servingI w approximately 30 seniors and 30 juniors, the current Colloquia's limited resources have made it so that only one class is offered per semester, serving 15 students in total. Today's Columbia College students, who find themselves in larger classes, may lose out on a muchneeded opportunity to have that last connection with what the College's glossy pamphlets market as that which makes Columbia unique. Where Do We Go From Here? After spending three years sending out letters and trying to drum up support for their program within the Administration, the Colloquium Committee is ready to see some action. ""From my perspective, the institution has to make some kind of decision. Either see the Colloquium as important and commit to it or see other programs as more important, in which case defend that, justify that,"" Professor Shapiro said. ""I can live with any decision that's made as long as there's a decision."" If the Administration chose to support the Colloquia, Professor Shapiro suggested that it could be improved by bringing in high-level visiting professors or by making wide-ranging long appointments in faculty. Steven Marcus also noted, ""if it's going to continue, which I hope it will, there would have"
280,1923 College Discovers an Ideology and Changes,13 December 1999,"""We are here to gain a firmer message upon the realities of life, to get knowledge and to transmit it into wisdom, to find new understanding and to be guided to new interpretations, both of nature and of life and of organized man.""Although Nicholas Murray Butler's 1919 commencement speech was not directly addressing the College's brand new Contemporary Civilization course, his lofty sense of purpose for the University reflected Columbia's search for explanations of the unparalleled destruction caused by World War I. The faculty members who created the first class in Columbia's Core Curriculum in January of 1919 believed that an understanding of the present was predicated on the understanding of the philosophy and events of the past. Twenty years previously, a controversy raged in Columbia as the school began to drift toward what today's students would call a pre-profes-sional education, moving away from its traditional focus on liberal arts. The cause for an education that rooted itself in classical Western thought was championed by Professor John Howard Van Amringe, a reject of Columbia's 1890s Greek and Latin department and a mathematics professor who had a reputation for ""favoring athletes over serious students,"" according to An Oasis of Order, Timothy Cross's book on the Core Curriculum. Van Amringe wanted a liberal curriculum ""to teach [students] to look before and after, and in general to use their minds in ways which are appropriate to civil existence."" But Van Amringe, teaching at Columbia at the turn of the century, would fail at his attempt to shape the University into a haven of liberal arts that produced ""gentlemen.""It took until the First World War and a ""war issues"" course, offered at the request of the United States Army for their Student Army Training Corps, to stop the institution's slide toward pre-professional training. But by the time ""war issues"" became Contemporary Civilization in 1919, Van Amringe's lofty statement had been replaced by the desire to educate students who have knowledge of and question contemporary politics. ""The idea rests upon the belief that each new generation as it grows into maturity needs to be aware of the problems of its own group,"" said John J. Coss, first director of the CC program. ""And [they] should be brought to some appreciation of its responsibility within that group."" It is ""an attempt so to inform the students that their social usefulness will be increased in proportion as they follow the methods of intelligent investigation and discrimination,"" said then-Columbia College Dean Herbert Hawkes. Today, as Columbia celebrates the Core's 80th birthday, Van Amringe's statement is an ideal philosophy that attempts to give purpose to Columbia's College insistence that its students take CC, along with Literature, Music and Art Humanities. Coupled with the additions of Logic and Rhetoric and distribution requirements in Major Cultures, science, foreign languages, and physical education, the Core provides the undergraduate College with a universal identity. ""Having this very solid undergraduate education prepares you for life,"" saidDirector of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly. Because every undergraduate in the college must take the full Core Curriculum, it provides a common academic experience for all students to share with one another. Cross said that these required classes give students a common vocabulary ofthe means for intellectual 4f discourse. The ""war issues"" class was in part created to explore the issues surrounding the current conflict in Europe. The end of the war marked the shift in ideology from war issues to issues that concerned American citizens in times of peace, and was temporarily renamed ""peace issues"" and then ""Contemporary Civilization."" The move to institute a mandatory general education course was met with opposition by some faculty members. Many professors felt that the proper mission of a University was to prepare students for future professional work and that a liberal arts education was becoming superfluous in an increasingly modern world. In turned out that CC proved so popular that a second year was added in 1928. The freshman course, CCA, focused on historical issues that shaped the present, while the second year, entitled CC-B, focused on current political and economic problems. However, CC-B proved less popular among students than CC-A. After persisting for a number of years, a 1959 committee recommended that the course no longer be required. The University followed this suggestion in 1961. At the same time that CC was flourishing, Columbia added a General Honors course in 1920 at the behest of Professor of English John Erskine, 'OO. The precursor toOLiterature Humanities, the course was a two-year sequence offered to elite students who passed examina-tions and received personal recommendations from professors. The course consisted of small discussion groups reading well-known works of literature in translation, as Literature Humanities does now, but was discontinued when a second year of CC was added to the curriculum. Given the success of CC in the early '3os, Professor Mark Van Doren led a movement to add a sequence of literature courses to the general education program. The first course entitled Humanities A and later renamed Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), began in 1937 and was required for first-years. The syllabus incuded literature that dated back to medieval times. The second required course, Humanities B, was devoted to fine arts and music and was to be taken in the sophomore year. In 1941, Humanities B was split into two separate semester-long classes that covered art and music individually. Music and Art Humanities became a required component of the Core Curriculum in 1947. There have been several failed attempts to add a science course similar in scope to the humanities to the Core. As early as 1934, Hawkes oversaw the development of an optional two-year science sequence. Loosely modeled after CC, the courses provided a general education in the natural sciences. In 1941, however, with faculty focusing their efforts on World War 11, Science A and B were dropped. Since then, other attempts to addft* general, inclusive science classes to the core have been unsuccessful. According to Cross, among others, science often involves lab work, and thus it would be difficult to offer nonspecific overview courses. The Core thrived in the years following World War 11, solidifying its place in the College and in Western education. Administrators and professors from other universities regularly took trips to Columbia to observe its famed Core. Humanities A and CC sections were taught by some of the College's most distinguished faculty members, including Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, '25. Adding to the Core's influence within the University was the 1959 decision to require engineering students to take some Core classes. However, the Core did have its opponents. Increasingly, students and faculty denounced Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization as the study of dead white males. In the aftermath of the 1968 protests, students deemed the Core to be conservative, Eurocentric, and irrelevant. In 1970, a committee headed by Professor Robert Belknap proposed replacing Core classes with distribution requirements. In response to the committee's suggestion to end CC, the editors of the alumni publication Columbia College Today wrote: ""Even if the course is still basically sound, its eventual disappearance would not necessarily be a tragedy."" In retrospect, Professor William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, described the committee's recommendations as ""insignificant"" and said that the Administration never seriously considered implementing the plan. In 1988, a committee headed by de Bary asserted that CC and Lit Hum should maintain a Western focus and recommended that the Core be extended to include new courses that would examine Asian and African civi-"

282,"Often Overlooked, Smaller Depts. Thrive",22 March 2000,"By DAVID SOLOWAY Columbia Daily Spectator■ Despite enticing options that smaller departments provide, most undergraduates are looking elsewhereUndergraduates often come to Columbia in search of one-on-one interaction with their professors, small class sizes that attempt to fos-ter discussion and student participation, and advisers who actively guide stu-five majors are often understaffed, cannot always offer the numerous courses that are needed to fill the excessive demand, and lack the necessary personnel to guide individually the hundreds of students that are a part of their discipline. It is in many of the other smaller departments that students would appear to reap the most rewards, as majors like Classics, art history and archaeology, and religion, among others, provide a menu of options that seem very enticing to the average undergraduate. While these departments often face the burden of less flexibility and fewer resources than their fellow departments, they offer much of the personal attention that many Columbia students say their education often lacks. ""Many of our students have had a higher level of satisfaction in our discipline because they never have the fear of going unnoticed,"" said Roger Bagnall, chair of the Classics Department for six years. ""Our undergraduates are attracted at first because of material, but they thrive because of the individual contact and because of the attention that is given to each and every major."" Yet regardless of the benefits that Bagnall praises, the flow to the larger departments appears to be a growing trend. ""I understand that the smaller departments provide me with certain aspects that I might not be able to find elsewhere,"" said future Economics/Political Science major Dany Berghoff, CC 'O3. ""But I'd rather spend my college years pursuing what I enjoy, and the more popular disciplines just interest me a lot more."" Some departments fear the possibility that a lack of student interest will either lead to a drasticdents down their desired path. Yet when choosing a major, a majority of the undergraduate population opts to follow the masses, as most drift to the departments of economics, political science, history, English, and psychology. Students consistently say that thesereduction in the size of the faculty of their department or, in the extreme case, will lead to the extinction of the department. Pierre Force, chair of a French Department that has approximately 35 undergraduate majors and concentrators, worries that his major will eventually reach the point where it will be too small, a dilemma of which the faculty of the more popular departments can only dream.""Our primary concern is that we will lose the major,"" Force said. ""Our faculty size has a strong correlation with the number of majors we have, and any given year we could lose our students to the other departments."" Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen believes that for many students, it is simply a default decision to go to the more popular majors. But he added that the University takes steps to preserve the smaller departments, not simply looking at enrollment numbers when determining the allocation of funds. ""Undergraduate instruction is a primary mission of any department, but the smaller ones are obviously able to provide those undergraduates with more personal interaction,"" Cohen said. ""We would love to see students spread out on a larger level, but that is something we would never attempt to mandate. The University prides itself on being strong in every department, and it is for the students to choose where to spend their time."" The decision to take the road less traveled is one that is not met with much enthusiasm by many students. But it is a decision with its advantages and disadvantages, as the smaller departments provide their undergraduate majors withboth much to be desired and much that they have no way of providing. Strengths A student has a strong possibility of dedicating a significant portion of his/her Columbia career to one of the five most popular majors without ever developing a personal relationship with any one professor. In the smaller departments, the lack of individual contact is a rare occurrence. ""We make a large effort to make sure that each student is actively involved in the major,"" said Hamid Dabashi, acting chair of the Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures (MEALAC) Department. ""We have just 30 juniors and seniors that we are responsible for each year, and we strive to have each one leave feeling that they have relationships with our faculty that have influenced their college careers."" The extreme case of student/professor interaction is best seen in the Italian Department, where five full-time professors teach the eight tol2 majors and concentrators. 'We are a small and friendly department where one-on-one interaction is not only available, but necessary for the student to take full advantage of what the department has to offer,"" said Jo Ann Cavallo, acting chair and associate professor for the Italian Department. Most of the smaller departments also offer smaller courses to their majors. While some of the introductory courses offered to all undergraduates, including Core classes, are often large lecture classes, the more advanced courses usually have a number of students that facilitates good discussion. In the MEALAC Department, the average class size that a major will see is from 10 to 40 students, according to Dabashi. Religion majors rarely take classes with more than 20 students, according to Department Chair David WeissHalivni. The Classics Department offers a couple of lectures with 60 students, but most of its classes have 15-30 people, according to Bagnall. ""Class participation is an integralpart of teaching,"" Dabashi said. ""And the only way to guarantee that each of our majors will actively participate in class discussions is to provide them with the intimate setting to do so."" But perhaps the most advantageous quality of the smaller departments is the guarantee that students will always know what is required and how to best meet their needs and desires in the department. ""I never have to worry about being led down the wrong path,"" Classics major Frank Mazarela, CC 'Ol, said. Advisers meet with their students multiple times throughout the semester, and the departmental representatives don't see the large loads of students that the advisers from the larger departments do. Bagnall said that in the Classics Department students are not only required to meet often with the departmental representative, but they often feel comfortable consulting their professors as well for advice. ""Our representative has a manageable load, and for that reason our students get most of their ques-"
283,Cross Examines Evolution Of Core Curriculum at CU,22 March 2000,"By DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily SpectatorAs Contemporary Civilization (CC) enters its 80th year, the history of the Core Curriculum has been filled with constant questioning of its purpose and content, historian and author of a book on the Core Timothy Cross said last night at the Faculty House. Cross opened the seminar by explaining that he thought the title of his book, An Oasis of Order, which was decided on by the members of the Trustee committee that commissioned him to write it, was misleading. ""There's order insofar as there's been a set curriculum for 43 years, since the introduction of Art and Music Humanities. But the real story has been one of rethinking,"" Cross said. The Core now must readjust to the University's Enlargement and Enhancement program, which has created a strain on Core faculty, according to Cross. ""There was a time when all thehumanities instructors could sit around a single table,"" Cross said, pointing out that the number of Literature Humanities sections in any given semester has risen from 20 to well over 50 since its 1937 inception. But Cross said that the Core was never as stable as some assume. CC, the flagship of Columbia College's commitment to general education, came about in 1919 partially as a reaction to the College's movement towards pre-professional education at the turn of the 20th century. Cross said that CC's rise to prominence was not without bumps in the road. CC was originally divided into two courses: CC-A the equivalent of what the CC students know today, and CC-B, which focused on current political and economic problems. CC-B was never popular, and, after the increasing specialization of the social sciences in the 19505, was terminated. CC was followed by the Colloquium on Important Books, a survey of great Western literature,in 1932. The colloquium was open to juniors and seniors only by application. This process came under criticism for its elitism, and the colloquium was transformed in 1937 to Humanities A, later called Literature Humanities, which was open to, and eventually required of, all entering students. Cross said that the Core came to a crossroads in 1970, in the midst of the University turmoil of the late 19605. A committee headed by Professor of Slavic Languages Robert Belknap suggested replacing it with distribution requirements. The Administration did not,however, adopt this policy. Cross said he was pleased with his book's subtitle, The Core Curriculum and its Discontents, because it captures the contentious nature of the Core and because it referenced Freud's Civilization and its Discontents, one of the most popular CC texts.There was a time when all the humanities instructors could sit around a single table.' —Timothy Cross, historian and author"
284,Seeing the Music CU Celebrates the Evolution Composition,12 July 2000,"CU Celebrates the Evolution CompositionBY PETER CARTER Columbia Summer Spectator""What is exciting to consider is that youngsters in school today are growing up with exposure to electronic music, and it is an accepted part of their musical life... The future is wide open for the medium."" The year was 1970 and the speaker was Otto Luening, Professor Emeritus of Music at Columbia and co-founder of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (re-named the Computer Music Center (CMC) in 1995). The occasion was a retrospective of electronic music in Low Library. This Thursday, the next generation of electronic music makers returns to the Rotunda to celebrate the past half-century of electronic music and to showcase their current projects. The event, entitled Masterpieces of 20th Century Electronic Music, is part of Lincoln Center's Electronic Evolution series. On May 9, 1952, Professor Vladimir Ussachevsky gave the first electronic music concert in the United States at Columbia's McMillin Theater (now Miller Theater). A member of Columbia's music faculty, Ussachevsky joined with Luening that October for the first American public performance of tape recorder music at the Museum of Modern Art. At the time, recorded music was state-of-the-art. ""It was a big deal,"" said CMC director Brad Garton, ""to take a note and move it 10 seconds forward or backward, rearranging sounds in time through tape splicing."" In 1959, with a grant of $175,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation, Ussachevsky and Luening joined pro-fessor-composers Milton Babbit and Roger Sessions, both of Princeton University, to found the ColumbiaPrinceton Electronic Music Center, the first of its kind in the country. The prized possession of the new group was the custom designed RCA Mark II Synthesizer. ""Prior to theRCA Mark 11, composers had to set everything by hand,"" recalled Garton. The potential to use this synthesizer as an instrument itself was realized by Robert Moog, SEAS '57. ""Bob Moog took the voltage controlled oscillators [of the Mark II],"" saidGarton, ""and connected them to a keyboard."" Later, Wendy Carlos, working as a graduate student in the music department, would introduce electronic music to a nation of listeners. Her 1968 album Switched-On Bach, which consisted of pieces by Bach played on the Moog, would win three Grammy Awards and be the first classical music album to reach platinum sales levels. ""A lot of people felt that she was retrograding,"" said Garton. ""But it showed the world —and fueled the explosion of technology in music."" Professor Thanassis Rikakis, curator of the Masterpieces of Electronic Music event explained the climate of the period, saying, ""Columbia's music department was one of the first places in the country to make its technology available to students. Columbia in the '6os, said Rikakis, ""was a breeding ground for early electronic music technology."" The most recent commercial success story to come out of the CMC has been the Freight Elevator Quartet (FEQ). Band members Luke Dußois, CC '97, Rachael Finn, BC '99, Paul Feuer, CC '97, and Stephen Kreiger, CC '97, came together as undergraduates at Columbia and developed their sound and their software at the CMC. Founded in 1996, FEQ's most recent album was a collaboration with DJ Spooky entitled File Under Futurism. Their next album, Becoming Transparent, is due out this September. Rikakis cites FEQ as a great example of today's CMC. ""The center is very open to students and helping them realize their ideas,"" he said. Recently, the CMC has been nurturing interdisciplinary projects with other departments and schools at Columbia. Last semester, the Music and Art Departments at Columbia teamed up to offer Interactivity Out of the Box, a class where graduate students from across the School of the Arts' divisions design multimedia installation projects. Plans are underway for a class with Barnard's dance department as well as joint ventures with the electrical engineering and computer science departments. At the College ofPhysicians and Surgeons, researchers from the music department are working on what Rikakis refered to as a ""sound feedback for rehabilitation project."" ""I can't tell you any more,"" he said, ""because we're applying for a patent right now."" The news will be made public in August. This Thursday, from 8-9 p.m., seven installations will be presented in the Faculty Room of Low Library. The projects, created by Columbia graduate students, are hands-on opportunities for visitors to experience new computer music technologies. Soundscape Navigator, the project of Luke Dußois and Mark McNamara, is a demonstration of Quicktime virtual reality. ""We've taken sonograms and wallpapered a virtual room,"" said Dußois. ""What you seeds what you hear."" From 9-11 p.m., the CMC will present a concert featuring representative artists —Edgar Varese, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Paul Lansky, JeanBaptiste Barriere, Denis Smalley, and lannis Xenakis —and their works from the past 50 years of electronic music. The pieces have been specially chosen for their performance in the reverberant space of the Low Library Rotunda. For each piece, the composer will be introduced and his technique explained. Real-time maps, projected on a screen during the concert, will provide visual representations of the music's energy, amplitude, and frequency. Online program notes are available at www.music.columbia.edu/masterpieces. Beginning this Wednesday, Lincoln Center will present Electronic Evolution as part of its Festival 2000.

285,Core Professor Gray Inspired Students,29 January 2002,"By Amba Datta Spectator Senior Staff Writer■ Remembered for his dedication to teaching, Gray taught at CU for over forty years.As a young professor in Columbia's Department of English and Comparative Literature, Wallace Gray could never walkacross the Columbia campus in less than 25 minutes because his students always stopped to talk to him. When student protesters tookover Hamilton Hall in 1968, all classes were stopped from meeting except for Gray's because his students threw his books down to him so he could teach on the lawn. And his Eliot, Joyce, and Pound course was always packed full because his students were inspired by his love for the literature that moved him. In a time when professors have been said to focus their academic life to publishing, Professor Emeritus of English and Comparative Literature and SeniorScholar Wallace Gray dedicated himself to his students, making his teaching the focal point of a tenure at Columbia College that spanned over four decades. He died of a heart attack on Dec. 21 at the age of 74, leaving behind generations of former students and colleagues who were touched by his love of great books. ""He was a great mind, a wry wit, and the best teacher I've ever had or can ever hope to have,"" said Max Mayer-Cesiano, CC 'O3, a student in Gray's Literature Humanities class two years ago. ""Despite his sarcastic jokes about indoctrinating us into his world of Aristotelian ethics and modernist perspectives, what he managed to do in his class was to show many hundreds of students fresh out of high school, one small group at a time, how sophisticated a true scholar's view of the world can be."" Gray sparked an appreciation in his students for writers as diverse as James Joyce, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Flannery O'Connor. He gavehis time generously to his students and left many of them with vivid memories of his intellectual vigor coupled with his engaging dry humor and gracious manner. He left behind a legacy not of published volumes but of hundreds of Columbia College students who saw reflected through his human approach the great literature lessons they have since carried with them through life. ""For me, he defined what Columbia was about... the teaching process never stopped with him ... [and] the teaching never stopped after I left the school,"" said author Anthony Rudel, CC '79, a former Gray student, who became his close friend and relied on Gray as an editor for his own work. Gray took pride in being a teacher that challenged students with his perfectionist's eye, and he did so for decades, both in the classroom and outside, sitting on the steps of Low Library and over cof-fee in neighborhood coffee shops and diners with his students. Born in 1927 and raised in Alexandria, La., Gray attended Louisiana College. A pacifist, Gray volunteered for a medical unit in the U.S. Navy from 1944 to 1946 to avoid the Army draft. Gray's love of the cultural opportunities of New York was coupled with a hint of a Southern accent that betrayed his origins. His connection to the South expressed itself characteristically through a love for Southern writers including William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. During the Civil Rights movement, that connection also led him on trips from Louisiana to Mississippi with students to recruit African American voters. After receiving his M.A. from Louisiana State University, Gray came to New York City, began teaching at Columbia College in 1953, and received his Ph.D. in 1958 after studying under Columbia greats Lionel Trilling and Mark van Doren. Gray's philosophy on teaching was shaped by the legendary van Doren, and in 1975 Gray received the award in van Doren's name awarded by the students of Columbia College for excellent teaching. Gray believed, like van Doren, that a great teacher should be able to disappear at the end of a class, leaving students with the capability to connect with the texts on their own. ""When I began teaching, Mark van Doren advised me that 'teachers should be forgotten,""' Gray wrote in his book of essays on great literature, From Homer to Joyce. Gray's teaching career at Columbia never ended. He made the University his academic home for life, eventually becoming a Professor Emeritus and a SeniorScholar at Columbia. And all the while he never lost his passion for reaching students, continually worrying about his effectiveness as a teacher. ""It's a great tribute to him that he worried about it ... changing your practice is not a trivial thing,"" former student Roger Blumberg, CC 'B3, said. His courses evolved over decades and included the famous Eliot, Joyce, and Pound class and Literature Humanities, a course he taught for longer than any other professor at Columbia. An expert on James Joyce, Gray also taught courses on American drama, poetry, and oral interpretations of literature. Gray actively encouraged campus theater productions, which reflected a long-standing theatrical interest of his that stretched back to his high school years. Gray's younger brother, Aubrey T. Gray, remembered his role in high school as Petruchio in Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew best: ""He delivered an actual heavy-duty kiss to the Shrew at the prescribed time, instead of a 'stage kiss,' and she was pretty perturbed as she stormed off the set,"" he said. Gray wrote over a dozen plays, including an off-Broadway play entitled Helen, which opened in 1964, and a children's musical entitled The Cowboy and the Tiger. His most notable published scholarly work was From Homer to Joyce. ""You can hear his voice in that book,"" Professor Emeritus of Russian Robert Belknap said, ""unassuming, funny, and aware of all complexities."" Students remembered that voice well, recalling what Blumberg called Gray's capacity for being ""ironically bravado,"" making statements that sounded arrogant but were belied by his modesty and love of the give and take of an intellectu-al discussion. Those intellectual conversations were also central to his relationships with colleagues on the Columbia faculty. Although Gray served for a few years as assistant dean of the College beginning in 1967, he was a private person who steered clear of academic politics and forged his connections to professors through the books he taught. ""He was one of the people who concealed his hard work and his strong intellect ... The thing he made no effort to conceal was his warmth and friendliness,"" Belknap said. ""He loved the excitement of suddenly understanding something, and he worked to share that excitement with his students and his fellow teachers."" Senior Scholar James Mirollo recalled always running into Gray on street corners on Broadway and discussing books. ""We stood there like idiots in the freezing cold ... talking about Lit Hum ... it was central to his life,"" Mirollo chuckled. In the Literature Humanities class that was so important to him, Gray often searched through works for what his favorite writer Joyce described in Ulvsses as ""the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature,"" and he combined an emotional sensitivity with what he called his ""self-mocking, cynical humor."" He was the kind of man who was arrested by moments of beauty in life that moved him. In her comments at the ceremony for the Distinguished Service to the Core medal, which Gray received in 1997, Adjunct Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature and Director of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly shared an e-mail message that he wrote to her one morning. He wrote: ""Saw a beautiful sight on College Walk a few weeks ago—a boy walking with his mother with his arms around"
286,CU Prof. Barzun Honored at White House,30 July 2003,"By Isaac Vita Kohn Spectator News EditorEminent cultural historian and longtime Columbia professor Jacques Barzun received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civil honor, in a presentation in the East Room of the White House last week. Barzun, CC '27 and GSAS '32, was a pillar of Columbia's faculty and administration for decades. Colleagues and former students have described him as a beloved history teacher committed to undergraduate education and to the core curriculum. He also served as dean of graduate faculties and provost. The White House ceremony honored Barzun along with ten other distinguished recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ranging from professional athletes to a former head of state, putting Barzun in the company of such personages as actor Charlton Hestonand physicist Edward Teller. Current Provost Alan Brinkley said yesterday that he was ""very pleased to hear"" that Barzun was selected for the medal. Brinkley called Barzun ""a very worthy recipient."" ""It's hard to think of people who have had more impact on this university than he has,"" Brinkley said. ""He was and is a great scholar whose influence spans an extraordinary range of years."" Indeed, Barzun was an active member of the Columbia community for over 50 years. He began his long association with the history department as an instructor after graduating from the College in 1927, eventually becoming a full professor in 1945. He was selected as the Seth Low Professor of History in 1960, and the prestigious title of University Professor wasconferred on him in 1967. Barzun has been a University Professor emeritus since 1975. The history department is now home to an endowed professorship named in honor of Barzun. The current Jacques Barzun Professor of History and Social Science is Kenneth Jackson. But, Brinkley noted, Barzun ""was also a huge figure at Columbia in addition to being an extremely important figure in [the history] department.""Barzun was closely associated with Columbia's core curriculum. He taught Contemporary Civilization, and he was involved in the founding of the Colloquium on Important Books. (According to a College web page, Barzun once taught the colloquium with Lionel Trilling.) He was also involved in establishing and teaching Humanities A, the precursor to Literature Humanities. Barzun contributed to theColumbia community as an administrator as well, serving as dean of graduate faculties and provost between 1958 and 1967. To be sure, Barzun's influence extended far beyond Columbia. ""He was a great cultural and intellectual historian who had tremendous influence on the field for many years,"" Brinkley noted. ""He wasn't the first or the only person to be writing about culture, ... but he was one of the most eminent of the people in this field in the early years."" His influence was not limited to a scholarly audience. The text of the citation that was read during the presentation of the medal to Barzun last Wednesday called him ""an influential voice in American life."" ""Few academics of the last century have equaled his output and his influence,"" President George W. Bush said at the ceremony. ""And today he has the profound gratitude of his adopted country."" Bush also mentioned a best-sell-er published just three years ago, the most recent of dozens of books Barzun has written during his long career. From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life was just one of the many books that brought Barzun's widely acclaimed scholarship to a lay audience. Barzun, 95, lives in San Antonio, Texas.'Few academics of the last century have equaled [Barzun's] output and his influence.' —President George W.

As a Columbia College student, you've read—or at least were supposed to read—Homer, Herodotus,and Sophocles. Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes... Demosthenes? Who is Demosthenes? Well, never mind, don't give it a thought, just move on. Cicero, Vergil, and you continue your contented nodding. But however much College students and tour guides would like to claim that they've read worksof all the names on Butler, they're wrong. The engraved names on Butler wrap around to both the east and west sides as well. Horace, Tacitus, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Milton, Voltaire, and Goethe are all permanently honored on the mam-moth structure, though they are most likely only noticed by John Jay and Carman inhabitants who have a side view of the library. But Tacitus, Horace, Voltaire, Milton, and Goethe? While both Butler Libraryand the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization reading lists claim to bear the names of great thinkers and writers, neither was meant to be a reflection of the other. The names on Butler were chosen by Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia's president from 1902-1945, who oversaw the Library's construction. Butler chose the names of 18 thinkers to engrave along the facade of the building that now bares his name, as well as the names of 24 American statesmen and authors which are inscribed on the panels under the large front windows. It seems that the choice of these names was based on nothing more than Butler's whims. At the time, Contemporary Civilization began with Medieval philosophy and primarily used secondary sources. Literature Humanities wasn't instituted until 1937, three years after the Library's construction, although it was preceded by an optional literature course called General Honors, which lasted two years and listed 75titles. Tacitus, Milton, Voltaire, and Goethe have all been read at one time or another in Literature Humanities. So why are they off the syllabus now? According to Chair of Literature Humanities Michael Seidel, books in Lit Hum ""have been read for, in many instances, 3000 years, and when they work themselves off the consciousness of the human race, then they'll drop off of the humanities list. As long as people are transfixed, perplexed, and in some cases, entertained, these books will remain."" But Seidel acknowledged that the Lit Hum reading list ""does adjust slowly to the habits of reading and to the tastes of the culture."" While both Lit Hum and CC are meant to showcase works that have significance in any age, Tacitus is the one author to have lasted very shortly in direct response to the crises of a particular time period. His writings Annals and Germany remained on the Lit Hum syllabus for only three years during World War 11, from 1942-1944. In the 1980s, Lit Hum choices similarly reflected the pressure of aspecific era, this time to pay more attention to works by women. Columbia College began accepting women in 1983, and protestors at the time took to heart the supposed significance of Butler Library's engraved names and draped banners bearing I the names Sappho, Austen, Woolf, I and other female authors beneath. The Core began to change its syllabus in response, adding Sappho, Madame de Lafayette, and Jane Austen to the Lit Hum syllabus in the mid-1980s. ""Recently, Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf have been the major women writers, in the theory that women began to be read in the Renaissance and 17th century, but in the 19th century, they really started to produce great works of literature,"" Seidel said. Voltaire has been featured on the Lit Hum syllabus for his works Candide, Zadig, and Micromegas, and on the CC syllabus for his satirical writings against the Church. Professor Pierre Force, who teaches Voltaire in his French Philosophy class, reasoned that Voltaire may no longer be on the syllabus because though ""he crystallized the debates of the time,he's not remembered as someone who invented an original system of philosophy or new doctrine."" But Contemporary Civilization Chair Philip Kitcher argued that one could make a case for the reading of Voltaire in CC. ""He's a very good representative and advocate of reason triumphing over faith,"" said Kitcher, who used to have his students read Candide over winter break. Goethe, the most recent author dropped from Literature Humanities, might not be permanently gone, according to Seidel. ""Some [authors] drop off and then are put back on with the intent to vary the works a bit. There have been 12 different Euripides plays and as many Shakespeare."" And Demosthenes and Horace? As far as can be determined from the backlogs of CC and Lit Hum, these two authors, one a Greek orator and the other a Roman poet, have never been on either of the syllabi. They were merely favorites of Nicholas Murray Butler. So, if you really want to say that you've ""read all of Butler,"" start cracking the books—you've missed a few."
291,RETROSPECTIVE Unproctored Exams Favorably Received,5 December 2006,"Unproctored Exams Favorably Received""Poll Shows 'Honor Attitude' Experiment In Humanities Midterm Successful"" by Barry Dickman, Mon. Dec. 3, 1956 Initial reaction to the ""Honor Altitude"" seems favorable, judging by the answers given on questionnaires filled out by students who took the unproctored Humanities A exams during the recent midterm period. These polls consisted of five objective queries and three more general questions. Students were asked to comment on the success of the unproctored system, and to tell how they felt about the ""Honor Attitude"" as it applied to class and to personal affairs. According to Gary Angleberger '57, chairman of the Student Board Honor Commission, 56 questionnaires of the 124 distributed were returned. Freshmen appeared to be most optimistic about the future of the ""Honor Attitude."" Sophomores displayed more indifference, and many sophomores and juniors were doubtful about the plan's practicality. ""The attitude of honor is the test of a truly mature in-dividuaL.which we should all strive to attain,"" noted one freshman. '1 would be even less apt to cheat if I were put on my honor,"" commented another. This uncritical outlook and optimism about the possibilities of furthering the concept of honor in College men predominated among freshmen. On the other hand, a typical upperclassmen's re-sponse noted that ""on the whole 75% of the Columbia students are honest,"" and wondered ""What can you really do to change those who cheat?"" From the few students who expressed a completely unfavorable attitude to the idea came such comments as ""If one has not acquired a positive ethical code by now in his personal affairs he can only be pitied,"" and ""Since there is no indoctrination, as soon as the newness wore off cheating would begin again.""H ©V2)"
292,"Rosand-Colored Glasses How the award-winning professor sees the Renaissance, the Core",12 April 2007,"How the award-winning professor sees the Renaissance, the CoreBY MERRELL HAMBLETONThere are no uncluttered surfaces in David Rosand's ninth-floor office. Spillover from shelves arranged with art history books and jackets, curling with age and use, have taken over the ample room, filling up the desk space where youd expect to find a computer. My first meeting with Professor Rosand, which took place in this room last spring over the topic of a paper on Albrecht Durer, was conducted across dust-gather-ing stacks of paper and journals. A notebook balanced precariously in my lap, I remember Rosand, hands and legs folded neatly, looking at me matter-of-factly over the rim of his reading glasses. ""How's your German?"" he asked, as though inquiring about the weather. In March, the Renaissance Society of America awarded Rosand the Paul Oskar Kristeller Lifetime Achievement Award for dedication to the study of the Renaissance. In a sense, the award confirms my wide-eyed, underclassman conception of Rosand: the well-read, quick-spoken, unflinchingly bright, Old World-art historian. Yet this image of Rosand lacks nuance. While the Kristeller award solidifies his position in the succession of notable Renaissance scholars, Rosand's intellectual interests are hardly restricted to pre-1700 Italy. ""When I graduated Columbia College, I wanted to be an abstract expressionist,"" Rosand says with evident amusement. Realizing his painting wasn't up to scratch with his scholarship, Rosand headed back to Columbia for a Ph.D. in art history. Still, Rosand found himself drawn to modernism —not surprising, given the era. The late 'sos were the heyday of Professor Meyer Schapiro, considered by many to be Columbia's preeminent scholar of modern art and whom Rosand, in a recent article, described as a man who ""came to personify art history at Columbia and to stand for a particularly American approach to the study of art."" Rosand recalls Schapiro lectures vyhere ""artists filled the front row —Barnett Newman, Saul Steinberg,"" to name a few. Rosand speaks eagerly about Leo Castelli's gallery on 77th Street, where in 1958 he saw seminal shows by two young artists, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. A shift from abstract expressionism to pop art and conceptualism was dramatically changing the art world, and Rosand was witness. With some fellow graduate students, Rosand (who as an undergraduate at the college wrote for the Jester) began to write criticism in a self-published journal, The Second Coming Magazine. There is clear nostalgia in Rosand's voice when he speaks of engagement with contemporary art, yet he describes his move to the Renaissance as though it had beena forgone conclusion. This move began in collaboration with Rudolf Wittkower, who at that time was doing important work on Venetian architecture and with whom Rosand would ultimately do his doctoral work. As a young scholar, Wittkover had published a twovolume corpus of drawings by Bernini, work that had previously been dismissed as unworthy of serious study. Wittkower s faith in the significance of the line and the artist had a strong impact on the young Rosand, who began to understand a coherent trajectory that could be traced from artists and theorists like Titian and Alberti to Picasso. Rosand speaks of the Renaissance in sweeping terms, as ""a time when the world was being extended by artists."" Even more critical than this, Rosand says, is, ""the emergence of the understanding of the creative ... and critical power of the line."" The Renaissance was simply the most logical place to start. In many ways, Rosand's commitment to the Renaissance is just that—a starting point. As we talk, it's as if Rosand has taken the theoretical principles expounded by the Renaissance and applied them wholeheartedly to his study of art as a whole. An incongruous piece of Chinese brushwork that hangs over Rosand's desk is proof of his fascination with the ""creative and critical"" line. Robert Harrist, professor of Chinese art and current chair of the art history department, describes the introduction to Rosand's book Drawing Acts, which deals with drawing in the West, as""one of the best things I've ever read about Chinese painting ... he [Rosand] writes about the power of lines to both define representational forms and to embody the physical act of making a mark on the surface"" —elements that Harrist and Rosand understand as essential tothe understanding of painting and drawing. Rosand's inheritance of Wittkower's broader definition of canonical art extends well beyond the 16th and 17th centuries. He speaks with great admiration of Wittkower's efforts to bring African and Oceanic art into the fold, not just as examples of a marginalized ""Other,"" but as legitimate, aesthetic forms, and calls his mentor ""responsible for the new direction of the art history department."" The specter of the Dead White Male has consistently proven a point of conflict between the critics and architects of the Core. One might expect that Rosand, in his enthusiasm for the inherent ties between Western and non-Western art, might fall amongst the critics. Yet when I inquire about Art Humanities, a class that reaffirms the Western canon (and includes the works of only one woman), Rosand offers a stern defense. ""Its not a survey,"" he says. ""It's meant to teach students how to talk about art."" According to Rosand's philosophy, this skill should provide a more-than-adequate foundation for learning about all art. As Harrist puts it, ""Professor Rosand is able to see how the energy and animation that a Chinese connoisseur appreciates in a brush-drawn line are like those in drawings by Raphael or Rembrandt."" Rosand, who was a student of art history at Columbia before there was such a thing as the ""feminist"" or ""multiculturalist"" discourse, presumably hopes that Art Hum will provide the analytical background necessary for understanding the expanded art historical canon. Asked to discuss the state of Renaissance studies in the context of a broadening art historical discipline, Professor Rosand is less quick to defend the subject than anticipated. While he encourages expansion of new departments, he says that there is a degree to which the Italian Renaissance is ""fading out."" And yet, ""it is a period that needs to be rearticulated, defended,"" he says. ""There are aesthetic reasons for the emergence of Michelangelo and Rembrandt... Picasso is constantly going back to Rembrandt."" What might be viewed as Rosand's Western orientation is. tempered by his active effort to identify common motives in art. The Renaissance may be his point of origin, but Rosand has every desire to see a world extended by art historians. ■"
293,"Here's to You, Jacques Barzun",2 October 2007,"There are Columbia professors, and there are Columbia institutions. Jacques Barzun is the latter. Undergraduate, provost, and everything in between, professor Barzun fundamentally redefined the Columbia experience through a half-century of dedicated service. Western, worldly, and undeniably brilliant, Barzun faithfully embodies the University's greatness. As we approach his 100th birthday, a personal centennial, it is worth reflecting on his many accomplishments—for his is truly a Columbian life. Born in Creteil, France and raised among Paris' avant-garde intellectuals, Barzun gave his first lesson at just nine years old in the midst of the First World War. As fate would have it, he has yet to stop. Sent first by his father to preparatory school in the United States, Barzun entered Columbia College in the mid-1920s. Matriculating at the top of his class ('27), Barzun began to teach formally while pursuing his Ph.D. ('32). This relationship lasted until 1955 when the University promoted him first to dean and later to provost. For the 13 long years until his return as University Professor in 1968, a position he held until his retirement in 1975, Barzun remained a central figure in the Columbia administration. His intellectual pursuits and academic record proved invaluable for an administrator dealing with a university in a time of great fluctuation. A naturally gifted writer, Barzun muses on all subjects from art and music to what mightquite possibly be the most challenging of all, writing itself. But never has he failed to include his trademark charm, lucidity, and insight. As a scholar, the young Columbian broke ground as the vanguard of an emerging new discipline, cultural history. The author of well over 20 books, Barzun shaped and guided the nascent field to popular acceptance and use. In short, he is just as much an academic giant beyond Columbia's gates as he is within. Barzun's last monumental work, the 800-plus-page survey of Western civilization a decade in the making, From Dawn to Decadence , stands as testament to that fact. The dark-horse New York Times bestseller introduced a new generation to the still-mesmerizing nonagenarian. Equal parts historian, anthropologist, philosopher, writer, and social critic, Barzun completed in his twilight years that which would take the rest of us a lifetime. Many on the transadantic right respect Barzuns generally positive attitudes toward Western culture and his desire to preserve its key elements. In his review of From Dawn to Decadence , Roger Kimball, the old-ppard editor of The New Criterion, calls Barzun ""a voice of moderation and sanity in American intellectual life for some six decades."" In 2003, President George W. Bush presented professor Barzun with his long-deserved Presidential Medal of Freedom, Americas highest civilian honor. With few exceptions, Barzun is the closest thing Columbia has to a conservative professor. And no, this isn't grounds to discount him. Rather, Barzun is emblematic of a different Columbia. Compared to todays professors-turned-pundits, a practice that would make any good Kantian weep, Barzun kept his studies and classroom apolitical. Instead he focused his energies on celebrating and sharing Western civilizations great texts. Barzun had a direct handin the creation of Humanities A, that which we so lovingly call Lit Hum, and proved a key supporter of two new programs, Art and Music Humanities. Columbian Thomas Vinciguerra perfectly captures Professor Barzun's quick wit as he describes one of the Core's earliest and shortest debates: Arguing against Music Humanities, ""Professor of music Douglas Moore roared, 'We don't want freshmen wiping their feet on Bach.' Barzun hastily retorted, 'Doug, freshmen have been wiping their feet on Shakespeare for years.' Moore immediately withdrew his objection."" Barzun's own class offerings were equally impressive. For decades he co-taught a graduate seminar with famed literary cridc Lionel Trilling. Known to the registrar as ""Historical Bases of English Literature,"" students called it something far more appropriate: ""Great Books."" It rightfully goes down in academic lore as one of the greatest courses ever offered—it was Columbia at its intellectual zenith. For many, its contemporary equivalent, a seminar with Vaclav Havel and Umberto Eco, wouldn't pose the slightest challenge. Long overdue, the Society of Columbia Graduates will present professor Barzun with the Great Teacher Award on Oct. 18th. While 1 haven't had the pleasure of meeting professor Barzun or reading all his work, there are coundess alumni, former students, and Barzun aficionados to put me in my place. They revere professor Barzun as not only an academic, but a naturally kind and good-hearted human being. In my eyes, there is no better compliment for a man who gave his life and career to Columbia. So here's to you, Professor Barzun. Happy 100 th birthday. • Chris Kulawik is a Columbia College senior majoring in political science. Chris Shrugged runs alternate Tuesdays.

294,Editorial RAISE YOUR VOICE Core Reform Major Cultures must become a more central part of the curriculum,13 November 2007,"Core ReformMajor Cultures must become a more central part of the curriculumThe following editorial is the second in a week-long series concerning activism and involvement at Columbia. The severity of the strikers' protest methods and the criticism surrounding their demands raises importatn questions about the place of students' voices in affecting change at the University. Reform to the Core Curriculum is a central part of the strikers' demands, but has also been a concern for many other students. The administration has suggested that it is willing to begin the slow process of change, and there is much to be said about the nature of Major Cultures and its place in the Columbia tradition.Among the laundry list of concerns from the students who are hunger-striking is a call for reform of the Core Curriculum. While many of the strikers' demands are overly broad and misdirected, administrators should heed their call for call for change to the college's class requirements. Every student should graduate from Columbia College having thought critically about tne ways race, class, and gender affect the human experience both in Western civilization and throughout the world. These issues are as much a part of our society as Adam Smith's invisible hand or John Stuart Mill's ideas of liberty, and the University's Core should reflect that. These hunger strikers are not the first students to call for major changes to the Core. For years, students have derided Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization for their Western focus. Both courses include only a handful of works by women and non-white writers and thinkers. In recent years, the Committee on the Core has made efforts to address these concerns, adding a twocourse Major Cultures requirement that aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of nonWestern cultures. While the addition was a good first step, as it is currently structured, it does notcompel students to examine meaningfully the mores and intellectual history of non-Western cultures. -Instead of an afterthought, Major Cultures should be the third prong of a rigorous and challenging curriculum. Like Lit Hum or CC, this should include a small seminar that immerses students in a particular culture and allows them to engage and understand it. This course should also address the ways in which members of the culture immigrated and live in the United States. This would provide students a chance to understand how race and ethnicity shape a particular culture's experience in our country, with particular attention to the struggles of assimilation and institutional designs that make life more difficult. There are already a handful of courses that do this, such as Latin American Humanities, a two-se-mester literature and culture class. However, the University should require every student to take a one-se-mester seminar that not only deals with a culture of his choice, but also address the issues of race and class that play ou within that society on a global level. Barnard is already taking steps to rethink its Nine Ways ofKnowing, and Columbia ought to follow suit. Although the list of demands from the hunger strikers is long, Core reform should not be lost in the shuffle."
295,More Than Lip Service,28 January 2009,"This fall, Columbia College will begin the phased replacement of the Core Curriculum with a new singlesemester Frontiers of Humanities course. A pilot program for the 2009-10 school year will give students the opportunity to take Frontiers of Humanities instead of the current general humanities requirements —two semesters of literature, two of philosophy, one of music, one of art, and two of global cultures. It will be followed, pending review, by a subsequent University-wide replacement. Renowned Kant scholar Patricia Kitcher will kick off the Frontiers of Humanities semester with an introductory lecture on grammar and punctuation, titled ""Semicolon or Colon? The Grand Grammatical Mystery."" Former U.S. Poet Laureate Mark Strand will follow with a series of lectures on why poetry does not always have to rhyme. The semester will conclude with a discussion by Mahmood Mamdani, recently named by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the world's top-100 intellectuals, on the names and locations of countries in Africa. The weekly lectures will be supplemented by semiweekly seminars on selected topics in the humanities, including ""songs"" and ""paintings."" If it isn't yet obvious, Frontiers of Humanities is a less-than-subtle jab at Frontiers of Science, a class that seeks to do with natural and applied science what the Core Curriculum already does with Western art, music, philosophy, and literature. Opinions about Frontiers of Science are polarized, but one thing is for sure: while it is commendable that the University has added to the Core what Frontiers'Web site calls ""an essential contribution of Western civilization,"" Frontiers of Science and the coupled ""Courses Designed for Nonscience Majors"" are insufficient. The study of the natural sciences cannot be shoehorned into the same pedagogical structure as can much of the humanities. A survey class on ""science"" coupled with two perfunctory courses that are often without a single problem set is inadequate. Science cannot be studied in a qualitative and deliberately superficial way, but instead must be approached with respect for rigor and detail. As we have seen through the Core courses, to survey Western art and music is far more productive than to survey all of science, an understanding of which must be developed vertically rather than horizontally. The lack of a more rigorous set of requirements in the natural and applied sciences informs us of a very serious and far-reach-ing state of affairs. On a national scale, little more than lip service has been paid to science over the past decade, and science funding rapidly approaches humorous levels. A series of studies by www.scienceprogress. org, using information from the American Academy of Science and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, shows that for 2007, ""the slight increase in the dollars for non-de-fense R&D [research and development] was more than surpassed by projected inflation."" Federal investments in this area in the early 1960s totaled around 2 percent of GDP, but today they are only about half of that. Nonetheless, there is cause for optimism for the future of science, and Columbia must herald the transition. In the spirit of growth and innovation espoused by U.S. President Barack Obama, CC 'B3, who said in his inaugural address that ""we will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders"" and ""transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age,"" it is high time that our own university, culpable in its lack of dedication to wide-reaching science education, begin to take science more seriously. Because every student has accessto an academic arsenal stocked with some of the finest scientific investigators in the world, it is reasonable to expect chat every graduate of our university be scientifically literate. Our acceptance of scientific illiteracy is validated by our acceptance of a perceived dichotomy between scientists and non-sci-entists. We have come to take this separation for granted in the general public, but to welcome it at an academy is unacceptable. Science is hard, but not out of reach for anyone. Everyone has a basic scientific curiosity; this is a conviction that was embraced by the television program from which this column takes its name. NOVA , the ongoing show aired by PBS, has sparked a thirst for knowledge in countless viewers, the authors included. With its crisp and engrossing explanations of scientific phenomena, NOVA has made accessible to many people what was previously dry and distant, opening their eyes to the beauty inherent in scientific pursuit. At the root of our acceptance of scientific illiteracy is an unhealthy aversion to poking and prodding the things we don't understand, a willingness to leave to ""experts"" that which we do not in earnest try to grasp. It is the very opposite of this mentality that guides scientific progress: a belief in our ability to understand and explain that which we do not know. In the words of Albert Einstein, ""The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity."" We hope that, like NOVA, we can help Columbia regain that curiosity.

296,Soft and hard,11 April 2012,"A cademics often paint the ./jLcomparison between the sciences and the humanities as a juxtaposition between the ""hard,"" precise natural and applied sciences, and the ""soft,"" amorphous humanities. For those defining the curriculum of Columbia College, a primary goal has long been to matriculate well-rounded students with varied skills. In or-der to achieve this goal, faculty and administrators need to make the hard and the soft complementary and tailor our science requirement to reinforce the character and quality of our humanities education. The current science requirement is conceptually insufficient. It may teach students how to do rudimentary work across a handful of disciplines, but it does little to improve their ability to locate the importance of the sciences in a broader context The science requirement should offer us new ways to consider the impact of the sciences on our own fields of study and on society in general. The ideal requirement would still retain courses that offer introductions to basic practical skills, but it would emphasize possible paradigms through which to consider the sciences in respect to the humanities. While Frontiers of Science is commendable for its attempt to introduce basic research methods across different scientific disciplines, it lacks an overall narrative as to how these skills, and more pressingly, these disciplines, are relatable for a student of the humanities. Just as important as the ability to compute the destructive capacity of a nuclear weapon is an awareness of how the discoveries of atomic physics were co-opted and weaponized, and the social and historical significance of these events. Teaching the significance in tandem with the hard science would put both aspects into greater relief. For a humanities student, it may be most worthwhile to study the sciences in a systemic sense, which entails seeing the various scientific disciplines as ongoing projects located within institutions. We ought not study the sciences in order to exclusively learn aspects of output—formulas, laws, methods—that have little practical use to the average CC student, but rather to understand the processes that undergird science and the importance of intellectual rigor within individual and collective programs of research. From this standpoint, the sciences become highly relatable, for while the content of the research is different in nature—more quantitative, empirical, regimented—die context of the research can be easily understood through the lens of the humanities. A courseload that emphasizes the history, politics, sociology, economics, anthropology, or literature of science would be far more engaging for the student who realizes that it is a bit much to ask him to be a veritable polymath, and a bit useless to ask him to try halfheartedly anyway. The question at hand is not whether the sciences need to be diluted for consumption by non-science students, but whether an equally intellectually rich offering can be mustered. One that offers new ways to look at science would be valuable to even those well versed in the sciences. A new required course might be needed to facilitate this encounter, a kind of theoretical counterpoint to Frontiers and lab requirements. Realigning priorities in such a way, while still providing a basic skill set in applied and natural sciences, would enable students to remain mindful of the linkages between the humanities and sciences that so powerfully shape the world. It would also represent an acknowledgement on the part of Columbia College that the sciences are most salient insofar as many of the foundational thinkers of the humanities had backgrounds in the sciences. From Epicurus to Al-Ghazali to Newton, the great minds of history markedly approached the sciences and humanities in tandem, pursuing each with equal verve. And while as students we cannot reasonably expect to achieve their level of fluency, we can at the very least learn the significance of their multifaceted contributions. In doing so, we may come to place a higher value on the dialogue between the hard sciences and the soft, recognizing each for their respective strengths and interdependencies.

297,"New major to combine medicine, humanities",18 April 2012,"BY PARUL GULIANI Spectator Staff WriterThe Institute for Comparative Literature and Society is offering a new major next year to cater to students interested in the intersection of science and the humanities. The major, ""medicine, literature, and society,"" is an interdisciplinary course of study that ""examines the social and cultural dimensions of illness and health,"" according to the ICLS website. The major is similar to the existing comparative literature and society major in that it requires literature and culture courses in a language other than English, as well as courses in the humanities that correspond to a student's chosen area of specialization. MLS majors can choose to focus on literature and medicine, medical anthropology, or the history of medicine and public health. While some new courses are being created specifically for the major, many relevant courses are already offered by various departments. ""This is not just for premed majors,"" ICLS director Stathis Gourgouris said. ""But obviously, a premed person who feels they're interested in the humanities aspect of medicine would be the perfect person for this."" Gourgouris said that aproposal for the major was put together a year ago and was recently approved by the Committee on Instruction. Gourgouris and his colleagues were initially interested in offering a major that combined the humanities and the sciences. It made sense for them to propose a major connecting medicine and the humanities, Gourgouris said, because of the growing popularity of that field, which is generally known as ""medical humanities."" ""A lot of initiative comes from medical schools,"" he said. ""They are saying that though the students they are getting are very well-versed in science, they lack certain skills that they attribute to the humanities."" Joseph Slaughter, the director of undergraduate studies for the English and comparative literature department, was involved in early discussions about the proposed major. ""The major is intended to bring the methods of human-ities-based thinking to think about the health of the human being in society,"" Slaughter said. ""Medicine and health is the more obvious place to begin to think about those interconnections."" Students interested in global health, the politics of health, ecology, or environmental studies would also be a good match for the new program, Gourgouris added. Slaughter said that past students have asked for the creation of this type of major. ""I would say that I've seen eight or nine or 10 students who've been frustrated with the fact that they have to make a radical choice between the sciences and humanities,"" he said. The major is intended for students like Theo Di Castri, CC 'l2, who is currentlydouble-majoring in neuroscience and CLS, and who gave professors some advice on the creation of the new major. Di Castri said that while he would have preferred that students interested in the program be required to major in both a science and a humanity, the combined science/humanities major is ""definitely a step in the right direction."" ""It's a heavy load to do both, but I found it very productive,"" Di Castri said. ""They can't require people to do a double major. That's kind of asking a lot."" The major could also help prepare students for upcoming changes to the Medical College Admission Test. In addition to testing students on biology, chemistry, and physics, the MCAT will add a section in 2015 that measures critical analysis and reasoning skills. Professor Maura Spiegel, an associate director of the Narrative Medicine Program at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that the medical field is increasingly in need of humanities-oriented thinking. ""I think medicine, now more than ever, is so geared towards numbers and technology and ever-increasingly small lenses of focus,"" she said. ""Doctors are confronted with death and extreme sadness every day, but they never speak about it in human terms. This idea of putting language to one's feelings and experiences is an important tool."" Di Castri cautioned that there still needs to be a divide between medicine and the humanities. ""I think it's rare that it's all vogue right now—narrative medicine and all these hybrid products of science and humanities,"" he said. ""There's a place for that, but I think rather than just merging them, it also needs to be kept critical."" news@columbiaspectator.com"

That a two-year course to be known as Humanities A and B be organized as a required course for the Bachelor of Arts degree, meeting four hours per week and carrying four points credit during each session of the first year, and two hours per week with two points credit during each session of the second year; that the course be conducted with the cooperation of the Departments of Greek and Latin, English and Comparative Literature, Fine Arts, Music, Philosophy and the modern foreign languages; and that the course be under the administrative charge of the Committee on instruction which shall appoint an operating committee consisting of representatives of the abovementioned departments. With permission of the Committee on Instruction a student may substi-tute for Humanities B a year of advanced work of not less than three hours a week in one of the humanistic fields. 4. That in conjunction with the requirement in English C, each student in the freshman year be required to write one or more essays, aggregating 5000 words, in connection with such first-year courses as may be appropriate; that in the sophomore year each student be required to write a single 5000 word essay in connection with one of his courses; and that these requirements be administered by the Department of English with the advice and assistance of the instructors in whose courses the essays are written. 5. That the present course requirement for the degree in foreign languages be replaced by a requirement of proficiency in reading one of the following foreign languages—French, German, Greek or Latin, or another language with special permission of the Committee on Instruction; that the level of proficiency be set as follows: (1) in the case of a language presented for admission, at the point normally achieved by one year of College work following the' three yearsrequired for admission, or (2) in the case of a language not presented for admission, at the point normally achieved by two years of College work; that proficiency be determined by means of a test known as Langauge A; that the tests be administered by a committee organized under the Committee on Instruction and having a majority of its members from the foreign language departments; and that students now in residence be permitted, if they so choose, to satisfy the requirement in foreign languages by passing the above-described tests instead of fulfilling the old course requirements. 6. Resolutions One through Five shall become operative for students entering College in 1937."
299,Imposing Array of Faculty To Give Humanities Course,23 April 1937,"An imposing array of prominent faculty members are included on the staff of the new Humanities survey course. Six departments in the College will be represented by sixteen men. The course offers a survy of literature and philosophy and a study of music and the fine arts. Professors Irwin Edman and James Gutmann will represent Philosophy; Professors Joseph Wood Krutch, Mark Van Doren, Henry K. Dick, Charles W. Everett and Messrs. Frederick H. Rathert, W. Bradford Smith and Lionel Trilling, English; Dr. Jacques M. Barzun, History; Professor Otto P. Schinnerer, German; Dr. Simon R. Mitchneck and Messrs. Burdette I. Kinne and Jacques LeClercq, French; and Drs. Moses Hadas and Theodoric H. Westbrook, Greek and Latin. Since Professor Edman began lecturing here in 1918, he has achieved prominence as a writer and educator in Philosophy. Besides being the author of several philosophical works, including ""The World, The Arts, and The Artists"" and ""The Contemporary and His Soul,"" he has edited theworks of Plato. He is chairman of the committee prepariing the syllabus for the first year course. Professor ' Van Doren is a wellknown writer and editor. At present, he is motion picture critic for The Nation, and former literary editor. He has written much criticism, poetry and fiction and recently compiled and edited the ""Anthology of World Poetry"" and ""The Oxford Book of American Prose."" Professor Gutmann, Drs. Hadas, Barzun and Westbrook and Mr. Trilling give instruction in the Colloqium On Important Books, a special reading course designed for advanced upperclassmen. As Sophomores next September, members of the Class of 1940 may elect to take Humanities B, which deals with music and fine arts. Classes in this course meet twice a week, while in the first year four weekly meetings are scheduled. 1 September's yearlings will have to take four hours of Contemporary Civilization, as well as the Humanities course. Freshman English will be discontinued."
300,"Edman Describes Values Of Humanities Sequence Develops Judgement Of Literary Works, Professor Says",20 September 1937,"Develops Judgement Of Literary Works, Professor SaysBy IRWIN EDMAN(Invin Edman is Professor of Philosophy at Columbia and is Chairman of the program committee of Humanities A.) Perhaps the best way of describing the new Humanities A course, which will be required of all freshmen begining this fall, is to point out certain things which it is not, and which it is not intended to be, and which, in so far as things can be arranged in advance, there is no possibility of its becoming. It is not, in the usual and objectionable sense of that term, or indeed in any sense of the term, a ""survey"" course. It is not, and is not intended to be, a ""Cook's Tour through the history of European literature and philosophy. It is not a series of tid-bits from the Great Books of the World, designed to insure ""General Culture."" The positive aim of the course is perhaps adequately described in the first sentence of the announcement in the Columbia College catalogue. The aim of this course is to develop in the student literary taste and judgment, as well as habits of philosophical analysis, through a careful acquaintance with a series, in more or less chronological order, of the outstanding masterpieces in the literature and philosophy of the European tradition. Range from Homer to Goethe The readings range in time from Homer to Goethe; they include in type, plays: two from each of the great Greek dramatists in the first term, four plays of Shakespeare and three of Moliere, in the second term; philosophy: the ""Republic"" of Plato, and the ""Meditations"" of Marcus Aurelius in the first term, and Hobbes and Spinoza in the second term; poetry: the ""Divine Comedy"" of Dante, ""Paradise Lost"" of Milton; the novel: Fielding's ""Tom Jones,"" Cervantes' ""Don Quixote;"" the essay: Montaigne. But the list of authors and of readings does not pretend to be exhaustive, or even completely representative. There is, however, nothing on the list that, in the judgment of the program Committee or the staff of twenty, representing half a dozen different departments, who are to give the course this year, that is not of first-rate calibre in its own kind. Will Meet 4 Hours a Week An examination of the detailed program will reveal several striking facts about the nature of the project: The course will meet four hours a week; plenty of time is allowed in the schedule for careful reading of the actual texts. There will be no use of hand-books, or text-books, or outlines. Class discussion will be centered on the texts themselves, which will serve at once to acquaint the students with a set of masterpieces in literature and philosophy, and thereby to sharpen and discipline their powers of literary criticism and philosophical understanding. The course will not be conducted as a lecture course but as a discussion group founded on the careful reading (insured by frequent examinations) of the texts themselves. Through a happy arrangement with the Bookstore, the set of books to be used in the course, in available cheap editions, will be made accessible to ' s' udents at a very nominal price, ormay be rented for the semester at an even more nominal price. A Cooperative Project One of the functions that this course is designed to serve is to start or to nourish interests that may be developed in succeeding years by special study in one of the languages or literatures involved, or in philosophy. The project is a cooperative one, staffed by the departments of English, French, German, Greek and Latin, Philosophy, and History. Those of us who have been working on the program for the course feel that along with the General Science course and Contemporary Civilization, the Humanities course will provide a balanced and vertebrate curriculum for the first two years of Columbia College, the second year of the Humanities being devoted to a cooperative course given by the departments of Fine Arts and Music, which will aim to do for those fields what Humanities A will undertake to do for literature and philosophy. In the case of the Humanities course it is felt and hoped that this new project will provide something of an equivalent for the values derived by an earlier generations students from the whole classical curriculum, and' develop standards of taste and judgment by a disciplined acquaintance with some, at least, of ""the best that has been known and thought in the world."" It should be pointed out that although Humanities A is required, Humanities B, which is given this autumn as an elective course, will in succeeding years be required only for those who does not elect some specific course in the field of the Humanities. It should also be added that the new Humanities does not add to the burden of requirements in the first year, since English A, until now three hours a week, is no longer required, and Contemporary Civilization has been reduced from five to four hours a week."
301,Dean Hawkes Explains Humanities Course,29 September 1937,"This continues Dean Herbert E. Hatches' report on the year 1936-37 to President Nicholas Murray Butler. Our difficulty arises from the fact that some of those who are admitted to college are suffering from a delayed adolescence so serious that although they are of college age or perhaps beyond it in some respects, they are far below it in others. This difficulty can only be overcome by a desire on the part of the College to understand each individual and an attitude of cooperation on the part of the student in the enterprise of his education. As a corollary to the admission of the ""whole man"" there follows the necessity for becoming acquainted with him so far as possible, and attempting to provide the kind of education that is best adapted ro his needs. This rules out any set of hard and fast rules, applied to all without regard to individual cases. It does not mean that everyone follows the whims of the moment without let or hindrance; it does mean that so far as possible we replace rules by intelligence, although .'t would be much easier to use ""the rule of the Faculty"" as a substitute for thoughtful attention to each individual situation. The obvious danger in trying to conduct a college by intelligence rather than rules is that there may not be enough intelligence to go around. But even at that, I believe that this principle should be applied so far as possible. Justice Holmes expressed the same point of view when he said that ""To rest upon a formula is a slumber that, prolonged, means death."" Provide for Individual Needs The gradual adoption of achievement tests, the waiving of requirements which seem unprofitable to the individual, the flexible treatment of the work in English composition, the elimination of a rigid major requirement expressed in terms of credit points, the development of the advisory system, all point in the direction of provision for the individual needs of the individual student. One further guiding principle must be mentioned. The first two years of college, which may be called the Lower College, are useful for manystudents in finding their intellectual interest, or in verifying the accuracy of an earlier choice. For this reason wide rather than narrow fields of study are presented in the first two years, in preparation for the more intense specialization of the Upper College. Ever since the course in Contemporary Civilization was organized in 1918 this idea has been gaining ground steadily, until Faculty action last December carried it to its logical conclusion so far as the Lower College is concerned. Further Suggestions Expected The Committee on the Revision of the Curriculum, earlier referred • to, has presented only that portion of its report having to do with the Lower College. The recommendations regarding the Upper College are expected early in the coming Winter Session. The recommendations unanimously adopted by the Faculty in Decembercomprise three important features. The most striking one is the organization of a course in the humanities normally prescribed for freshmen and sophomores, together with the changes necessary for its proper offering. That is, the prescribed freshman course in English is withdrawn, and the course in Contemporary Civilization is reduced from five hours weekly to four. The work in English composition is reorganized and is related to the freshman's whole program for the subject matter of themes. The department of English will continue to read all themes for form and literary values. Explains Lack of Tests The requirement in the languages, either ancient or modern, is expressed in terms of a test of proficiency in reading the language instead of the previous course prescriptiori. The principal reason that this step has not been taken at an earlier time is the difficulty of preparing an examination in reading ability at the desired level which shall be reliable and comparable over a term of years. With the development of more dependable techniques in the art of examination, the time seemed to be ripe for this action. The first year of the humanities course will be offered during the year 1937-38. The second part, Humanities B, dealing chiefly with the fine arts and music, will also be offered as an elective, but not as a prescribed course until a year later. The first part of the course is devoted to literature, and will be presented in small sections by a staff of teachers remarkable not alone for their competency to offer a course as difficult to present as this course is bound to be, but for the enthusiasm and devotion with which they have attacked all of the complexities inherent in the • situation. Course No Cook's Tour The Chairman of the Subcommittee has said: Perhaps the best way of describing the new Humanities A course which will be required of all freshmen beginning next fall, is to point out certain things which it is not, and which it is not intended to be, and which, in so far as things can be arranged in advance, there is no possibility of its becoming. It is not, in the usual and objectionable sense of the term, a ""survey"" course. It is not, and is not intended to be, a Cook's tour through the history of European literature and philosophy. It is not a series of tidbits from the Great Books of the World designed to insure general culture. The positive aim of the course is perhaps adequately described in the first sentence of the announcement in the Columbia College catalogue. ""The aim of this course is to develop in the student literary taste and judgment, as well as habits of philosophical analysis, through a careful acquaintance with a series, in more or less chronoligacl order, of the outstanding masterpieces in the literature and philosophy of the European tradition.""The list of authors to be read includes Homer, the Greek dramatists, Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Hobbers, Spinoza, Dante, Moliere, Shakespeare, Milton, Fielding, Cervantes, Montaigne, and Goethe. The list does not pretend to be exhaustive, but is representative of the greatest. There will be no handbooks, outlines, or texts about these authors or books; instead there will be a careful reading of these masterpieces, followed by class discussion aimed at a sharpening of the powers of literary criticism and philosophical understanding. There are many serious problems incident upon the adoption of this course, which is prescribed in addition to the course in Contemporary Civilization and the necessary work in science and the languages. The first year of college will be filled up with courses demanding a tremendous amount of reading. Whether the burden will be too much for slow readers is a question that must be carefully observed. In any case this program necessitates more careful diagnostic and remedial work for those who have not learned to read rapidly. It will also require constant vigilance to discover those boys for whom this program is ill adapted. It is hoped that there will be few such cases, but we cannot be certain until the course is actually under way. Few Upper College Changes Although it is too early to be certain as the exact recommendations concerning the Upper College, a preliminary report which was discussed at a Faculty smoker in April indicates their tendencies. Unless all signs fail, the substance of the changes in the Upper College will not involve any drastic modification of the requirements for the degree. All of these prescribed courses would normally be completed while the student is still in the Lower College. The new recommendations will have to do with the ways and means of helping each individual student to determine where he had better throw the emphasis in his advanced work and how to do it. It is so be hoped that the abilities, interests, and ambitions of each student will be so clearly analyzed with the help of appropriate members of the staff that with a minimum of rules each student will be able to decide what he should do. This will mean an extension of our advisory system, especially for the Upper College. It will not mean that someone will make the sudent's decisions for him, in accordance with some rule laid down by the adviser, but that with friendly assistance the student will be enabled to make his own decisions with more knowledge of facts and conditions than he otherwise could have done. The ambition of the adviser should be to perform the service of the wise man of long ago of whom it was said, ""His words make men to stand upon their feet."" Just how this extension of the advisory system will be worked out remains to be seen, but the fact that the various departmental officers recognize the importance of this attitude is excellent promise of its success.(To Be Continued)"
302,College Catalogue Appears Annual Announcement Lists Many Course Changes; Peliminary Registration Begins Next Monday,3 April 1941,"Annual Announcement Lists Many Course Changes; Peliminary Registration Begins Next MondayA sure sign of spring, in the guise of the ""Announcement of Columbia College"" appeared on the Campus yesterday. And with it came the announcement of preliminary registration dates—April 7 to May I—for all students in Columbia College. Appearing in the traditional format, the catalogue brings news of a considerable number of changes in many of the well-established courses now given. A summary ofthe revised admission require- ~ ments, in effect next year, is included for the benefit of prospective students. Humanities B, Sophomore course in music and art, comes in for one of the major changes. The course has been expanded to give three points of credit, instead of two. Students whose names begin with the letters A to L will study ""Masterpieces of Fine Arts"" during the winter session and ""Masterpiece of Music"" in the spring term. For those included in the M to Z category, the reverse procedure will be in effect. New Course Mathematics 72 brings the theory of relativity to Columbia for the first time. Taught by Professor P. A. Smith, the course, entitled ""Space and Time"" is open to all who can present Calculus as a prerequisite. Major changes have also taken place within the English department. English C3-C4, prescribed for Sophomores, will be given during class period for the first 7 weeks of each session with % point credit. Two maturity credits have been added to English 2, a composition course. A survey of American literature, with Professor Mark Van Doren, has been added, while Comparative Literature 17 and Professor Raymond Weaver's ""Interpretation and Criticism"" have been eliminated for the year. Professor Irwin Edman's popular winter session lectures on moral philosophy have been expanded to include the Spring session, with discussions of religion and art added."
303,THE OFF-HOUR Noted Authority Previews Humanities B for Freshmen,1 May 1941,"Noted Authority Previews Humanities B for FreshmenIn order to acquaint Freshmen from""M"" to ""Z"" with the type of work they will study in Humanities BIR and for instruction of those of the student body who are not Freshmen from""M"" to ""Z"", the following brief discussion of the Bach cantata has been prepared by a noted authority. At a very early age, Johann Sebastian Bach evidenced a great talent for music. He had played before all the crowned heads of Europe by the age of six, but at seven and a half he lost all interest in music and took to drink. Growing despondent over the bombardment of Vienna by Napoleon, he became deaf and died at the age of fourteen. He was buried in a pauper's grave and was quickly forgotten. His short period of musical activity has led some authorities to suspect that Bach himself did not write all of the compositions ascribed to him, which number many thousand. Some attribute them to K.P.E. Bach and others to his fourth cousin, -I.A.L. Bach. This, had led to the famous musical controversy: Was Bach, Bach or was Bach, Bach? Bach's cantata in F sharp minor, the Kreutzer cantata, is scored for clavichord, contrabassoon and the usual number of alto Saxophones. It is performed in this manner by the Society of Ancient Instruments in a fine album put out by the Okeh people. Dr. Leopold Stokowski in his famous transcription of the cantata, has disturbed some purists by substituting three musical saws and a Swiss Bell Ringer for the clavichord. He claims that this orchestration makes it more adaptable for performance by marching bands. It may be noted that Dr. Stokowski, renowned for his innovations, has discarded his podium for conducting Bach cantatas and leads his men while mounted on a pogo stick. Some conductors frequently add a recorder to the orchestra, which may be heard along with two assessors and a Commissioner of Deeds. The three movements of the piece are marked Allegro, Andante con Brio and con Carne (with Beans). While it is in traditional 18th century rhythm, the 17/9 th or Conga rhythm, one may discern while listening carefully to the second movement a brilliant use of the Boogy-Woogy base. If this article has whetted your appetite for music, go to the Medical Office and make an appointment with the resident alienist. There is nothing that a good rest won't cure —or at least that's what the doctor told us. O.H."

305,Change CC-B,13 April 1942,"Senior polls are hardly ever accurate reflectors of stu- 1 dent opinion, but it is undoubtedly true that when, year in and year out, Columbia's graduates put their finger on Contemporary Civilization B as the worst course in the College, they are mirroring a widespread attitude among College students. One criticism frequently levelled against the course is that some of the material, even though only a few years old, is still dated when considering contemporary problems. To a large extent, this condition has been corrected through the revised text and the introduction of new source readings. The major fault with the course, however, is not its content, but the fact that, for a large number of undergraduates, it is a sheer waste of time. A student who intends to major in either history, economics, government or sociology should not be compelled to take six points of material which he will certainly cover thoroughly in his major field. For other students who do not intend to do any work in the social sciences, CC-B should still be kept compulsory, though with constant revisions in its content. Our suggestion is simple: Place CC-B on the same basis as Humanities B, where a number of courses in cultural and literary fields may now be substituted. For example, a student might fulfill his CC-B requirement by substituting Economics 7-8, Economics 9-10, Economics 15-16, Economics 25-26 (the last two economic history courses) ; Government 5-6 or either seminar; History 9-10 (American Republic), History 47-48 (Colloquium in American Civilization), or History 181-182 (Economic and Cultural History of the U. S.). Aside from the important point that such a revision in requirements would enable a student to start earlier on his major field of study, present war demands for highly accelerated programs must be considered. Six points of wasted time mean a great deal to students who are trying to get as much as possible into the shortest possible time. We hope the Committee on Instruction and the Faculty will give serious consideration to this proposal. Immediate introduction of the plan, to become effective next year, is both possible and desirable."
306,Steeves Committee To Call For Changes In College Curriculum Final Report Be Submitted To Faculty Steeves Indicates Trend To Increase In Required Courses,30 March 1945,"Final Report Be Submitted To Faculty Steeves Indicates Trend To Increase In Required CoursesThe Committee on Post-War Planning, special Faculty Commission appointed to investigate and to recommend changes in the Columbia College post-war curriculum, is now entering the final stages of its study, revealed Chairman Harrison Steeves/ Professor of English, early last week. It is expected that a final report will be printed and submitted•>to the Faculty for revision and approval late in the Spring. Steeves, breaking a long silence on Committee action, stressed the fact that, as yet, no definite proposals have been adopted on any phase of College life examined by the Committee. He asserted, however, that the dominating trend was to an increase of required subjects, probably an extension of Physical Education and English Composition , into the Junior and Senior years. Language requirements and the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities 'B' courses will also undergo radical changes. Preliminary work for the Committee on Post-War Planning was handled by a group of specialized sub-committees. Reports from these bodies have already been submitted to the main organization, but no definite information on their contents can be released until they are modified and integrated into a general program. The Committee on Post-War Planning has been meeting continuously since July, 1943. Originally formed to provide a blueprint for returning veterans, the Committee completed its first task in September of that year. Included in the September report was also a recommendation to appoint a fulltime Committee on College Plans. The original Faculty Committee continued in this capacity. Commenting upon the activities of the groups, Dean Nicholas McKnight stated: ""I have been greatly impressed by the thoroughness and vision with whichProfessor Steeves' Committee and the various sub-committees functioning under it have gone about their work. The final report will probably be a major milestone in the evolutionary development of the Columbia College program of study. ""The curriculum which our present students know began to take form immediately after the first World War and was steadily enriched throughout the following two decades. The studies which are now taking place and the recommendations which will come out of those studies represent a resumption of the virtually unceasing re-examination of the curriculum which was interrupted by the full impact of war conditions. I am convinced that our men now on leave for service will return to an even better College than the one that they left."""
307,College Announcement Ready As Pre-Registration Begins Greatly Illustrated Catalogue Is First Revision in Fifteen Years,8 April 1947,"Greatly Illustrated Catalogue Is First Revision in Fifteen YearsThe Announcement of Columbia College for 1947-48 is available starting today in the Secretary's Office, Low Library. For the first time in fifteen years, the Announcement has been revised. Even the cover has been changed, and sixteen pages of photographs, all of recent origin, are included in the 163 page book, whose contents reflect ""ACollege Program in Action."" With the appearance of the Announcement, the College begins the period of preliminary registration for next year. Every College student must file a registration blank with the Registrar by Monday, May 5 or pay a late fee of $3. Below are a few points concerning preliminary registration and the program for next year: 1. There will be no authorized substitutes for Humanities B starting in 1947-1948. It is likely that the Committee on Instruction will approve only those substitutions where the individual clearly has previously mastered the material of the course. , Students Distributed 2. Sectioning in Humanities B in 1947-1948 will be by initials, with students whose names begin with A to L registering for Humanities FBI in the Winter Session and Humanities MB2 in the Spring Session. Students whose names begin with M to Z will register for Humanities RMB2 in the Winter "" Session and Humanities RFBI in the Spring Session. It is hoped that this arrangement will distribute the students equally, which is important in these courses because of the visual aids used and the special rooms required. 3. In view of the dropping of Economics 17-18, students electing the professional option program in Business are now required to complete in Columbia College before enrolling in the School of Business either Economics 19-20 or Economics 25-26 in addition to Geography 1-2 and Economics 7-8. To Train Four Years 4. All N.R.O.T.C. students must take four years of Physical Education. Junior and Senior NROTC students who have completed Physical Education A and B may elect Physical Education X which will permit considerable flexibility in scheduling participation hours. Veteran civilian students may also elect this course if they have passed the proficiency test in physical education. 5: Unless permission is obtained from the Department of Naval Science NROTC students must keep Friday from 2 to 4 free for drill and other Naval assignments. 6. Two new courses have been added to the curriculum in addition to those listed in the Announcement: History 7-8, Europe in the Middle Ages, 300-1500 taught by Dr. Clagett, and Humanities 47, Voltaire, the Humanist and Critic, taught by Professor Kinne. 7. Liberal Arts students will no longer retain that title, but must choose either specialization in the humanities or specialization in the social studies."
308,Greek Gods Are Haunting Freshmen For 12th Time,4 October 1948,"By MAX FRANKEL '52First to hit the ears of every entering freshman is the phrase ""forty books a year!"" And there follow the stories of the dreaded Humanities! One hundred pages of Rousseau overnight. Whew! Over ten years now freshmen have been reading the classics at near breakneck speed in Humanities A, while the Sophomore continuation of the same course provides study of the two other major art forms, music and art. Early in 1934, a group of Columbia professors who had already made educational history by promoting the famed CC courses, plotted in clandestine fashion for the Humanities A and B. They felt, as they had in the case of the Contemporary Civilization courses, that a college which granted a liberal arts degree should produce educated men; and that as such these men should have a taste of the arts. After their proposal had been rejected once, at long last, on September 23, 1937 freshmen found Humanities A and B among their degree requirements. The course was a perfect complement for the already famedCC's. For as the student studied the philosphy, history and economics of civilizations and institutions he now was introduced, concurrently, to that society's most representative writers, painters, architects, sculptors, musicians, and dramatists. Humanities A reading ranged from Homer to G'oethe and listening in Humanities B from Bach to Stravinsky; while fine arts classes observed structures patterned after the Roman Pantheon or current New York showings. Instructors for the course were snatched from the English Philosophy, History, Classics and Modern Languages departments. It was the second time that Columbia proved to the education world that inter-department cooperation could and should be achieved. The courses which are given to groups of from 20-25 students, boast a series of short quizzes and several essay tests. To refresh some memories, or to impress some others, a sample: Did Herodotus admire Egypt, despise Egypt , never go to Egypt, or die in Egypt? ""Forty books a year!"" Whew."
309,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Humanities B Classes Found Too Large for Discussions,2 February 1949,"Humanities B Classes Found Too Large for DiscussionsTo The Editor: The two year Humanities sequence is intended to be a discussion course, but it seems that the intention has been woefully neglected. Most of the classes in Humanities B are too big and they tend to become lectures. This is in sad contrast in the comparatively small Humanities A classes in which everyone could join in the discussion. If anything, the music and fine arts classes should be smaller, because their appreciation is more subjective and requires more expression of the students' opinion than consideration of literature. As soon as an instructor turns to technical terms and forgets the class, copies of the Spectator or any daily paper become the center of attraction.In fields which are frequently unfamiliar to the student, the instructor's attention is necessary and it cannot be obtained in a class of 35 students. Instead of splitting large sections into smaller classes, the Fine Arts Department tries to move students to other less crowded sections, thus causing unnecessary inconvenience. Wouldn't it be simpler to transfer instructors from the less crowded sections into more busy ones, or increase the total number of instructors teaching the course? Smaller sections would make the second part of Humanities much more than the superficial culture course which we are forced to take now. Humanities B student"

There is another suggestion that I would like to offer, this time about the curriculum itself. Would it not be possible to make the Freshman year easier by offering Humanities B before Humanities A ? The difference of the is not as great as the difference in the time that the work of the courses demand, and surely the music of Palestrina and the art of Amiens furnishes more of a cultural continum with the work of CC A than the writings of Aeschyus. Moreover, CC B reading is lighter than CC A, and this leaves the student time to enjoy the reading as well as get it done in time for the quizzes.

311,LION ABOUT LIT Fine Arts Department Trio Compiles History,5 May 1949,"Fine Arts Department Trio Compiles HistoryHISTORY OF WORLD ART by Upjohn, Wingert, and GastonMahler Oxford University Press 560 pages $6.00 Three members of the Department of ■ Fine Arts and Archaeology of Columbia have compiled a SQurce book which will be of great value for introductory courses in painting, sculpture and architecture. Published today, it is the last word in modern book production, with over 500 pages of clear, easily understood text, and 654 large illustrations. These are produced on special paper designed to retain as much of the artistic quality as possible in large scale high speed printing. This history embraces far more than the Humanities B course in the College, including sections on Near Eastern and Far Eastern art. Early Greek and Roman art is also given an important section, with excellent photographs andcorrelated textual material. An entire chapter is devoted to American art and architecture, with large sections devoted to more recent developments in European art. A glossary of technical terms, and an impressive list of suggested readings complete the history. The work meets a self-imposed drawback, as it sets its own objectives too superficially to make a real contribution to understanding of world art. The great sweep of time which the history covers prevents detailed analysis of any but the major trends and periods of art. However since many sections, particularly those dealing with the birth and growth of American Art, traced back to its Colonial origin are not dealt with in many intorductory art courses this book is a valuable addition to any library. It is a must for anyone not intimately acquainted with the development of art, and for all who desire an understanding of art as it appears from an historiacl perspective. It cannot help but seem over-generalized in some aspects, but it succeeds admirably in its stated purpose of its authors. ""We are not presenting an integrated and comprehensive philosophy of art."" the preface states, ""We have, however, given as many concrete examples as possible of the accepted concepts of criticism in our interpretation of the works discussed.""

312,FRESHMAN'S COURSE GUIDE — YOUR PROGRAM THIS YEAR,16 September 1953,"The Columbia College catalogue for this year lists 344 undergraduate courses given in the College. Most of these courses do not concern the average freshman who must make out a program. For those with ordinary high school preparation, there are about 20 courses from which some sort of logical program must be compiled. As a service to the Freshman class, the Columbia Daily Spectator has printed on this page information of a more detailed nature than is ordinarily found in the College calatolgue about these courses as well as some general information which may help new students in the composition of a program.The College Catalogue The College catalogue contains an alphabetical listing of all courses offered by the College Faculty. Almost all courses which are open to freshmen are found in this listing. Course titles preceded by the letter 'R' (which means ""reverse"") are given in inverted order, that is. the first half of the year course is given in the second half of the school year, the spring term and vice versa. Courses preceeded by the letters, G.S., are given under the School of General Studies and special permission must usually be obtained for these courses. Sections Are Divided The sections of the various freshman courses differ only in respect to the time at which they are given. These sections are usually redjvided into sub-sections for smaller classes. In most such courses, there is little way in which you can 'pick' your instructor. Air Science 101 Around the world in two semesters with a dashing Air Force Captain who interprets a standard geography text, ""World Political Geography."" The junket spends time on Russia, the NearEast and other interesting places. Particular attention is paid to recent governmental and population problems. The course requires about three hours of preparation a weeek and is taught in lectures followed by five minute question-and-answer periods. Five-minute short-answer quizzes are given about once a week in addition to a rigorous mid-term and final, which, among other things, tests map reading and drawing. Few, if any, take this course without being members of the AFROTC unit. Astronomy 1 Astronomy is a deep, tough and —for those who study hard—a very rewarding course. What with highly complicated math work involved, many quizzes, and extensive memorization, the course is rarely recommended for those who are not truly interested in the matter. Botany 1 Most .of those students taking the Botany course don't intend to be botanists—they are merely fulfilling their science requirement, and Professor Edwin Matzke, the department head and instructor tells you so the first time he sees you. Everyone in the class is immediately won over and from there on it's Prof. Matzke's show. The class itself meets three times a week, including a two hour lab, 4 hours in all. Most of thework for the course is done in class with the emphasis on lab work, centering about microscope work, plant classification, etc. Notetaking is very important. Chemistry Chemistry is a subject best reserved for the budding scientists and avoided by those looking for an easy way out of their science sequence. There are three elementary chemistry courses open to the Freshman depending upon their previous training in the field. For those who have done well on their chemistry placement exam Chem 9 is a fine course. It not only covers the introductory inorganic material but also includes work in qualitative analysis and exempts the student from the regular qualitative analysis course, Chem 11. Chem 9 is not an easy course by any means and will require a good amount of work. Chem 3 Available Chem 3 is a regular inorganic chemistry course intended for those who had one year of high school chemistry and who either do not want to do the work of Chem 9 or have not rated high enough on the placement exam. For those who missed taking high school chem, Columbia has come to their rescue with Chem 7. This course involves more time than Chem 3, and may, in fact, seem like quite a prodigious undertaking to the neophyte chemist. He is relieved of his added burden the following term, however, when he moves in with the former Chem 3 students to take the Chem 4 course. Contemporary Civilization This is a two-year sequence required of all students in Columbia College. The course is taught by an inter-departmental committee of the faculty. Sections usually do do not have more than 20 or 30 members. The proportion of lecture and discussion will vary from section to section with the instructor, but the student should count on being prepared to a greater or lesser extent in discussion on the various readings. There are two texts for the course: the source book, and the ""readings,"" the emphasis is on the source reading. They vary in length but a night's work is usually about 20 to 30 pages of reading, usually fairly heavy reading. Papers Required In addition to the readings and class discussions, the course includes papers of medium length and, of course, a mid-term and final. These have invariably been of essay type and ordinarily there is not particular emphasis on historical facts and figures. In general, the tenor of the course is determined by the individual teacher and his field of interest. Students planning to continue work in the social studies would do well to take C.C.in their first year since many, if not most, courses in history, government, etc., have this course as a prerequisite. English English A1 is required of all students in Columbia. This course, as might be expected, consists mostly of the writing of themes, about one a week on the average, and some class discussions. What happens in the classroom usually varies widely from section to sec-tion. Sections are even smaller than those normally of C.C. or Humanities. Geology A1 A very interesting course and a fine way for non-science majors to fulfill part of their math-sci-ence requirement, especially if they prefer not to spend hours in the lab. Professor A. K. Lobeck teaches the first half of the course which includes general geology. Slides and Professor Lobeck's excellent drawings help a lot. Professor Taylor teaches the second half of.the course which goes into somewhat more details. The laboratory sections are taught mostly by geology graduate students, and are usually quite good and interesting. Health Education A1 This course tries to do a lot for the freshman. In addition to solving problems of sex and sociability, it raises new broblems and questions. For those taking the course and its purposes seriously, there is a lot to be learned and gained. The course, run on a small class basis, makes ample use of student discussion, films, and guest lecturers. The teaching by fairly young, understanding instructors, is very liberal in every respect. There are a set of rather interesting readings to be done, and some kind of project must be completed. Humanities The Humanities two-year sequence is part of the required ""core"" curriculum. The first year of Humanities need not necessarily be taken before Humanities B. They may even be taken concurrently and those wishing to spread the Lower College requirements over three years often postpone the entire sequence for a year. In fact, slow readers would be well advised to use some such ar-rangement and not take C.C.and Humanities A at the same time. Humanities A is primarily a reading course, which begins with the classics and ends in the 19th century. About one book a week is the assignment and these may run from 60 pages of Greek plays to several hundred pages of Don Quixote. The emphasis in on class discussions of the material read. In addition, there is a regular weekly quiz, usually multiple-choice, on l the book due for that day, thus ostensibly assuming that nobody falls too far behind. Class discussions are made possible 15V very small classes, usually around 20 or so. Humanities B Humanities B is divided into two parts: Humanities FBI, covering fine art, and Humanities MBI, music. Both these courses are taught in small sections. The Fine Arts course makes extensive use of all sorts of visual aids: slides, drawings, museum trips, etc., to trace the development of art from the pyramids to Picasso. No previous knowledge of art appreciation or technical terms is assumed but these are learned during the term. Reading for the course is fairly minimal. Papers may vary slightly from section to section, but all are required to take several museum trips. Use Recordings The Humanities Music course, as might be expected, makes extensive use of the Music Department's phonograph record collection. In addition to class work, there are listening sessions under the tutelage of graduate music students which are quite helpful. Reading is minimal. For those interested, the music room in the college study, (in back of the card catalogue), has phonographs with earphoftes but its selection of records is fairly limited. Those on campus may make use of the Humanities music programs broadcast on WKCR which are integrated in varying degree with the course. Towards the end of the term, the whole week of classical music broadcasts is given over to 'cram session.' Languages Proficiency in at least one foreign language is required of each Columbia graduate. The basic sequence in each case is a two year course, labelled, for instance, French Al, A 2, 81, 82. In general, the Al, A 2 courses, which meet five times a week, require 30 minutes of homework every night, and weekly quizzes are given. The work in the 81, B2 courses concentrates less on the fundamentals and more on reading and speaking the language. In the French course this aspect is taught very well by the use of recordings, tape recorders, special pronunciation sessions. Read Great Classics In the German course, the student, after two years of instruction, has a better grasp of reading techniques than of speaking or writing. In this course, however, the great classics of the language are read in the second years; in most of the others the more important works are not introduced until the third-year sequence. Mathematics The mathematics sequence a year of which you will be required to take if you choose not to take both a laboratory science and a non-lab science—begins with tri-gonometry and runs through differential and integral calculus to the most advanced graduate courses, on gamma functions and probability integrals. The usual lower college courses are these: MATHEMATICS Al—Trigonometry. a three point course required if you did not take this course in high school. For this reason, it is given at often inconvenient hours and only in the Winter Session. MATHEMATICS 21A—Analytic Geometry and Differential Calculus, a three point course which will be the math course taken by the largest number of students.: In general, high marks do not, come easily in this subject; many of the instructors develop the theoretical sides of the subject but neglect many of the practical aspects of the subpect. : Between thirty and sixty minj utes of homework, much of ifc routine, is assigned every night; not every teacher will mark it, although it is always corrected, since its primary purpose is to drill the techniques involved. Naval Science 10] The glorious traditions of the United States Navy are sounded in this course. Rigorously cffarting the history of naval power from Bible times to the present, an occasional instructor, who is usually a Lieutenant Commander has been known to stray and tell personal sea tales. The fifty minute sessions are usually given as straight lecture, with little questioning. In addition a short orientation of naval procedures, such as when to salute, is presented before the regular historical analysis weighs anchor the third week of the term. Like air science this course stresses memory of specific historical data, and its tests, about twice a week are of the short-answer nature. The euphemism in the catalogue for marching drill is ""Laboratory."" Physical Education The Physical Education program at Columbia covers three years. The first two years are divided into eight quarters. The student must take two quarters in an individual sport, (such as bowling, tennis), two quarters in a team sport, (baseball, basketball, football) and one quarter in a combative sport (fencing, boxing or wrestling). The two years are rounded out by tlpree quarters of electives. The classes in all sports are a combination of expert instruction and actual participation. They are not, however, drill periods. 'Cuts' Disqualify As in all courses which meet : three times a week, the maximum' unexcused absences, or cuts, al-] lowed per term is five times, with: two latenessness, always recorded in gym classes, counting for one 'cut.' In Phys Ed, however, 12 'cuts,' excused or otherwise, force a student to lose credit for that; term of the course. All medical! excuses, sprained muscles and: such, must be submitted through the Medical Office in Earl Hall. Physics Whether a disciple of Newton, or a relativist in the Einsteinian school, Physics 3-4 will answer your needs admirably. It will not satisfy the pre-Engineering requirements or the requirements for any of the professional fields dealing largely with physics. The course, in its present form, is slanted, heavily, toward the his- : torical side of physics, with great-; er emphasis on general principles | and scientific thinking than on | details of formula manipulation, j"
313,Give It a Try,12 October 1954,"Advocates and opponents of coeducation on the Columbia undergraduate level have rarely been able to find a meeting ground for informed dispute. Those in favor point to generally untested advantages such as intellectual stimulation arising from the heterosexual diversity of opinion; the furtherance of social adjustment; a wider variety of courses open to both Barnard and Columbia College students as the result of pooling the faculty staffs and teaching facilities; and the more profitable utilization of professorial talents in particularly specialized'areas of inquiry where enrollment is wastefully small. Distraction is the hoary bugaboo of coeducation's detractors. Clinging cashmere and dimpled knees, they hold, constitute formidable contenders for the male student's attention in astronomy courses and medieval history seminars. Hence, whatever advantages of diversity may accrue from the mental presence of the Barnard scholars, they do not at all compensate for the lewd mindwandering induced by their physical presence. These detractors will admit, however, that the curricular and financial benefits are potentially substantial and in this light see the feasibility of a restricted plan of coeducation, extending only to certain advanced courses. But what is the status of coeducation on this campus? If we exclude the School of General Studies from the scope of our consideration on the grounds that its student body is approximately eight years'older on the average than those of Barnard and the College, we find about 35 College students taking courses behind the green fence while more than four times that many damsels, although we have yet to discover them, are supposed to be enrolled in our courses. Thus, we have coeducation here, albeit in a vaguely limited, unofficially recognized, and slightly clandestine form; and we hear no clamorous complaints of distraction either from students or faculty. To our knowledge, the opponents of coeducation have yet to produce factual evidence for its allegedly detrimental effects on the learning process. The system's proponents fall back, on the seeming success of similar plans at other institutions, notably the unrestricted coeducational courses at Radcliffe and Harvard Colleges. In order to remove the fruitlessly speculative elements which now serve only to obscure the issues, we recommend the establishment of a formal experiment in coeducation. The proper laboratory would be either in two or three advanced courses, open to students of junior standing or better so as to guarantee a reasonable degree of social maturity; or Humanities B where ""feminine"" interests in music and art could be ably expressed. We further suggest that suitable questionnaires be devised for the students, and that the faculty members in charge of the courses be particularly perceptive individuals who can intelligently report on the implementation of the plan. It seems to us that this quasi-scientific approach is the only sensible way to determine the values of coeducation here."
314,Creative Arts—l,9 December 1955,"The creative arts are well established as both vocations and avocations of stature, and as significant stimulants to both the senses and the intellect. That Columbia University recognizes the importance of the creative arts in modern society is evidenced by the current ambitious project of building a great Arts Center, which ""seems to promise virtually unlimited possibilities for the development of the arts in this country,"" in the words of Curt Reisinger, Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the Center. More immediately, the facilities to be made available suggest some new avenues of development for Columbia College. We hope that the prospect of the Arts Center will provoke a reassessment of the place of the creative arts in the College curriculum. Currently, Columbia College produces few men who go into caree/s in the creative arts,any many who have had little or no touch with these areas of study. Courses in the creative aspects of the arts have a subordinate place in the College curriculum, partly because they are considered to be more technical than intellectual, and partly because of the lack of facilities. For instance, courses in painting and sculpture and in applied music are offered to College students, but with somewhat reduced point credit; and in the Humanities B courses the student need never touch a brush or a key. Let us first consider the case of the general student who comes to the Humanities B courses quite fresh. In order to instill in him an appreciation of the arts, the courses subject him to what Professor William Mitchell of the music department has called ""direct and even crass contact with the monuments of the art."" But is this enough? We suggest that a substantial appreciation must be founded on a familiarity with the language of an art. The man who has performed music understands it better than the merely passive listener. And what better way to appreciate perspective in art than through drawing in perspective, or to understand oil than through painting in oil? Specifically, we suggest that laboratories in conjunction with the Humanities B courses be considered. Of course there would have to be an adjustment to accommodatedifferent levels of talent and previous training ; but in all cases a laboratory would serve to enhance appreciation through increased familiarity with the language, and would probably awaken latent interest in many instances. We feel that such material could be introduced without subtracting from the present content of the courses, for they are now somewhat less demanding of the student than are other three-point courses, for instance their counterpart, the second year of Contemporary Civilization. In music, there would be the problem that some students have not had elementary preparation: they cannot read music. If the training they lack is considered to be of a sub-college nature and not worth the energies of the music department, instruction could be given by students, both graduate and under-graduate, employed as ""Laboratory instructors."" In the Fine Arts Department some thought has, in fact, been given to offering an elective along the lines of the laboratory we suggest. The drawback has been the lack of a place to give the course. The facilities to be made available when we have an Arts Center should correct that difficulty. The other aspect of the problem of the creative arts concerns their place as vocations. We shall deal with this aspect Monday."
315,Two Centuries of Columbia College From a Trinity Church Back Room to a 'Subway Sorbonne',15 March 1957,"From a Trinity Church Back Room to a 'Subway Sorbonne'By Arthur LouisThe second in the line of British Hanoverian rulers issued a special charter on October 3-1, 11754, sanctioning Dr. Samuel Johnson's tiny college in the city and colony of New York. The college was given the name King's College, as a self-imposed tribute to George 11. Today it is called Columbia. Columbia College, nonsectarian throughout its history, is the fifth oldest undergraduate institution of higher learning in the United States. The oldest is Harvard, and that was founded even before Bunyan wrote Pilgrim's Progress. By the charter's stipulations, .King's College was to provide a ""liberal education."" It was not to be a mere trade school, a craft guilS: It was, and is, a repositoryof the liberal arts, where a man may take a long hard look at what his predecessors, scholastic and non-scholastic, thought and made of the world. King's College, its name changed to Columbia College in 1784, when the last traces of British rule were seeping back across the Atlantic, spent its first century in the shadow of dark old Trinity Church, which still stands today north of the Battery near Manhattan's southernmost tip. In 1857, the College shifted to 49th St. at Madison Ave. Soon after its uptown move, during the reign of Columbia President Frederick A. P. Barnard (1864-1&9'7), Columbia sprouted a host of graduate and professional schools, all, more or less, functioning to this day. Little Columbia College becamestifled in this melange of brother schools, and very nearly met a tragic end. Barnard himself doubted the sagacity of retaining the College of Liberal Arts. He felt that the modern trend in education was a reversion to ultra-specialization. Fortunately the earnest efforts of the next Columbia President, Seth Low, prevented Barnard's near mistake. Lofw took the College to permanent quarters on Morningside Heights, where it displaced the31oomingdale Insane Asylum. The Golden Age of the College, ;he true heritage of Columbia ;oday, had begun. When Lowwas elected Mayor of New York City, in 1901, he was succeeded by Nicholas Murray Butler, who, with Dean Howard Van Amringe, initiated a flock of familiar Columbia institutions. Between 1904 and 1927, the three undergraduate dormitories were completed. Hamilton Hall, the seat of liberal arts study at Columbia, was erected in ISO?. The Van Am statue and quadr rangle were posthumous tributes to the Dean, who died in 1915. In 1901, Jester, the humor magazine, joirred Spectator (founded 1877), and Barnard College (1&89) in the collective effort to stimulate the male undergraduate. In 1304, Van Amringe started the Faculty Advisory System for Columbia College students. For over forty years Butler led and enriched Columbia. He was almost single-handedly responsible for most of the buildings on campus. There was meager space for them, hut t'hey were sorely needed, and the facile tongue and countless contacts of ""Nicholas Miraculous"" exhumed the funds for their construction. Appropriately, the library dominating the south end of the campus was named after him. In lQ'lO, Contemporary Civilization A was added to the Columbia curriculum by Dean Herbert Hawkes. In 1928, a second year sequel, C.C. B, became a requirement. These, coupled with the Humanities A (1937) and Humanities B '(1947) courses, form the ""core"" of the Columbia liberal arts education. A man named Eisenhower became Columbia University President in 1948, and when he decided to look for another job in Washington in 1952, he was succeeded by present President Grayson Kirk. In 1950, Government Professor Lawrence Chamberlain replaced Harry Carman as Dean of the College. Simultaneously a new post, Dean of Students, was created and assigned to Nicholas M. McKnight, whose retirement last semester vacated the position. Throughout its two centuries ■Columbia College has hosted such diverse notables as: revolutionaries Alexander Hamilton and John Jay; statesman De Witt Clinton; Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo, one of the younger of the ""nine old men""'; artist Rockwell Kent; diplomate V. Wellington Koo; publishers Simon and Schuster, Knopf, Bennett cerf. Mozart's operatic librettist Lorenzo da Ponte, the immortal Philosopher John Dewey, and three members of the multi-talented Van Doren family 'have tried their hands here as faculty members. The history of Columbia College is a long, proud, and full history. The College gives indication of forever responding satisfactorily to the exhortation in the second verse of the Alma Mater: ""Long may Columbia stand, honored throughout the land, our Alma Mater grand, now and for aye . . ."""
316,"Freshman Year Curriculum: Understanding Your Program Humanities, Science, CC Are Required",17 September 1957,"Humanities, Science, CC Are RequiredA seemingly inoffensive bluejacketed book of some 170 pages holds the key to an undergraduate career at Columbia. It is the college catalog, which describes nearly all of the courses available to the Columbia College student. Over 350 courses are designed for students eager to learn. How- , - ever, only a few of these choice pickings are available to fresh'men. They form the foundation •'for- further explorations in the -■upper-class ye^rs. In order to further aid the i freshman in his choice of courses : 'Spectator will now present a I '-capsule View of the required j -program. Core Courses The core of the liberal arts program are the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities se.quences. Together 'these courses present a picture of the develop- . ment of western man —his his'tory, literature, philosophy, musuc and fine arts. Contemporary Civilization Affectionately called CC by the initiated, Contemporary Civilization is a required two year . sequence of courses which present a history of the major polit,ical and philosophical ideas of Western civilization. Classes are fairly small discussion groups, meeting with a teacher selected .from any one of several departments, including history, philosophy, government and economics. Readings come from two texts, a book of source material containing excerpts from the world's ■ important documents and a historical commentary. Source readings are emphasized. The amount of reading varies but a night's .work generally consists of 20 to 30 pages of fairly difficult material. In addition to readings and class discussions, the course includes papers of medium length to be written at home. Three exams and a final are required. Tests are usually the essay type, emphasizing interpretation of the ■ materials, rather than memorization of historical facts. Humanities The first year of the two year Humanities sequence is a study of the classics of literature and philosophy from the early Greeks to the 19th century. A different work is read each week and the length varies from ' 100 to 600 pages, with the average assignment being about 250 pages. The books are discussed in small classes led by a teacher from the English, philosophy or language departments. There is a weekly quiz designed to test whether the student has kept up with the readings. The midterm, a final and two take-home papers, however, are the most important factors in determination ■ of grades. The major tests are all = essay-type exams. Humanities B The second year of the Humanities sequence is divided into i a study of the great- works of-music ana fine arts. They may be taken before, after or concurrently with the literature course. The Fine Arts course makes extensive use of visual materials, such as slides. The amount of reading is very small. The development of art from • the Greeks to the moderns is studied in class as well as on various museum trips. The student's newly acquired knowledge is tested by means of a midterm, a final and two short papers. Undergraduates are introduced to the masterpieces of music in the Humanities music course. Class- work consists of listening to and discussing great musical works, from the middle ages to the modern period. Homework largely consists; of listening assignments in the library listening room. Reading is minimal. Students are tested by a midterm and final, both of which include identification of musical works played on the phonograph. Two short reports on concerts attended are also required.Justus Buchler Professor of Philosophy —Instructor of CC."
317,Integration,4 May 1960,"With the announcement that freshman English and Humanities Al classes in the new undergraduate division of the School of Engineering will be integrated with those of the College, the year-old program has taken an important step toward preserving the liberal arts ""core"" content in its curriculum. The School of Engineering has recognized that an emasculated liberal arts sequence for its undergraduates would imperil the success of its entire program. Similarly, it is to the advantage of undergraduate engineers not to be segregated from students with divergent interests and different professional plans. The School feels that the freshman work load is too heavy to bear the strain of Humanities A 2. The engineers will also continue to take a separate three-term C.C. sequence, ostensibly because it would be difficult to staff an integrated program without the use of part-time faculty. It is unfortunate that further steps toward integration have not been taken. The . School of Engineering has already ruled out Humanities B as a requirement; it would be sad if as valuable a course as Humanities A 2 should also be abridged or discarded. The same is true of Contemporary Civilization. Besides its own version of C.C. A, the School now offers a one-term condensation of C.C. B. As long as the eventual disposition of Columbia College's C.C. B course remains in doubt, it would be wise for the School of Engineering to shun participation. But C.C. A should be integrated immediately, with every effort exerted to staff it with full-time faculty members. Both Humanities A 2 and C.C. A are too central a part of a full education to be watered clown for the sake of more exhaustive specialization on the part of the engineers."
318,New SB Looks to Committees And New Members for Plans,10 October 1960,"By Andrew KrulwichThe Board of Student Representatives has taken on a new look after only two meetings. While last year's Student Board, under Chairman William Goodstein '60, was interested in defining Board'sstructure, the 196061 edition is turning ad hoc to its own membership and to committees for special projects. At last Wednesday's meeting a number of those projects were discussed. Sophomore representative Thomas Homburger, who had been asked to investigate the running and the effectiveness of the Freshman Orientation Lectures, reported several changes that the Dean's Office has instituted. Although freshmen are expected to attend the lectures, now open to the public, the roll will not be taken. SB members will attend some of the lectures and offer suggestions for improvement to the Deans. Moving into the academic sphere, Board set up a committee, chaired by Fred Weiss '61, to organize a Columbia-ißarnard Fine Arts Lecture Series. According to (Board Chairman David M. Blicker, the lecture will ""broaden and expand"" the Humanities B courses. As part of Board's drive to recruit freshmen interested in student government, SB vice-chair-man Joseph Lane announced that the Freshman Steering Committee will be organized for the Bush and the forthcoming freshman elections, . ."
319,Curriculum Will Undergo Modifications,18 September 1962,"By Andrew B. SchultzColumbia's general education program, though firmly established for many years as among the country's earliest and best, will undergo some experimentation during the undergraduate career of the Class of 1966. A two-yea»r program of Contemporary Civilization was reviewed by a faculty committee in 1961. The committee suggested a three-year suspension of the muchcriticized interdepartmental CCB course, which attempted to cover the political, economic, and social theories of the twentieth century. Many students believed that the course was too general to be useful, and teachers deemed the scope of the course too broad to be adequately taught by a single in-structor. In the fall of 1961, a new series of departmental offerings was substituted for the oi# COB course. courses in history, government, economics, sociology and anthropology were made available for second year students. This program, now going into its second year, will be evaluated this year. The OCA course, a full-year study of philosophical trends from the medieval era to the nineteenth century, will remain intact. An advanced course in English A will be instituted this year in response to calls for a more sophisticated approach to challenge outstanding freshmen. The course, called ""Introduction to Literary Study,"" will be a half-year offer-ing, open to students with high scores on the advanced placement tests. Those who satisfactorialy pass the literature course will be exempted from the traditional English A full-year course which aims at bolstering basic language skills such as grammar, spelling, and expository writing. Plans to extend the foreign language requirement from two to three years have been approved by the Committee on Instruction, the College's highest curriculum unit. But final action has been deferred, at least until next year. This means that members of the Class of '66 will fulfill the language requirement if they complete a fourth-term course with a grade of B- or better, or a fifth-term remedial offering with a passing grade. It is expected that . the toughened three-year standard willbe adopted within the next two years, pending further reevaluation of the over-all College program. Addition of a third-year to the language requirement is necessitated by advances in secondary school instruction and better preparation by incoming freshmen before they enter Columbia. Humanities A, a year-long study of world literature from Homer to Dostoevski, and Humanities B, consisting of two separate one-se-mester introductory offerings in the fields of art and music, will continue to be integral facets of the College's general education program. No serious criticisms of the courses have been expressed in recent years, but an interdepartmental faculty group has been appointed to look into the Humanities program. The committee, chaired by Associate Professor ofHistory Fritz Stern, will -report by mid-1963. Perhaps the most controversial requirement in Columbia College is the two-year science program. Four semesters of courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, psychology, astronomy, and geology are currently required. Students may select two full-year courses in different sciences or two years of study in one scientific field. Last March, John G. Palfrey, former dean of the College, proposed a new program of courses in the history of science. A committee headed by Higgins Professor of Physics I. I. Rabi was formed to develop a series of courses. No courses, however, will be offered in the coming year. A faculty spokesman explained that specialists in the history of science are few, and it will take time to implement a well-coordinated program at Columbia. The establishment of a department of science history will not affect the College science requirement in the near future, but such a program might well prompt serious discussion of the value of technical science courses for the liberal arts major."
320,Humanities A Staff Need Not Accept Faculty Proposals,9 January 1964,"The Columbia College faculty has forwarded several recommendations to the Humanities A staff which, if accepted, would make major changes in the basic fresh-man-year course. The proposals suggest possible ways of strengthening the Humanities A course through use of occasional large lectures, critical essays, and special sections for students who already have read most of the works used in the course. Dean David B. Truman explained Tuesday that the Humanities staff is under no compulsion to accept the recommendations. Instead, they are offered for the staff's consideration without any implication of approval by the faculty. The recommendations were presented to the faculty in December by the Committee on Instruction which had acted upon a report submitted by a special Committee on the Humanities chaired by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern. The faculty recommended that the Humanities staff: • ""Arrange a small number of lectures during the semester in such a way that all sections meeting at the same hour"" could occasionally hear an instructor ""especially competent on the particular subject."" • Select ""in each semester two books [to] receive more intensive and extensive examination. This would be accomplished in part by adding . . . one or two critical essays or other ancillary works . . . and by giving one or two more hours to the work and the secondary materials so chosen. It is expected that as a consequence. . . one work will have to be dropped each semester."" • ""Collect one or two volumes of critical readings with an eye to publication so that for every work on the Humanities reading list there should be available at least one critical essay."" These would be drawn from existing literature or commissioned ""from the best possible talents."" • Consider ""establishing one or two sections on an experimental basis for students who have already read a large proportion of the readings and that these sections deal more intensively with a selection of the works."" The Stern Committee had rejected this last recommendation but it was included by the Committee on Instruction. The Committee on the Humanities sent its own recommendations to Dean Truman in a 28-page report. It emphasized that the pro-posals ""are designed to strengthen already strong courses"" and are to oe considered experimental. The report also recommended improvements in the reading lists in the Humanities B courses, Fine Arts and Music. These readings would be aimed at providing background in critical methods and greater historical and cultural context for works studied. The faculty also recommended for consideration: • ""That the Dean and the Chairman of Humanities and C.C. collaborate in an effort to increase the proportion of senior men in each staff."" • ""That the Dean . . . explore the feasibility of arranging for instructors teaching Humanities A for the first time to be permitted to count one section of that course as two-thirds of their normal teaching load."" If approved, the same provision would also apply to C.C. A.David B. Truman"
321,Livelier Arts,12 February 1964,"The Humanities B courses—art and music —may seem very different in content from Humanities A. Yet in the view of the Stern Committee, similar principles underlie similar recommendations. The principles are that more intellectual precision and discipline are needed, and that ""models of discourse"" are desirable. The principal suggestion is for more and better readings. We think both the principles and recommendations are sound, even more clearly so than in Humanities A. Art and music, after all, are ""foreign languages"" to many students. Without a rigorous approach, involving the development of a scholarly and critical attitude, they tend to remain so. ""The student,"" as the Stern Committee says, ""must be given sufficient guidance so that he can move towards a disciplined vision of a work of art."" In the case of both the art and music courses, the committee has concluded, and the staffs have agreed, that superior readings would enhance the understanding of the works studied and also of the principles embodied in them. In each case, it was also found that no existing book could properly perform these functions. For art humanities, the staff will develop a volume with essays that illuminate historical and cultural contexts, and also serve as models of analysis. In music, an analagous collection of readings will be created. As in Humanities A, there is always the possibility that the student will copy his model of discourse rather than learn from it. In Humanities B, however, the risks are small compared with the potential gain. Too many students have no idea at all of how to respond to or understand a work of art. Better readings can help the instructor give them that knowledge. One other recommendation, with regard to art humanities, strikes us as particularly good. It asks that guided visits to museums be an integral part of the course. With New York's abundant artistic resources, it has always seemed strange that discussion between teacher and student should take place only in front of slides of varying quality. The music humanities staff might also consider further ways of exploring New York's artistic resources. The rich program of concerts in the city, in particular, might be used more extensively. The acceptance of the proposals on Humanities B by the respective staffs is promising. The Stern Committee's recommendations will help improve two courses that are worthwhile in their purposes, but could be better in some of their practices. (This editorial is the last of three on the report of the Dean's Committee on the Humanities Courses in Columbia College.)"
322,Special Class In Humanities Not Approved Proposal for Advanced Sections Is Rejected,9 April 1964,"Proposal for Advanced Sections Is RejectedSpecial first year Humanities sections for students who have studied most of the works used in the course will not be offered in the autumn term next year, according to Associate Professor of Greek and Latin Howard N. Porter, chairman of Humanities A. Special sections were discussed but termed ""undesirable"" by the Stern Committee on the Humanities. The Committee on Instruction, however, asked the Humanities staff to consider establishing the special sections in its report on the findings of the Stern Committee in December. Professor Porter said the decision not to offer special sections this fall does not mean such sections will not be offered in the future. He said the Humanities staff believed that there will be so much experimentation in the basic structure of the course this fall that further experimentation should be postponed. He did not rule out the possibility that special sections may be offered in the spring term. The staff decision to reject the Stern Committee proposal for weekly lectures to Humanities classes by instructors ""particularly competent"" in a special area was not affected by the existence of lectures on Humanities A sponsored by the Board of Managers, according to Professor Porter. He said the staff ""approved unreservedly"" of that series, but did not feel it was a part of the course. Professor Porter said that if the Board of Managers decided to drop the lectures, the Humanities Department would probably want to offer similar optional lectures. The Committee on the Humanities, chaired by Associate Professor of History Fritz Stern, also recommended the use of critical essays on the works in the course as secondary material. This suggestion was not approved by the Humanities staff. Also included in the committee's report were recommended changes in ths Humanities B courses, Fine Arts and Music."
323,Humanities B Staffs Study New Readings Committee Calls Present Materials Inadequate,20 April 1964,"Committee Calls Present Materials InadequateBy Michael T. GenglerThe staffs of Music and Fine Arts Humanities are currently collecting materials for new second-year humanities textbooks, in line with the recent recommendations of the special committee on the humanities courses chaired by Professor of History Fritz Stern. The present reading assignments were found inadequate by the Stern Committee, which suggested that each staff ""collect and commission"" a collection of readings for its course. The recommendations of the Stern Committee on Humanities B were referred ""with favor"" to the staffs in December by the Committee on Instruction. Professor of Art History Everard M. Upjohn, chairman of Art Humanities, said last week that a committee had been appointed ""to collect what material may be appropriate"" for a course textbook. The committee is headed by Saul Levine, an instructor in art history. Professor Upjohn termed the committee's task ""a very longrange undertaking."" He added that the staff has no immediate intention of changing the readings now offered until the committee has finished its work. The chairman of Music Humanities, Associate Professor of Music Jack Beeson, said that the staff had begun talking about a new selection of readings for its course last year, before the Stern Committee had presented its recommendations. He hoped that the new readings would be ready in .mimeographed form for use next year. The readings will consist of composers' letters and essays, as well as critical reviews from various historical periods. Professor Beeson said that the Music Humanities course was being reorganized to give instructors the opportunity to be ""more specific"" in their, discussions of the music. Listening periods will be used for the uninterrupted playing of music. Instructors will discuss overall features of style or organization of specific pieces as theychoose in class. Professor Beeson hoped that there would be ""a minimal concern with background materials"" in regular class hours. The readings will give students a historical background — ""what people have thought about music"" —Professor Beeson said. The Stern Committee made several other recommendations concerning the Art Humanities course. It questioned whether the chronological approach now used was the best/way to conduct the course. Professor Upjohn said that new iristructors are now encouraged to follow the order of the syllabus, which is chronologically arranged,but that as instructors gain experience, they are free to vary this approach. Another recommendation of the committee suggested that supple-mentary classes be scheduled in late afternoons and used for guided museum visits; Professor Up John said that Art Humanities instructors are already expected to conduct at least one such visit each term, and preferably two."
324,Student Group Begins Study Of ROTC Role Members Discuss Value To College's Program,22 October 1964,"Members Discuss Value To College's ProgramBy Kenneth DauberThe Student Academic Affairs Committee has begun a study of the role of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps in the College. Students enrolled in NROTC include, as part of their academic work, courses in naval science which lead to a commission in the Navy or Marines after graduation. At a meeting held early this week, several members of the committee expressed doubt that the NROTC program was consistent with the goals of a liberal arts school. Courses given by the Department of Naval Science were cited as too technical to be taught in the College, as lying more in the province of engineering than liberal arts. Naval Science courses include navigation, naval weapons, naval engineering, and amphibious warfare. Students completing such courses receive full College credit toward an A.B. degree. In addition, NROTC students following the engineering professional option program are exempt from the foreign language requirement and from Humanities B. It was also pointed out that no professor in the Department of Naval Science has a Ph.D. Members of the committee, students chosen at the end of their freshman or sophomore year from the top five per cent of their class, are currently interviewing members of the Naval Science department. A form letter is being sent to colleges throughout the country inquiring about the nature of ROTC at other schools. In recent years, NROTC has been the subject of heated debate. Criticism has centered, however, on the place of techniques of war in the College curriculum. Campus pacifists have picketed the annual NROTC review on College Walk for the last several years. According to Carl Aron '65, chairman of the Academic Affairs Committee, the committee's study will not include the political aspects of the NROTC program."
325,Music Humanities Faculty Approves Pass-Fail Grading,14 March 1969,"By JURIS KAZAThe Music Humanities teaching staff has approved a proposal by the College Committee on Instruction to adopt pass-fail grading in its Humanities B courses next semester, Joel Newman, associate professor of music, said yesterday. According to Vice Dean Thomas S. Colahan, now that the humanities instructors have adopted the suggestion of the Committee on Instruction, the matter will be referred back to the committee for final approval. ""The committee is taking the initiative,"" Dean Colahan said yesterday, ""to put to the test the 'mystical quality' ascribed to pass-fail grading."" Robert Branner, chairman of the department of art history and archaeology, said yesterday that he felt ""pass-fail can be tried in Art Humanities courses next year on an experimental basis."" Professor Newman also said that students in all fourteen Music Humanities sections are being polled on the adoption of pass-fail grading for the current semester. He added that a ""plurality of Music Humanities instructors agreed 'to present the student poll to the Committee on Instruction."" According to Dean Colahan, the Committee's proposal called for giving pass-fail grades ""in the usual manner, with the registrar converting letter grades into a P or F on the student's record."" Dean Colahan termed the Committee's proposal ""a meaningful experiment with a large population"" . He said that individual classes requesting pass-fail grading ""wouldn't prove a damn thing"" be-; cause of the small number of students involved. Recently the teaching staff of English A rejected aproposalfrom . the Committee on Instruction to place half of all freshman composition classes on pass-fail grading this semester."
326,Panel May Urge End to English A,24 February 1970,"By JON GRONERThe College Committee on Educational Policy appears likely to recommend later this spring that English A be abolished as a separate course, that experimental freshman seminars be set up to replace first-year Contemporary Civilization for some students, and that the math-science requirement be .revamned to stress biology and physics. The committee, which has been engaged"" for two months in an intensive evaluation of the curriculum, has not yet made any formal decisions, but interviews with members of the group indicate that a consensus has been reached on several specific points. The group has met at least once a week since mid-December and is discussing various aspects of the curriculum—CCA, Humanities A, the math-science requirement, the upper College major system—one by one, in consultation with members of the various departments. Professor of Russian Robert Belknap, chairman of the sixteen-man group, said yesterday that there is ""no chance* that the committee will recommend increasing academic requirements. He predicted that the group will attempt to ""relax"" requirements so that a student can fulfill them in a number of ways. For example, Professor Belknap i tated that many members of the committee favor setting up several experimental sections of a course that would serve as an alternative to CCA for a number of freshmen. The new course would be taught in a seminar format, with about fifteen students per section. Many members of the committee feel that English-A is unpopular with students and that is does not successfully teach writing skills. They suggest that composition be taught in conjunction with freshman CC or humanities. There is wide agreement on the committee that CCA is unsatisfactory in its present form. However, members disagree on the source of its inadequacies. Some, like Associate Professor of History David Rothman, consider the present syllabus ""intellectuallysloppy"" and claim that students get ""an incredibly confused sense of chronology"" from the course. Other members point to staffing difficulties and student discontent as problems with CCA. The math-science requirement has been the subject ofintense debate within the committee. Sidney Morgenbesser, professor of philosophy, advocated making the requirement considerably more rigorous by specifying such fields of science as physics or biology as necessary to fulfill the requirement. Eventually a compromise was reached; the committee probably will recommend that all the ""poets"" science courses be made more ""intellectually rigorous"" and include at least some physics and biology.According to many committee members, some existing ""poets"" courses, such as elementary geology or astronomy, are so far removed from current research in physics and biology as to provide a misleading idea of science to the non-science major. Geology Clolo,a new course on ""Man's Physical Environment,"" was cited as a science course which stresses physics and biology. The group may also recommend reducing the math-science requirement to one year, but a member indicated yesterday that there is still disagreement on this point within the group. The committee has not yet set a target date for releasing its formal proposals, but members have recently expressed hope that areport will be ready by the end of the end of the academic year in May so that experiments can be set up this September. It is not likely that the committee will recommend any extremely radical proposals, such as the abolition of all academic requirements or the replacement of the entire general education program with a system of distributional requirements. However, Profes-, sor Rothman praised the ""willingness of the committee to tamperwith CC"" and emphasized that major changes may be proposed within the existing academic framework. The committee has not yet formally discussed the second-year CC program, which consists of sixteen courses taught in seven departments. However, Professor Belknap indicated yesterday that the committed may recommend establishing some common approach among the CCB courses. After dealing with the CCB and Humanities B programs, the committee will discuss the upper College. Assistant Professor of Economics Raymond Lubitz said last week that the social science departments, which have undergone much criticism recently, will be considered in the greatest depth. Professor Belknap said yesterday that the committee may recommend that the departments assign more tenured professors to College teaching, but explained that ""it's a question of university priorities, and there's not much the committee can do about this.""Robert Belknap"
327,Panel May Propose End to CCB,14 April 1970,"By JON GRONERThe College Committee on Educational Policy may recommend reducing the math-science requirement to one year and replacing the second year of Contemporary Civilization with a distribution requirement in the social sciences. Interviews with members of the committee last night indicated that these changes are likely to be approved by the body at its weekly meeting tonight, and to be issued as tentative recommendations in a report later this month. Associate Professor of History David Rothman said yesterday, ""I don't think there's much chance that CCB will be continued. I think we'll vote to abolish it."" Another member of the committee indicated that there is strong sentiment in favor of abolishing the CCB requirement because ""students feel so constricted. This will give people a greater sense of freedom of movement."" Donald Frame, professor of French, stated that the educationalpanel is considering replacing the current two-year math science requirement with one compulsory year of natural science and some form of ""skillrequirement"",proficiency in mathematics, a foreign language, or possibly some' skill such as computer programming. Professor Frame also asserted that ""it seems clear"" that CCB will be changed to a distri-* butional requirement,"" he- said. ""The courses are mostly general introductions to the disciplines and cannot really be considered general education courses."" Professor of Physics Richard Friedberg said last night that the math-science requirement, CCB, the foreign language requirement, and Humanities B are all ""up in the air"" and declined to predict what action the committee would take. Members of the committee emphasized that the group did not envision abolishing the actual courses now offered in fulfillment of the. second year of CC. The contemplated change would simply mean that any introductory socialscience course —not necessarily now designated as CC courses —would fulfill the sophomore requirement. At last week's meeting, the six-teen-man panel voted to recommend a radical change in freshman course requirements. This proposal would abolish English A as it now exists and give freshmen the option of taking an eight to ten point course to fulfill their general education requirements. The recommendations of the committee will be circulated late this month for comment and revision among College students and faculty members. It is known that many members of the panel feel that the current CCB courses are not fulfilling the function of general education courses."
328,Panel Asks Distributional Program,29 April 1970,"The College Committee on Educational Policy last night, in a surprise move, voted to recommend to the College faculty that students be required to take at least four semester courses ""in fields remote from their major;"" that either art or music humanities — but not both—be required; that the Contemporary Civilization B requirement be abolished; and that the math-science requirement be reduced to one year of natural science. The four-semester distributional requirement would be the first such program in the College. Under its provisions, for example, science students would have to take four courses of their choice in non-science fields. History majors would have to take four courses outside the social sciences. The group's final decision differed in several respects from the original plan introduced at the meeting by Assistant Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman. TheHoltzman plan had provided for a mandatory year of either language or mathematics, while the version approved by the sixteen-man panel maintained the current language requirement and did not include any requirements which could be fulfilled by mathematics courses,except the tour-semester distributional requirement. The Holtzman plan had allowed literature courses to satisfy the Humanities B. requirement. Under the present plan, only art or music will now do so. Furthermore, the Holtzman plan had provided a two-semester distribution requirement in social science. The committee's proposal states that social science can be used only as an optional way of fulfilling the four semesters outside the major. Robert Belknap, professor of Russian and chairman of the panel, said last night that he expects a final copy of the group's recommendations to appear late this week or early next week. The plan will go before the Col- j lege faculty at its meeting in mid•May and, according to Professor , Belknap, it will be extensively dis-.; cussed beforehand with students i and faculty members. Members of the committee have j indicated that the plan stands a 'good cnance of passage by the faculty. Professor Belknap said last night that the committee had decided at the meeting to require either music or art humanities because of a ""dread of some people's grim determination to restrict themselves to their field."" The chairman indicated that agreement had been reached among nearly all committee members on the proposals ""I can't imagine unanimity among them, but there was apretty heavy consensus,"" he said. The chairman noted that if the proposal were approved,the College requirements beyond the freshman year would be quite similar to those at Barnard. He said this is ""a slight step"" toward cooperation between the two schools. The committee, which will meet four more times this year, is expected to deal with other problems such as the staffing of College courses. ,"
329,Instruction Panel Endorses Pass-Fail for Humanities B,11 March 1971,"By DAN DOLGINThe College Committee on Instruction recommended yesterday that second year humanities instructors continue to grade their course on a mandatory pass-fail basis. Last semester many Humanities B instructors indicated a desire to return to traditional letter grading. Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Robert Randle said last night that the instructional panel convinced the Humanities B faculty ""that it might be a valuable idea to continue the pass-fail experiment for another year."" ""Many people on the faculty feel that all College requirements should be pass-fail,"" Dean Randle added. Dean' Randle, the panel's secretary, claimed that his ""attitude was that the evidence just isn't in yet"" on the effects of grading the music and art humanities courses pass-fail. He indicated that the general question of the College grading system will come up for committee discussion in the near future. The committee also continued its discussion of Professor of Political Science Wayne Wilcox's frequent absence from class, but Dean Randle said that he had ""no comment at all"" on thaf discussion., When the panel is investigating a particular professor, its members refuse to divulge any information pertaining to the investigation, as a matter of policy. Last week Michael Ornstein '71, a member of the Committee on Instruction, claimed at a corn-mittee meeting that Professor Wilcox was absent from his class for over five weeks during the first semester. Instructor of Art History Eugene Santomasso, a Humanities B instructor who received a perfect rating in last year's Course Evaluation Guide, said last night that the pass-fail grading has not greatly affected his section. ""Though the attendance fell a bit more this year than last, as far as I can tell the class went pretty much the same as always,"" commented the instructor. Assistant Professor of Art History Ellwood Parry, who also teaches art humanities indicated in a telephone interview that ""it depends upon the particular class."""
330,Freshman English Seminar To Concentrate on One Work,11 March 1971,"By GARY FRIEDMANThe new English A seminars, which were approved last month by the College faculty, will concentrate on one reading throughout a semester like the current English ClOO3 course, the office of Associate Professor George Stade, departmental representative, revealed yesterday. The new course, which will replace the present two semester, two point freshman composition course, will carry three points and last for only one semester. The seminar was originally partof the proposals of the Committee on Educational Policy, chaired by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap. The course will be taught by an interdepartmental staff structured along the lines of the Humanities A and Contemporary Civilization A staffs. The English office stated that one half of the freshman class will take the seminar during the fall term, and the other half will take it in the spring. The order will be determined alphabetically, as it is for the present Humanities B courses. In addition, remedial sections will be formed for those students who received less than 500 on the Verbal Scholastic Aptitude Test. These sections will be similar to the present freshman English course, which often requires students to write one essay per week on varied topics. Much of the Syllabus is decided by individual instructors. In the present system, a student receiving a score of 700 or more in the verbal SAT is allowed to take a qualifying test for the course English ClOO3, a freshman seminar. Given during Freshman Week, the test usually consists of one essay topic."
331,Class of '29 may roll back time and Sunball,13 April 1979,"By JILL BAUER""HORUM EXPECTA VENEET"" reads the inscription on the Sundial. Translated into English that means: ""Await the hour, it will come."" Students haven't exactly been waiting with baited breath for the return of the dark green granite, 15-ton Sunball on the Sundial, which used to tell the standard time only at noon. It was hauled off to a Bronx junk yard 33 years ago when it developed fissures. But officials confirmed yesterday that the College class of '29, this year's sth anniversary class, is considering the donation of a new Sunball. ""If they (Columbia) want to do it, and if the price isn't too much, we will do it,"" said a member of the committee of the aniversary class. The Sundial, which seems to have been a favored meeting place from the time it was erected, was the gift of the class of '85 on its 25th anniversary. When it was officially presented in May 1914, the Sunball was on the south side of busy 116 th Street (now College Walk), right in front of the huge field stretching from Furnald to Amsterdam Avenue. The class of '85 originally suggested that the Sunball be put i n the middle of 116 th Street, Columbia records show, but they resigned themselves when the city overruled the suggestion as too dangerous. When the Sunball was carted away in December 1946, it does not seem to have been missed, according to records. Returning fromChristmas break in Jar uary, 1947, the staff of Spectator editorialized: ""When we did return to Columbia, we noted with a sigh of aesthetic relief (probably aquired during Humanities B Course) that the abortive and unsightly Sun Dial had been cleared off from the 116 th Street front of the College. We hope that its absence will oe permanent. Somehow, we never attached any sentimentality to the globular mass. None of us are astronomy majors and we never could quite figure out what time it was by referring to the dial. Couldn't we cart down the abandoned Lion now residing on Baker Field and place it on the pedestal where the Dial stood,"" proposed Spectator perhaps toungue-in-cheek. It was only recently that nostalgia began to demand the return of the sunball. About a year ago, the great Joe Mysak warned on these pages, ""President McGill. . . Dean Collery ... the Trustees—l don't want to alarm anyone—but if the Sunball is not restored, you may well have a cause celebre on your hands."" One of the Trustees is on the committee of the class considering the gift of a new Sunball. Maybe someone out there was listening after all.thanks mitch. happy whatever.SUNBALL: Shown here with with the proud class of 1885, the old Sunball, which was junked in 1946, might be returned. The class of 1929 wants to pay for it."
332,C olio quia May No Longer Be Offered,14 April 1999,"By NINA WILLDORF Spectator Staff WriterA 67-year-old tradition at Columbia College is being quietly buried—so quietly, in fact, that administrators are reluctant to talk about it. For many faculty, alumni, and students, the financial reasons being used to justify cutting the Colloquia—Core classes started in 1932 that inspired Literature Humanities —disrupt their notion of what Columbia's educational priorities should be, and create a sense of urgency in trying to save an academic legacy. In the words of famed Columbia College graduate David Denby, this seems to be ""just the wrong way to go."" What are Colloquia? Interdisciplinary, team-taught seminars for qualified upperclassmen, the Colloquia were intendedto be extensions of the Core, giving students the opportunity to explore topics outside of their major in their last two years at Columbia. The Colloquium on Important Books was first introduced in the College during the 1932-33 school year. The two professors teaching the course specialized in differentdisciplines and compiled a reading list with the students, often integrating such fields as English, Philosophy, History, Greek, Latin, Economics, Anthropology, and Political Science. Some of Columbia's most noted professors were the first to teach Colloquia: Jacques Barzun, Lionel Trilling, Mark Van Doren, Moses Hadas, and Raymond Weaver. After the course became more popularamongst both students and faculty, the faculty authorized an expansion of the program, creating a new required sequence: Humanities A and Humanities B (now called Literature Humanities). The Colloquia are one of the few forums at Columbia that promote inter-disciplinary studies. For many seniors who find themselves in large major-specific classes by the end of their four years, the Colloquia have been a rewarding way to round out the Columbia Core experience and reunite with classmates from other disciplines. And because they are the only classes at Columbia College where both faculty and students must apply to participate, the Colloquia provide a rare opportunity to be learning from, and with, people whowant to be there. Some colloquia that have been offered in recent years are ""Development of the Citizen and the Welfare State,"" ""Medicine and Civilization,"" ""Humanity and Human Rights,"" and ""Race and Representation: Jewish identity in Modern European Literatures."" For Justin Shubow, CC '99, who is currently enrolled in the Colloquium, the class fills a void in his philosophy major. ""There's only one seminar in my department, so I don't get a chance to take this sort of class,"" he said. And as for the opportunity to cross the boundaries between disciplines, Shubow said, ""I'm a philosophy major, but I still want to read literature."" J.C. Sylvan, CC '97, who took the Colloquium when he was a student in the College, described it as ""the best thing at Columbia for humanities students."" Students like English major Juliet Ross, CC 00, who had hoped to take a Colloquium next year, are upset at the prospect of losing the Colloquia. ""I am disappointed,"" she said. ""It would help me integrate my studies in the Core and in my major, and would give me a sense of having a more complete understanding of things. I think it will be harder to create that experience for myself without the Colloquium."" Colloquia Today From an administrative economic point of view, the Colloquia are not very cost-efficient; two professors teaching 15 students adds up to what Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen called ""an inefficient deployment of resources."" By not having its own department, the Colloquium Committee does not have a discretionary budget or departmental protection. Without its own budget, the Committee draws on money from either the dean of Columbia College or the vice president of Arts and Sciences, who is responsible for the budgetary decisions for 28 departments of instruction in five schools. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Steven Marcus, CC '49, has a unique vantage point on the issue, having been the first and only person to simultaneously be dean of Columbia College and vice president of Arts and Sciences, from 1992 to 1995. In 1995, Austin Quigley became dean, and David Cohen became vice president. In his two roles, Marcus made both the financial and academic decisions for the College. Now that the two positions are unlinked, the dean of the College does not have the same degree of budgetaryauthority or autonomy. The separation of these two roles has created the crack into which the Colloquia seem to have fallen. Since 1995, as the undergraduate community has expanded through Enlargement and Enhancement, and the Administration has restructured itself, the problems that the Colloquia are faced with have turned financial. The fear that many faculty and alumni have is that the financial reasons being used as the justification for eliminating Colloquia could be easily transferred over in the future to the Core. The fear that many students have is that economic decisions are taking precedence over educational ones. James Shapiro, professor of English and Comparative Literature and chair of the Colloquium Committee, said, ""I'm also concerned that the economic argument against funding the Colloquia could be used down the road against Core courses—which, by the same logic, are also not cost-effective. At some point educational priorities need to be recognized."" David Denby, CC '65, whose 1996 book Great Books helped bring critical acclaim to Columbia's Core Curriculum, also expressed wariness toward the administrators' use of cost-effectiveness as the criterion for academic decisions. ""In general, I'm against hurting anything that makes Columbia special on the basis of cost-efficiency,"" Denby told the Spectator. Justin Shubow said that his four years in the College have shown him that ""all this University seems to care about is money."" The Decision Makers After trying unsuccessfully to find someone in Low Library to say ""you came to the right place"" rather than ""you're talking to the wrong person,"" it became clear just how and why this program may no longer be offered. When pressed, Cohen, Provost Jonathan Cole, and Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis all admitted to having seen the issue cross their desks, but no one accepted full responsibility for a decision about the Colloquia or even affirmed that any decision had been made at all. ""We're still struggling to find out where authority comes from,"" said Professor Shapiro. Provost Cole explained that administrative authority over the Colloquia comes from three places: Vice President David Cohen makes budgetary decisions; Dean Quigley makes budgetary and academic decisions; and the Committee on Instruction (COI) makes academic decisions. Though Cole said that he reviews all budgets, he ""would not be reviewing on an annual basis proposals for courses or requests to offer courses."" He then added, ""in fact, I would have nothing to do with the Colloquia."" Though Provost Cole's role as chief academic officer entitles him to review and question all the budgets and academic plans from the individual schools, in response to a request for information about where the decision is made, he said ""I wish I couldhelp you, but,those issues just don't come across my desk."" Provost Cole handed the power of the proverbial red pen over to Vice President Cohen and Dean Quigley. ""[The issue] is clearly in the realm of the College and the Arts and Sciences."" Yet, in response to a request for an interview, Vice President Cohen, through his administrative assistant, said that he was ""the wrong person to talk to."" Only in person, confronted with the directional information that Provost Cole had provided, did Cohen admit that his budgetary decisions affected the Colloquia. The effect of those budgetary decisions clearly makes him the right person to talk to. Cohen said that no definitive decision has been made but that ""there has been a discussion."" He explained that there are two budgets, that of the Arts and Sciences and that of the College, and ""if the College wants to keep the Colloquia, it can support it out of its own budget."" He then said that if he thought the program was worth keeping, ""in principle, the money could come from Arts and Sciences."" Cohen, who during his six-year term as provost of Northwestern University nearly tripled their research budget from $59 million to $lOO million, said ""ultimately, every decision is financial."" The fundamental financial issue at hand with Colloquia is that, whereas previously, faculty who taught the Colloquia did so without reducing their teaching loads for other courses, ""now they're getting released from their other courses."" While Cohen pointed the finger at the professors for teaching fewer classes, the four professors who proposed to teach the Colloquia in the Fall of 1999 were turned away for lack of funds. Cohen, who Professor of Biology Darcy Kelley noted for his ""canny appreciation of the means to academic ends,"" pointed out that ""it's less expensive to knock Colloquia than to hire new faculty. It's a question of how does one deploy resources."" Associate Dean Kathryn Yatrakis, who is also the secretary of the Committee on Instruction (COI), said that ""the COI is continuing its discussion of the Colloquium with the Colloquium Committee."" She pointed out that the COI has been trying to negotiate between students' various interests. ""Students have been expressing two related concerns—the size of class enrollments and the number of senior professors teaching in the Core. This means that the COI and the academic departments have to make judgements about which priorities it will meet first."" Yet, without adequate funding from either Quigley or Cohen's offices, the COI doesn't have much of a decision to make. Dean Quigley did not respond to requests for interviews, nor did he comment on correspondence that was forwarded to him. Provost Cole, Vice President Cohen, and Dean Quigley ensured that Enlargement and Enhancement would not affect the quality of the College's curriculum. ""We will not permit a larger total enrollment to require changes in the College's unique curriculum, the way it is taught, or class size inthe Core,"" they pledged in a February 1996 article in the Columbia University Record. Provost Cole also affirmed that the University classifies the Colloquia as ""upper-level elective Core classes."" However, when asked how the University could cut the Colloquia after he had made the commitment above, he changed his classification, saying, ""The Colloquium is an elective, so therefore it's not really part of the required Core."" The Demise of the Colloquia During their 67-year tenure at Columbia College, the Colloquia have gone through a number of transitional phases. Professor Marcus has observed the Colloquia over the past five decades and commented that in its early years, it was ""not just a course, it was at a very high level with some of the very best faculty teaching it."" He pointed out that ""for a couple of decades in the '6os and 70s, the Colloquia was not staffed in the best way. There was a certain decline because the faculty who were either volunteering or chosen were not as enthusiastic or as committed as faculty in the past have been. This is a historical part of the problem."" Shapiro explained that some of the problems in getting professors to staff the Colloquia stem from the trend at Columbia where more and more professors teach two classes per semester rather than three. While Professors Marcus and Shapiro remember a time when four Colloquia were offered a semester, servingI w approximately 30 seniors and 30 juniors, the current Colloquia's limited resources have made it so that only one class is offered per semester, serving 15 students in total. Today's Columbia College students, who find themselves in larger classes, may lose out on a muchneeded opportunity to have that last connection with what the College's glossy pamphlets market as that which makes Columbia unique. Where Do We Go From Here? After spending three years sending out letters and trying to drum up support for their program within the Administration, the Colloquium Committee is ready to see some action. ""From my perspective, the institution has to make some kind of decision. Either see the Colloquium as important and commit to it or see other programs as more important, in which case defend that, justify that,"" Professor Shapiro said. ""I can live with any decision that's made as long as there's a decision."" If the Administration chose to support the Colloquia, Professor Shapiro suggested that it could be improved by bringing in high-level visiting professors or by making wide-ranging long appointments in faculty. Steven Marcus also noted, ""if it's going to continue, which I hope it will, there would have"
333,1923 College Discovers an Ideology and Changes,13 December 1999,"""We are here to gain a firmer message upon the realities of life, to get knowledge and to transmit it into wisdom, to find new understanding and to be guided to new interpretations, both of nature and of life and of organized man.""Although Nicholas Murray Butler's 1919 commencement speech was not directly addressing the College's brand new Contemporary Civilization course, his lofty sense of purpose for the University reflected Columbia's search for explanations of the unparalleled destruction caused by World War I. The faculty members who created the first class in Columbia's Core Curriculum in January of 1919 believed that an understanding of the present was predicated on the understanding of the philosophy and events of the past. Twenty years previously, a controversy raged in Columbia as the school began to drift toward what today's students would call a pre-profes-sional education, moving away from its traditional focus on liberal arts. The cause for an education that rooted itself in classical Western thought was championed by Professor John Howard Van Amringe, a reject of Columbia's 1890s Greek and Latin department and a mathematics professor who had a reputation for ""favoring athletes over serious students,"" according to An Oasis of Order, Timothy Cross's book on the Core Curriculum. Van Amringe wanted a liberal curriculum ""to teach [students] to look before and after, and in general to use their minds in ways which are appropriate to civil existence."" But Van Amringe, teaching at Columbia at the turn of the century, would fail at his attempt to shape the University into a haven of liberal arts that produced ""gentlemen.""It took until the First World War and a ""war issues"" course, offered at the request of the United States Army for their Student Army Training Corps, to stop the institution's slide toward pre-professional training. But by the time ""war issues"" became Contemporary Civilization in 1919, Van Amringe's lofty statement had been replaced by the desire to educate students who have knowledge of and question contemporary politics. ""The idea rests upon the belief that each new generation as it grows into maturity needs to be aware of the problems of its own group,"" said John J. Coss, first director of the CC program. ""And [they] should be brought to some appreciation of its responsibility within that group."" It is ""an attempt so to inform the students that their social usefulness will be increased in proportion as they follow the methods of intelligent investigation and discrimination,"" said then-Columbia College Dean Herbert Hawkes. Today, as Columbia celebrates the Core's 80th birthday, Van Amringe's statement is an ideal philosophy that attempts to give purpose to Columbia's College insistence that its students take CC, along with Literature, Music and Art Humanities. Coupled with the additions of Logic and Rhetoric and distribution requirements in Major Cultures, science, foreign languages, and physical education, the Core provides the undergraduate College with a universal identity. ""Having this very solid undergraduate education prepares you for life,"" saidDirector of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly. Because every undergraduate in the college must take the full Core Curriculum, it provides a common academic experience for all students to share with one another. Cross said that these required classes give students a common vocabulary ofthe means for intellectual 4f discourse. The ""war issues"" class was in part created to explore the issues surrounding the current conflict in Europe. The end of the war marked the shift in ideology from war issues to issues that concerned American citizens in times of peace, and was temporarily renamed ""peace issues"" and then ""Contemporary Civilization."" The move to institute a mandatory general education course was met with opposition by some faculty members. Many professors felt that the proper mission of a University was to prepare students for future professional work and that a liberal arts education was becoming superfluous in an increasingly modern world. In turned out that CC proved so popular that a second year was added in 1928. The freshman course, CCA, focused on historical issues that shaped the present, while the second year, entitled CC-B, focused on current political and economic problems. However, CC-B proved less popular among students than CC-A. After persisting for a number of years, a 1959 committee recommended that the course no longer be required. The University followed this suggestion in 1961. At the same time that CC was flourishing, Columbia added a General Honors course in 1920 at the behest of Professor of English John Erskine, 'OO. The precursor toOLiterature Humanities, the course was a two-year sequence offered to elite students who passed examina-tions and received personal recommendations from professors. The course consisted of small discussion groups reading well-known works of literature in translation, as Literature Humanities does now, but was discontinued when a second year of CC was added to the curriculum. Given the success of CC in the early '3os, Professor Mark Van Doren led a movement to add a sequence of literature courses to the general education program. The first course entitled Humanities A and later renamed Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), began in 1937 and was required for first-years. The syllabus incuded literature that dated back to medieval times. The second required course, Humanities B, was devoted to fine arts and music and was to be taken in the sophomore year. In 1941, Humanities B was split into two separate semester-long classes that covered art and music individually. Music and Art Humanities became a required component of the Core Curriculum in 1947. There have been several failed attempts to add a science course similar in scope to the humanities to the Core. As early as 1934, Hawkes oversaw the development of an optional two-year science sequence. Loosely modeled after CC, the courses provided a general education in the natural sciences. In 1941, however, with faculty focusing their efforts on World War 11, Science A and B were dropped. Since then, other attempts to addft* general, inclusive science classes to the core have been unsuccessful. According to Cross, among others, science often involves lab work, and thus it would be difficult to offer nonspecific overview courses. The Core thrived in the years following World War 11, solidifying its place in the College and in Western education. Administrators and professors from other universities regularly took trips to Columbia to observe its famed Core. Humanities A and CC sections were taught by some of the College's most distinguished faculty members, including Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, '25. Adding to the Core's influence within the University was the 1959 decision to require engineering students to take some Core classes. However, the Core did have its opponents. Increasingly, students and faculty denounced Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization as the study of dead white males. In the aftermath of the 1968 protests, students deemed the Core to be conservative, Eurocentric, and irrelevant. In 1970, a committee headed by Professor Robert Belknap proposed replacing Core classes with distribution requirements. In response to the committee's suggestion to end CC, the editors of the alumni publication Columbia College Today wrote: ""Even if the course is still basically sound, its eventual disappearance would not necessarily be a tragedy."" In retrospect, Professor William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, described the committee's recommendations as ""insignificant"" and said that the Administration never seriously considered implementing the plan. In 1988, a committee headed by de Bary asserted that CC and Lit Hum should maintain a Western focus and recommended that the Core be extended to include new courses that would examine Asian and African civi-"
