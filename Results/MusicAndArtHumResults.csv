0,Art Humanities,Livelier Arts,12 February 1964,"The Humanities B courses—art and music —may seem very different in content from Humanities A. Yet in the view of the Stern Committee, similar principles underlie similar recommendations. The principles are that more intellectual precision and discipline are needed, and that ""models of discourse"" are desirable. The principal suggestion is for more and better readings. We think both the principles and recommendations are sound, even more clearly so than in Humanities A. Art and music, after all, are ""foreign languages"" to many students. Without a rigorous approach, involving the development of a scholarly and critical attitude, they tend to remain so. ""The student,"" as the Stern Committee says, ""must be given sufficient guidance so that he can move towards a disciplined vision of a work of art."" In the case of both the art and music courses, the committee has concluded, and the staffs have agreed, that superior readings would enhance the understanding of the works studied and also of the principles embodied in them. In each case, it was also found that no existing book could properly perform these functions. For art humanities, the staff will develop a volume with essays that illuminate historical and cultural contexts, and also serve as models of analysis. In music, an analagous collection of readings will be created. As in Humanities A, there is always the possibility that the student will copy his model of discourse rather than learn from it. In Humanities B, however, the risks are small compared with the potential gain. Too many students have no idea at all of how to respond to or understand a work of art. Better readings can help the instructor give them that knowledge. One other recommendation, with regard to art humanities, strikes us as particularly good. It asks that guided visits to museums be an integral part of the course. With New York's abundant artistic resources, it has always seemed strange that discussion between teacher and student should take place only in front of slides of varying quality. The music humanities staff might also consider further ways of exploring New York's artistic resources. The rich program of concerts in the city, in particular, might be used more extensively. The acceptance of the proposals on Humanities B by the respective staffs is promising. The Stern Committee's recommendations will help improve two courses that are worthwhile in their purposes, but could be better in some of their practices. (This editorial is the last of three on the report of the Dean's Committee on the Humanities Courses in Columbia College.)"
1,Art Humanities,Humanities B Staffs Study New Readings Committee Calls Present Materials Inadequate,20 April 1964,"Committee Calls Present Materials InadequateBy Michael T. GenglerThe staffs of Music and Fine Arts Humanities are currently collecting materials for new second-year humanities textbooks, in line with the recent recommendations of the special committee on the humanities courses chaired by Professor of History Fritz Stern. The present reading assignments were found inadequate by the Stern Committee, which suggested that each staff ""collect and commission"" a collection of readings for its course. The recommendations of the Stern Committee on Humanities B were referred ""with favor"" to the staffs in December by the Committee on Instruction. Professor of Art History Everard M. Upjohn, chairman of Art Humanities, said last week that a committee had been appointed ""to collect what material may be appropriate"" for a course textbook. The committee is headed by Saul Levine, an instructor in art history. Professor Upjohn termed the committee's task ""a very longrange undertaking."" He added that the staff has no immediate intention of changing the readings now offered until the committee has finished its work. The chairman of Music Humanities, Associate Professor of Music Jack Beeson, said that the staff had begun talking about a new selection of readings for its course last year, before the Stern Committee had presented its recommendations. He hoped that the new readings would be ready in .mimeographed form for use next year. The readings will consist of composers' letters and essays, as well as critical reviews from various historical periods. Professor Beeson said that the Music Humanities course was being reorganized to give instructors the opportunity to be ""more specific"" in their, discussions of the music. Listening periods will be used for the uninterrupted playing of music. Instructors will discuss overall features of style or organization of specific pieces as theychoose in class. Professor Beeson hoped that there would be ""a minimal concern with background materials"" in regular class hours. The readings will give students a historical background — ""what people have thought about music"" —Professor Beeson said. The Stern Committee made several other recommendations concerning the Art Humanities course. It questioned whether the chronological approach now used was the best/way to conduct the course. Professor Upjohn said that new iristructors are now encouraged to follow the order of the syllabus, which is chronologically arranged,but that as instructors gain experience, they are free to vary this approach. Another recommendation of the committee suggested that supple-mentary classes be scheduled in late afternoons and used for guided museum visits; Professor Up John said that Art Humanities instructors are already expected to conduct at least one such visit each term, and preferably two."
2,Art Humanities,Ivan M. Weissman Goodbye—024633,1 June 1964,"Goodbye— 024633024633 ends its career today. The Graduate School of Journalism will offer a different Columbia identification number in the fall. The number which has been mine throughout my undergraduate years ought to be retired. 024633 has experienced so much that asking for four more years at Columbia College would be gluttonous. The day I merged with 024633 was unforgettable. Upperclassmen told freshmen the annual legends of men starving while waiting on registration lines. Disliking hunger, I arose early to beat the hordes on freshman registration day. The effort was futile because it still took three hours to ""be processed."" I emerged from the line awed at the complexity of the Columbia bureaucracy. More importantly, though, I knew that I really belonged. I had been given my own identification number. Adjusting from high school senior to 024633 was difficult. The amount of work required was absurd and New Hall was a prison. Nothing was left to believe in. My C.C. instructor could find fallacies in the arguments of men who seemed totally convincing when read in my room the night before. Professor Shenton destroyed my belief in the perfection of demigods of American history. My English instructor found so much to criticize that my papers were returned with comments longer than my composition. Being 024633 made me a man. I learned to stay up all night. I learned to stomach Ta-Kome food. I adjusted to having gym at 9 a.m. I resisted the lures of the pitchmen from fraternities. 024633 and I grew compatible. C.C. and Humanities came as revelations after a staple diet of Amsco ■Review Books and pat high school explanations. After bold experimentation with crew and lightweight football, my survival instincts prompted membership in Spectator and WKCR. 024633 soon became a worldly sophisticate among identification cards. As a broadcaster for WKCR and reporter for Spectator, I became a frequent visitor to exotic ports of call such as Providence, New Haven, and Ithaca. These road trips with Columbia teams destroyed the illusions of glamorous life at other Ivy League campuses. The parties of Cornell seemed monotonous, the values of beautiful campuses seemed transitory, and being anyplace but in New York seemed unthinkable. Suddenly I was proud to be 024633 of Columbia. 024633 and I were being molded into ""whole men."" How could we be otherwise after music and art humanities? Culturation occurred despite great obstacles. Forgiving the Metropolitan Opera for darkening the hall and making note-taking imposs-ible was difficult when a concert report was due the following morning. The list of paintings to be viewed at museums before the art exam caused a frenzied trip downtown. My colleagues vowed to look only at required paintings to avoid becoming confused. Surprisingly, most of us advanced to higher levels of dilettantism in advanced music and art courses. 024633 and I endured many academic battles. Completing the math-science requirement was an epic feat. We even earned the nickname of the ""green giant"" for performance in botany. We brought cheer into the humdrum existence of a guard while completing a fifty page paper for Professor Metzger. We camped all night in my father's downtown office to take advantage of the electric typewriter, air conditioner, and stocked refrigerator. The building watchman was delighted by our company and wanted to know if we would return to chat every evening. 024633 and I think we took the best College courses. The race to keep pace with fast-talking Professor Rothschild was lost in a course on western Europe but the course was brilliant despite an incomplete notebook. We felt compelled to record every word of the eloquent Professor Metzger in his United States in the Twentieth Century course. Humanities 3-4 was dessert after Humanities A. Our senior seminar on political leadership climaxed a stimulating experience. 024633 and I were enticed by extracurricular activities. Spectator became our child. Its demands for attention were relentless. When mistakes were made, cab trips to the plant were taken at 2 a.m. After Saturday night dates, all-night vigils to prepare Monday's paper were often necessary. We complained about the newspaper's insane demands. Somehow we always thought that it was worthwhile. 024633 and I saw a crucial change in Columbia sports during our four years. Losing was normalcy during our freshman year. A football championship in our sophomore year and the arrival of two exciting young coaches —Jack Rohan for basketball and Carl Ullrich for crew—made Columbia a winner. 024633, a child of IBM, noticed only an improvement in winning percentages. A more sentient observer could detect the greater assimilation of the athlete into the Columbia community. Winning improved campus morale. Archie Roberts became a household word. Coaches imposed stricter standards of behavior on athletes. Athletes complied because they respected their coaches.024633 and I share memories of vicarious participation in Columbia athletics. The experience of describing President Kennedy at the Harvard-Columbia football game in the WKCR broadcast and Spectator story won't be forgotten. The stories of football victory over Cornell and the basketball upset of Princeton will provide lively fodder for alumni gatherings. Some memories are more personal. The moments of interviewing Archie Roberts after Columbia lost Homecoming Game to Princeton seemed interminable when neither of us knew what to say. The pain of Mohawk Airlines nights to Ithaca will remain in my stomach. The hardiest of Columbia athletes cringed with fear at these airborne adventures. 024633, time has run out. The range of our experiences together has been vast—from discovery of the half-truths of horror stories about Barnard to inspiration by professors whose incisiveness was awesome. A wag with access to an IBM machine prepared punch cards as mock diplomas. His aim was to parody 024633. The jest is weak. Four yf ars at Columbia have been more stimulating and weighted with personal meaning than an identification to the Columbia registrar will ever indicate — 024633 of the Class of 1964."
3,Art Humanities,The Art of Teaching Art,28 September 1964,"Anyone who has ever to Prof. Everard M. Upjohn feels a bit prouder for being at Columbia. Anyone who has ever been in one of his classes and seen him in action has come to admire his sytle. For the man has the attributes of a great and memorable teacher. Witty and frank, Art History's departmental representative is a master of the teaching art. Despite the image of severity he has acquired, most of his students leave his class eager to have him again. Even those who have never met him will find an ally in Professor Upjohn as critic of new eampus architecture. Ferris Booth and New Halls, says he, ""are a major architectural disaster, extraneous and unrelated to a campus which before was an integrated whole. They look as if they are thumbing their nose at everything about them, and their visual relationship to the surroundings is deplorable."" Professor Upjohn, who was originally brought to Columbia in the fall of 1935 to develop the undergraduate division of the University's Fine Arts department, likes to think that his department is run like ""a taut ship."" He is sometimes reassured of this when one of his colleagues salutes before speaking to him. Remembering the past with fond memories, Professor Upjohn is still very much a man of the future. When he suggested, shortly after World War H, that Art Humanities be made a required course, he wastold by a veteran faculty member that he ""had just voted himself out of a job."" Today, administering the course to some 750 stuients, he finds, in light of the Stern Committee's report, that his department has already had most of the committee's prposals in effect for some time. His staff, for example, prepares the final examination collectively, and includes material not covered in class on the examination. Instructors already cover one or two topics more comprehensively than other topics. (These were among the Stern Committee's recommen-dation.) Most instructors conduct museum trips which are still optional merely because the staff does not deem the existance of 'museum trip sections' feasible. Only background readings continue to play a secondary role, and Professor Upjohn explains that ""we've been working halfheartedly at this problem partly because I am not at all convinced that more extensive reading would strengthen the course."" As are all departments, Art History is plagued by the perennial problem of men who can be found in the Graduate Faculties but who are reluctant to teach undergraduate courses. Professor Upjohn is all for experienced teachers but strongly suggests that ""while young men are less profound in experience, they have enthusiasm and freshness of approach which we many not get in our older professors who sometimes never reach their class with their depth. If a person is really going to be good, he has to feel that this (Art Humanities) is God's gift to the College; that it is more important than a seminar."" Professor Upjohn is a happy man who thinks of his work as ""a source of enjoyment, a real intellectual satisfaction."" He regards his department ""as healthier than ever,"" and firmly rejects the suggestion that the liberal arts college is slowly folding into its grave. To him the College student is ""extraordinarily alive, intellectualy curious and mentally lazy eager to short-circuit, to jump to discussion without the facts to back it up."" Comfortably snug in his upholstered chair, a rascal smile on his face, Professor Upjohn talks with obvious delight about his moments of relaxation. Every day without fail he hastely eats his lunch at the Men's Faculty Club and then ""puts in"" some thirty minutes of bridge. He carefully explains that he can work more efficiently in the afternoon. Back in the '30s Professor Upjohn belonged to the Dean's Protective Association, a clan whose membership included several deans and apresident of Teachers College, all avid bridge players. It is comforting to speak to a man of his rank who confesses that he does not ""pretend"" to understand modern art. ""I still prefer something I can recognize; I can't stomach modern art, it leaves me cold,"" he adds emphatically. Concerned about Columbia's future, Professor Upjohn hopes thatthe planned expansion for the College will not begin before ho retires. To a man who crmsidars Columbia unique iri its approach to general education, the thongut of inevitable growth is somewhat disturbing. For he suspects that expansion ""will occur before we are ready for it with expanded staff and facilities, and will force us away from discussion classes to big lectures, thus throwing us thirty to forty years back."" Professor Upjohn is a rare specimen in a University in which a large segment of the faculty prefers research to teaching. He looks eagerly forward to the future even though it will eventually lead to his retirement. And he only hopes that when the time has come to retire, there will still be a few bridge players around. - DANIEL EPSTEINEverard M. Upjohn"
4,Art Humanities,Art Humanities to Drop Department-Wide Finals,14 December 1966,"Final examinantions drawn up by individual professors will replace departmental teste in Art Humanities this semester for the first time, according to Professor of Art History George R. Collins. These will be the firsit non-de-partmental finals to be given in any Humanities course, Professor Collins said yesterday. Music Humanities and freshman Humanities will continue to administer departmental itests. Professor Coillins noted that the individual exams are on an experimental basis, and faculty and student reaction will determine whether they are continued."
5,Art Humanities,Branner to Head Art History Dept.,16 February 1968,"Professor Robert Branner will become chairman of the Department of Art History and Archeology on July 1. He replaces Professor Rudolph Wittkower, who has been head of the department for 12 years. Professor Branner received his BA in 1948 and his PhD in 1953. Before comingto Columbia in 1957, he was an assistant professor at the University of Kansas. A specialist in medieval art and architecture, Professor Branner presently teaches a section of the Art Humanities course and a graduate proseminar in medieval art. Professor Wittkower plans to retire in July, 1969, and .will take a sabbatical leave during the academic year 1968-69.Robert Branner"
6,Art Humanities,Art History Struggles for Space,5 March 1969,"By JIM SHAWThe entire staff of the art history department may resign from the University, suspend classes, or demonstrate ""in or around"" Low Library unless the administration provides the department with increased space and facilities before next fall, Robert Branner, professor of art history and chairman of the department, stated yesterday. In an hour-long interview yesterday aftenoon, Professor Branner decried the ""hopelessly inadequate"" facilities available to his department and said that the departmental staff —which met yesterday to consider the problem will definitely take some action to protest the matter. ""No one is willing to take the decision to help my department,"" Professor Branner declared. ""The administration keeps sweeping it under the carpet."" The art history department, which includes 57 faculty members and about 180 graduate students, is housed in nine offices on the sixth and eighth floorsof Schermerhorn Hall. None of the department's professors., including Professor Branner, have private offices and most of the art history faculty is crowded into multiple, unpartitioned suites. In two offices on the eighth floor of Schermerhorn, five faculty members, including several full professors, share the available space. In another room, eight faculty members crowd the office. Professor Branner stated that his department would need 42 rooms to provide each professor with a private office and allow instructors ""double occupancy."" The department chairman noted that more than 1200 undergraduates —including several . hundred who enroll in required Art Humanities sections —take courses in art history each semester and he said the depart'ment's facilities, particularly the art library, are insufficient. The Fine Arts Library, which is also located on the eighth floor of Schermerhorn, will runout of stack space by the end of this year, Professor Branner said. There are only 38 study spaces available in the stacks, he said, and only graduate students are granted access to the rear library shelves. The office of the librarian is situated in a narrow area in the stacks and his ""annex,"" including a desk for ordering library cards, is located in the middle of the reading room. Last month, the librarian of the Fine Arts Library, Robert C. Kaufman, resigned his post effective August 31, scoring the administration for neglecting theart history facilities. '""Terms such as 'inadequate space' fail utterly to describe the hell-hole which the Fine Arts Library has become to its staff and users,"" Mr. Kaufman wrote in his letter Of resignation. ""No other members of the University community work in such miserable quarters and with such poor, inadequate, outmoded, decrepit, ugly, and badly arranged, meanly-housed equipment as does my staff,"" he charged. Until recently, the department's collection of 100,000 photographs, valued by Professor Branner at $250,000 were housed in a sixth floor hallway where they were a fire hazard. The photographs have been moved to 420 Schermerhorn, but, according to Professor Branner, the room is not large enough to allow students to carefully seek out and examine the photographs. Professor Branner said the administration offered his department the use of Myles Cooper Hall on 110 th Street about four years ago. But, shortly after the department accepted the offer, the building became unavailable.When the department recently petitioned the Trustees for space, the chairman said, a Trustee committee inspected the department's facilities and' voted to offer the art history staff McVicker Hall, which currently houses the School of International Affairs. That hall, however, proved to be too small for the department, he said. The University has considered plans for constructing a joint Arts Center on Amsterdam and 115 th Street to house the Music, Fine Arts and Architecture departments but the art history chairman is not optimistic about this plan. ""We've had assurances all along,"" he said. ""That we would do nothing at this point is not a possibility."" * !CLOSE QUARTERS: The art history department is hoping to expand its facilities. Librarian's office is shown here."
7,Art Humanities,Music Humanities Faculty Approves Pass-Fail Grading,14 March 1969,"By JURIS KAZAThe Music Humanities teaching staff has approved a proposal by the College Committee on Instruction to adopt pass-fail grading in its Humanities B courses next semester, Joel Newman, associate professor of music, said yesterday. According to Vice Dean Thomas S. Colahan, now that the humanities instructors have adopted the suggestion of the Committee on Instruction, the matter will be referred back to the committee for final approval. ""The committee is taking the initiative,"" Dean Colahan said yesterday, ""to put to the test the 'mystical quality' ascribed to pass-fail grading."" Robert Branner, chairman of the department of art history and archaeology, said yesterday that he felt ""pass-fail can be tried in Art Humanities courses next year on an experimental basis."" Professor Newman also said that students in all fourteen Music Humanities sections are being polled on the adoption of pass-fail grading for the current semester. He added that a ""plurality of Music Humanities instructors agreed 'to present the student poll to the Committee on Instruction."" According to Dean Colahan, the Committee's proposal called for giving pass-fail grades ""in the usual manner, with the registrar converting letter grades into a P or F on the student's record."" Dean Colahan termed the Committee's proposal ""a meaningful experiment with a large population"" . He said that individual classes requesting pass-fail grading ""wouldn't prove a damn thing"" be-; cause of the small number of students involved. Recently the teaching staff of English A rejected aproposalfrom . the Committee on Instruction to place half of all freshman composition classes on pass-fail grading this semester."
8,Art Humanities,Hovde to Release Pass-Fail Plan For Basic Freshman Courses,14 April 1969,"By MARTIN FLUMENBAUMThe College Committee on Instruction has recommended that students enrolled in almost all of the required degree courses next year receive a grade of either pass or fail. The proposal, if approved by the College faculty later this month, would place virtually the entire freshman year on a mandatory pass-fail basis. In a statement prepared for release today, Dean Carl F. Hovde said that the plan combines ""thepossible virtues of the pass-fail system"" with the committee's conviction ""that students must be carefully evaluated by their teachers."" The' one-year pass-fail plan would include the three basic freshman year courses —Humanities A, English composition and Contemporary Civilization A—as well as all introductory language courses, art humanities, and music humanities. In addition, the committee re-commended that five year-long ""poet's"" sciences coursesastronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics—be included in the grading experiment. Any two of these five courses can fulfill the current math-science requirement. The entire experimental plan is subject to review after one year. The eleven-man committee also suggested three alternatives for evaluating student performance in the mandatory pass-fail course. First, instructors could indicate the performance of any student working below C level at midterms. A second option would be to submit letter grades at the end of each semester to the Dean's Office, with the understanding that they would not appear on the student's permanent record. Third, for those faculty members who think that even unrecorded grading impedes proper learning, the committee proposed that instructors complete questionnaires at the end of the semester evaluating their students. The questionnaire could rate each student on his class attendance; the amount of readingcompieted before class discussions; overall command and control of the materials and techniques of the course; written performance in class; and participation in class discussion. A typical set of evaluations used on the committee's sample questionnaire listed the following gradations in performance: ""suberb, fine, solid, adequate, and inadequate."" The instructor is also asked to evaluate term papers and judge the student's ability to ""make testable formulations"" and ""marshal an argument."" The instructor can also recommend a student for academic awards, tutoring, or even psychiatric help. Dean Hovde stated that there are two major reasons why the committee's proposal focuses on the freshman year. ""Students entering selective colleges have for many years been under pressure to collect as many good grades as possible,"" the Dean said. ""It may prove to be true that a first year without publicly recorded fi-experiment primarily because letter grades in the courses were thought necessary for medical and graduate school applications.^, The Committee on Instruction is the College's academic de-cision-making body, and must approve all curricular and grading reforms. A faculty smoker will .be held April 21-to discuss the proposal. Later this month the College faculty will meet to make a final decision. Under the College's current pass-fail option, instituted in September 1967, a student may register for pass-fail credit for only one non-required course per semester. If the proposal is approved by the faculty, however, freshmen or sophomores who take mandatory pass-fail courses will not be permitted to use the regular passfail option. At the request of the Human •Development staff, the Committee "" on Instruction also recommended that all courses in that department be graded on a pass-fail b,asis.nal grades will make students more comfortable without reducing the will to work."" He also remarked that ""passfail entries for the first year will not prejudice our students in their applications to graduate school."" The proposal omits introductory science courses required for majors in chemistry, psychology, mathematics and physics. These were excluded from the pass-fail•/-'. The following is the text of Dean Hovde 's announcement: The College Committee on Instruction is putting forth for consideration by faculty and students a proposal which, if approved for trial, would put the freshman year substantially on a pass-fail basis. We have spent many hours talking about the various suggestions which have been made about the grading system, and while doing so we have on principle denied individual requests for exceptions to ten present letter-grade system. To have done otherwise would have been to change by special precedent a system established by the faculty long ago, and in a matter where there are strong arguments for common practice and control. In making this proposal we have tried to balance twothings--on the one hand, the possible virtues of the pass-fail system and, on the other, our firm conviction that students must be carefully evaluated by their teachers-no change in grading can be permitted to diminish this. The proposal focuses on the freshman year for, several reasons. Students entering selective colleges have for many years been under pressure to collect as many good grades as possible, and it may prove to be true that a first year without publicly recorded final grades will make students more comfortable without reducing the will to work. It is to be noted that our plan assures just as much information as we now have about performance for Columbia's own purposes-the only change is that the final grades would not be recorded on the transcript. That we suggest this for freshman courses does not indicate any feeling that these courses are ""less important"" than more advanced work; but we feel, among other things, that pass-fail entries for the first year will not prejudice our students in their applications to graduate schools, which are primarily concerned with upper-college performance, particularly in the major. It was for a similar reason that we omitted the introductory science courses which are important public evidence for students who. are applying to some graduate programs, medical school being an example. We propose this plan for trial in the coming academic year.II 111 Ml ■■ I 111 I I 1 EEM^^^m^— A Note to Some Skeptical Readers Who Thought Friday's Spectator Was an April Fool's Issue Once a year reporters on Spectator prove to themselves that the events in the so-called real world which they cover are not so different from complete fiction. That annual occasion came last Friday when our April Fool's issue appeared. We regret that the difference between reality and fantasy is so narrow. One Rockland paper almost printed that the county would soon be the site of an ABM installation. But, as one professor explained, when people have an orientation toward calamity, they become especially gullible. Of course, we have only one April Fool's issue a year. The rest of the time we pretend that our readers are relentless skeptics.

9,Art Humanities,Faculty May Reject Pass-Fail Plan,12 May 1969,"By MARTIN FLUMENBAUMThe College faculty will probably reject the passfail proposal for basic liberal arts courses approved last month by the Committee on Instruction, Dean Carl F. Ilovde predicted last week. ""My suspicion is that it will be voted down,"" he stated. According to the Dean, ""the majority feeling"" at an informal faculty smoker last Tuesday was against the pass-fail proposal. The faculty is scheduled to vote on the plan May 19. II the plan is endorsed, students next year will receive grades of either ""pass"" or ""fail"" in Humanizes A, first-year Contemporary Civilizations, English composition, introductory language courses, art humanities, music humanities, and five ""poet's"" science courses. The entire experiment would be subject to review after one year. Dean Ilovde also stated that the proposal suggested by Professor of English Quentin Anderson for a single ten-point course for freshmen met only scattered opposition at the smoker and has a ""good chance"" of being approved at the official faculty meeting next week. The ten-point course, which was recently approved by the Committee on Instruction, would replace CCA, Humanities and English composition for 150 freshmen next year. The pass-fail proposal would place virtually the entire freshman year on a mandatory pass-fail basis. Dean Ilovde said that ""almost every conceivable objection was raised"" to the grading change.Vice Dean Thomas S. Colahan remarked that at the smoker the Committee on Instruction ""came out looking like a bunch of radicals."" ""There was considerable opposition to the Anderson proposal from the younger faculty,"" Dean Colahan stated. ""On the question of pass-fail, everyone was pushing their own plans."" The Anderson proposal has been strongly criticized by the College Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee, which contends that the Anderson plan lacks ""breadth"" and would be ""demoralizing"" to freshmen who-lose interest in the selected topic. The student group has suggested an alternative plan which would eliminate English compostion and substitute in its place a course modeled on English 1003, involving intensive examination of a single work or author. In addition, the committee's proposal would enable freshmen to take any one of the three major required courses as a seminar."
10,Art Humanities,Faculty Turns Down Pass-Fail Proposal,3 June 1969,"The College faculty voted by a narrow margin on May 21 to reject the pass-fail proposal for the basic liberal arts courses approved by the Committee on Instruction in April. Only sixty of the three hundred eligible voting members of the faculty attended the meeting. The proposal would have placed virtually the entire freshman year on'a mandatory pass-fail basis. The one-year plan would have included the three basic first year courses—Humanities A, English composition, and Contemporary Civilization A—as well as all introductory language courses, art humanities, music humanities, and five one-year ""poet's"" science courses. Next year, under a restricted pilot program approved by the faculty, students enrolled in music humanities, art humanities, and human development will receive pass-fail grades. The proposal suggested by Professor of English Quentin Anderson for a single ten-point course for freshmen to replace CCA, Humanities, and English composition was tabled by the faculty after attendance at the meeting decreased to the point where a voting quorum was not available. On the first ballot of the pass-fail vote, the proposal passed by a slim two-vote margin, 2S-2€. When a recount was requested the proposal was then defeated by a 32-28 vote. Dean Carl F. Hovde, one of the major supporters of the pass-fail plan, expressed disappointment Friday over the poor attendance at the meeting. He stated that he plans to set up a faculty committee to review the general education curriculum in the College early next semester. Dean Hovde indicated that a ""reexamination"" of all required courses, the science requirement, and the second year Contemporary Civilization courses was needed."
11,Art Humanities,Schermerhorn Hall: Spaced Out,17 October 1969,"By JURIS KAZAProfessors and preceptors rest their feet on each other's desks. Rocks are packed and shipped to unbuilt buildings. Psychologists feel the walls closing in. This is overcrowding in Schermerhorn Hall. Various solutions have been suggested to Columbia's number one crowding problem. Some are adequate, but long-term, some are short-term, but inadequate. As a result, three departmental chairmen in Schermerhorn have either left the university or resigned their posts in connection with the space-shortage controversy. Last year, the geology department, in anticipation of transferring manj of its facilities to new buildings to be constructed at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, offered one floor to the psychology department and additional space to the badly overcrowded art historydepartment. When it became apparent last July that there would be insufficent funds for the construction at Lamont, Charles Drake, chairman of the department of geology left the university for a post at Dartmouth College. Students in his department had left with very few individual mineral study rooms, because it was necessary to convert them into classrooms. In the art history department, formerly headed by Robert Br anner, professors, associate professors, instructors and graduate students are crammed into offices by the .fives and sixes, while out in the hallway, art humanities students crowd around inadequate exhibit facilities. The art history library staff has also complained about the lack of space. In the face of such adversity, Professor Branner left for a better positionat Johns Hopkins University last spring. Professor Robert Bush, who chaired the department of psychology, is still at Columbia. He resigned after the university went back-on its promise to give his department 10,000 square feet of space each year for the next five years, to be made available as geology moved to Lamont. But construction at Lamont was delayed, and the administration was compelled to renege on its previous commitment. Various solutions have been proposed to alleviate the space crush. Back in Professor Branner's days, there was talk of a strike by art history faculty, to force some aqtion by the administration. Intra-building space shuffles, which have directly contributed to the demise of two chairmen, have so far been ineffective. According to H. Joris Rosse,iirector of space utilization, the university is still pursuing a policy of making the most of existing space. ""We are, however,"" Mr. Rosse said, ""planning some renovations, such as double decking some of the floors to make more room for psychology."" ""Some high administration officials have made promises,"" Mr. Rosse added, ""and at present, I don't think I should give any names."" A long range solution to the space catastrophe in Schermerhorn appears to lie in I. M. Pei's proposed underground building between Avery, Schermerhorn, and Fayerweather. However, Professor of Architecture Alexander Kouzmanoff, architect for the complex, said that he thought the building will only be a ""first step in solving the space problem."" Prpfessor Kouzmanoff's ""preliminary conceptions"" allow for classroom space and exhibit areas v in the multi-story structure, and three levels of the complex will ' contain additional stacks and facilities for the expanding library of the School of Architecture. The complex, thus, may become an underground solution for two separate shortages.""Architecture is planning to expand its enrollment,"" said Professor Kouzmanoff, ""and we're setting our sights on Fayerweather. The people in hberre will be able to relocate when the School of International Affairs is completed and when the South Field towers are built. We want that carpentry shop in the basement."" According to Professor Kouzmanoff, construction of the underground building should begin next summer and be completed by early' 1971."
12,Art Humanities,Art Faculty Gives Pass-Fail a ‘Pass’,18 February 1970,"By ELIZABETH WEINERAfter one-semester, the pass-fail grading experiment in art humanities has received qualified approval from the majority of art history instructors. At an informal meeting yesterday, the instructors laced approval for the flexibility of passfail with suggestions for modifying and refining the new system. A one-year experiment in pass-fail was instituted this fall in art and music humanities under the supervision of the College Committee on Instruction. The committee specified that each instructor must assign the same number of exams and papers as were used previously to determine letter grades. The committee has not yet met with humanities instructors to discuss response to the pass-fail system, although a formal evaluation is planned in the future. According to David Rosand, associate professor of art history, and departmental representative, many instructors feel that pass-fail allows much greater freedom for both teachers and students, while alleviating the pressure on students for high grades. Professor of Art History Howard McP. Davis said he has found his ""students more productive, class discussions freer."" Professor Rosand remarked that students in his section ""gave of themselves freely, while I felt free for the first time to stray from the syllabus."" Others claimed that pass-fail was ""the only equitable grading system for required courses,"" particularly where many students have no background in the discipline. Eugene Santomasso, instructor in art history, said he kept personal records of achievement, and ""found them more useful to students than •grades."" The major criticisms voiced by the instructors concern the rate of attendance and amount of effort expended by students in the course. Average daily attendance in art humanities sec-tions dropped from 450 last year to 250 this semester. Some teachers feared that students assured of a passing grade felt no compulsion to attend classes. Although Professor Rosand detected a ""slackening off of work and attendance,"" he noted that the ""quality of many papers was high."" Another instructor, Ann Farkas, found that assignments were passed in promptly, and that the exams were unusually well-at-tended. Only one or two students failed art humanities last semester, but Professor Rosand said this was due ""as much to the traditional reluc-: tance of teachers to give failinggrades in required courses as to the nature of the pass-fail system."" Only one professor expressed unequivocal disapproval of the pass-fail experiment. Professor Everard Upjohn, who is on leave this semester and did not attend yesterday's meeting said last week ""I do not think that pass-fail grading is at all desirable."" Several recommendations for modifying the pass-fail system were advanced by the art humanities faculty yesterday. Mr. Santomasso suggested that a letter grade option should be available to those students who need grades for graduate school admissions. Other instructors proposed refinement ofthe pass grade to indicate extra effort. Les Lepow, '71, editor of the Columbia-Barnard Course Guide, attended yesterday's meeting to present an overview of student reactions to the pass-fail experiment in art history. Lepow told the faculty group that only two students, out of 200 who returned course evaluation questionnaires for the humanities course, expressed disapproval of the passfail system. ""The vast majority praised pass-fail for removing academic pressures,"" Lepow explained, ""and only ""a few students admitted that they had expended less energy in the course.*Howard McP. Davis"
13,Art Humanities,Panel Asks Distributional Program,29 April 1970,"The College Committee on Educational Policy last night, in a surprise move, voted to recommend to the College faculty that students be required to take at least four semester courses ""in fields remote from their major;"" that either art or music humanities — but not both—be required; that the Contemporary Civilization B requirement be abolished; and that the math-science requirement be reduced to one year of natural science. The four-semester distributional requirement would be the first such program in the College. Under its provisions, for example, science students would have to take four courses of their choice in non-science fields. History majors would have to take four courses outside the social sciences. The group's final decision differed in several respects from the original plan introduced at the meeting by Assistant Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman. TheHoltzman plan had provided for a mandatory year of either language or mathematics, while the version approved by the sixteen-man panel maintained the current language requirement and did not include any requirements which could be fulfilled by mathematics courses,except the tour-semester distributional requirement. The Holtzman plan had allowed literature courses to satisfy the Humanities B. requirement. Under the present plan, only art or music will now do so. Furthermore, the Holtzman plan had provided a two-semester distribution requirement in social science. The committee's proposal states that social science can be used only as an optional way of fulfilling the four semesters outside the major. Robert Belknap, professor of Russian and chairman of the panel, said last night that he expects a final copy of the group's recommendations to appear late this week or early next week. The plan will go before the Col- j lege faculty at its meeting in mid•May and, according to Professor , Belknap, it will be extensively dis-.; cussed beforehand with students i and faculty members. Members of the committee have j indicated that the plan stands a 'good cnance of passage by the faculty. Professor Belknap said last night that the committee had decided at the meeting to require either music or art humanities because of a ""dread of some people's grim determination to restrict themselves to their field."" The chairman indicated that agreement had been reached among nearly all committee members on the proposals ""I can't imagine unanimity among them, but there was apretty heavy consensus,"" he said. The chairman noted that if the proposal were approved,the College requirements beyond the freshman year would be quite similar to those at Barnard. He said this is ""a slight step"" toward cooperation between the two schools. The committee, which will meet four more times this year, is expected to deal with other problems such as the staffing of College courses. ,"
14,Art Humanities,Letter to the Faculty,16 September 1970,"It has become apparent that if Columbia College is to continue offering students the quality education for which it has been noted, curriculum changes are necessary. If we do not move with the times while maintaining our standards, we soon shall be left behind. Having thought about the matter, and having read a number of curriculum reform plans of other institutions, I would like to submit the following proposals. The assumptions underlying the following proposals are: —that there is such a vital object as a liberal srts curriculum and it still has validity and relevance; --that an education is incomplete without systematic exposure to the disciplines which comprise the liberal arts, for they foster the necessary spirit of critical inquiry and appreciation, albeit in disparate ways; --that exposure to aspects of the liberal arts cannot and should notbe left wholly to chance; and, —that given the increasing diversity of the College student body, there is a need for at least a minimum collegial common experience such as is to be found in the original basic general education courses. The proposals are: I. Requirements for the degree should be the following: —Humanities A and Contemporary Civilization A. -Art Humanities and Music Humvanities. •—A seminar in the style of English ClOO3, —Two semester courses in natural science, one of which should be a laboratory course. —Two semester courses in the social sciences drawn from appropriate introductory courses in anthropology, economics, history, political science, or sociology. —Two semester courses informal and analytical thought drawn from introductory courses in Unguis-tics, mathematics, or philosophy. -rßeading competence in a foreign language, to be demonstrated through proficiency examinations taken no later than, the end of the sophomore year; these examinations to serve as an alternative to the introductory language courses. —Two semesters of physical education. 11. Students should continue to have majors, which must be declared before registering for a sixth term. The major program should be subject to the following: —students should be allowed to, work out individually designed in-' terdepartmental majors subject to the approval of the departmental consultants and the Committee on Instruction or an appropriate subcommittee to be appointed by it. —qualified seniors whose programs have been approved by their major department and the Committee on Instruction or an appropriate sub-committee to be appointed by it may be granted a maximum of one semester's credit for independent study.—one-third of a student's total point load during each semester should be taken outside his major. 111. Allowance should be made for a limited number of studentinitiated courses for juniors and seniors on the following bases: —at least 13 juniors and seniors, including the student proposer, must indicate their intention to* enroll for the course. Should the course fail to attain the requisite number of 13, it would be annulled, —each student-initiated course must have as a sponsor a member of the professorial faculty who will partake in all meetings and activities of the class. As this participation will count as part of his regular course load, the faculty, member must receive his department's approval to participate, —before 15 April of the academic year preceding the offering of the* course, the student-initiators of the course, with the participation 1 of the involved faculty member, will draw up a syllabus (including reading lists) to be presented for approval to the Committee on Instruction or a sub-committee appointed by it. Student-initiated courses will be subject to the regular grading procedure, —no student may take more than one such course a year; no faculty member may participate in more than one such course in an academic year. The undersigned is anxious to receive any comments, criticisms, or emendations. Daniel J. Leab Associate Dean for Academic Affairs September 1, 1970"
15,Art Humanities,On Academics II,21 October 1970,"The main goal of any academic reform proposal for the upper college, the sophomore through senior years, should be to minimize course requirements, yet maintain some structure of general education. In order to achieve an equilibrium between these two ends, the first and obvious step would be to approve the Galanter plan and make requirements for the major or concentrate optional. The second step towards requirement reduction necessitates a careful reevaluation of the current number of mandatory courses. Upperclassmen must now take two"" terms of second-year Contemporary Civilization, music humanities, art humanities, two years of mathematics or natural science, and must prove command of a foreign language, a knowledge equivalent to four or more semesters. This set of requirements is blatantly prohibitive. It forbids the exercise of individual choice in the selection of courses, and often forces a student into disciplines in which he has neither interest nor motivation. The plan submitted to the College faculty by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap makes an attempt to drastically reduce these requirements. He has recommended that CCB be dropped; that either music humanities or art humanities, but not both, be required; and that the science requirement be reduced to two terms. According to his plan, the language requirement would remain as is and College upperclassmen would be asked to take at least three terms of subjects ""remote from their major."" Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Daniel Leab, in his counter-proposal, called for two terms of social science; two terms of natural science, at: least one term being a laboratory course; two terms in formal and analytic thought; music humanities and art humanities; and a reading competence in a foreign language to be demonstrated by the end of the sophomore year. Neither plan is flawless, and both assume the continuation of the archaic major system. Assuming that the Galanter plan can be enacted, it appears that a mixture of both the Belknap and Leab proposals would best serve the interests of the students and the faculty. First of all, the natural science requirement must be reduced to two terms. Both reform plans agree on this principle, yet neither offer what should be the obvious corollary: all the poets' science courses should be abolished. It makes little sense to require •courses that are intellectually unsound and academically not rigorous. They should be abolished. Professor Belknap's recommendation that either art or music humanities be required appears to make sense. This change would lower the number of required courses and still make it possible for students to voluntarily elect to take both. The idea of two semesters in formal and analytic thought appears quite sound and innovative. This requirement should be met by specific courses in mathematics, philosophy and linguistics. And finally CCB. Yesterday I centered my criticism of the freshman year proposals on the weaknesses of CCA. Today, I center my complaints of the Leab and Belknap plans on the strengths of CCB. Both plans effectively call for the abolition of specific CCB courses, courses which in the past have proven intellectually stimulating and uniformly excellent. Some of the best offerings in the College, such as Professor Fritz Stern's European Modern History course, currently fulfill the CCB requirement. If the requirement must be tampered with at all, what should be done is to extend the number of courses meeting the requirement. Dropping CCB will be detrimental. The faculty when it meets tomorrow must consider all the pros and cons on the issue of academic reform. The most important duty for them, however, is not to quibble or harangue, but simply to act. The current system in the College is in need of immediate revision. — MARTIN FLUMENBAUM"
16,Art Humanities,Humanities May Abolish Pass-Fail,4 February 1971,"By GAIL ROBINSONArt and music humanities courses, which have been graded passfail for the past two years, may return to the traditional letter grade system next year. The humanities faculties have asked that letter grades be restored and it is expected that the Committee on Instruction will debate the proposal in the near future. The entire faculty must then approve it for the plan to take effect. Associate Professor of Art History David Rosand said yesterday that pass-fail was introduced as an experiment last year and that the instructors have ""had their highest hopes disappointed."" David Josephson, instructor of music, asserted yesterday that ""the majority of instructors are quite unhappy with pass-fail as it stands."" Professor Rosand said that last year the experiment was thought to be a success because it provided teachers with more freedom and placed less pressure on the student. This year, he explained, ""attendance has dropped tremendously"" and, because of the pass-fail system, humanities is ""the course that most students sacrifice."" He added that unless passfail ""is extended across the board, I don't think it makes much sense."" Professor Rosand had no explanation for why attendance had dropped off so sharply this year except that it may be due to ""the style of the semester and may apply to other courses as well."" He said that in an art humanities class of twenty-five students attendance would average only between 13 and 15, and added that the quality of' work has also declined.* Mr. Josephson asserted, ""I'm unhappy because the marking system seems to discourage serious attitudes."" ""There has been no opportunity to award any mark for distinction,"" and he further asserted that he would favor either a letter grade system or a pass with honors — pass—fail system. Professor Rosand claimed, however, that once the letter system is installed ""you're back to a grading system and you might as well admit it."" He said that he didn't see thatthe Committee on Instruction has any real alternative to approving the proposal because ""the staff feels so strongly about it."" Professor Rosand expressed hope that the faculty would also approve it and that there would be substantial debate."
17,Art Humanities,Faculty Approves Resolution For Interdepartmental Staffs,5 February 1971,"By FRED SCHNEIDERDespite the lack of a quorum, the College faculty yesterday approved the creation of interdepartmental staffs for Oriental Civilization and Freshman English sem-' inars. It also called on the College administration to seek budgetary control of all joint staffs, including the Contemporary Civilization A and Humanities A staffs. These recommendations were the final proposals of the Committee on Educational Policy to the faculty. The panel's report was originally submitted at a meeting last May. In addition, the faculty called on the Dean's office and the science departments to develop an interdepartmental staff for science courses that fulfill the one-year science requirement. The policy committee had recommended the creation of a science staff. However, the facultysuggested that this matter be handled by the Dean. Rules of the College faculty stipulate that 63 members, twenty per cent of its membership, are needed to constitute a quorum. The faculty, however, approved the resolution submitted by the committee by a vote of 32-6. Because no member objected to the vote despite the lack of a quorum, the vote was ruled legal. The faculty decided to submit another proposal of the Committee on Educational Policy to the interdepartmental staffs. This recommendation asks staff chairmen to select certain graduate students as interdepartmental preceptors. Interdepartmental preceptors would be graduate students who only teach in interdepartmental staffs. Since they would not be responsible to any department, they would be committed entirely to general education. Professors of Psychology John Nevin and Eugene Galanter agreed to table their motion calling for the abolition, of major and concentration requirements.Professor of Russian Robert A. Belknap, chairman of the Committee on Educational Policy, told the faculty that the proposals of his_ group had indicated its desire ""to further the move towards general education in the College."" The panel, now dissolved, had proposed six and ten point seminars for freshmen, the reduction of the math-science requirement to a one year science requirement, the substitution of distributional requirements for the second year of Contemporary Civilization, and the reduction of the second year of humanities to one semester of either art or music humanities. Professor Belknap added that the actions of the faculty in continuing to require Humanities A, CCA, and both music and art humanities, showed that body's commitment to the liberal arts tradition. He called on the faculty to fulfill this commitment by approving the resolution to create the Oriental Studies and freshman English seminar staffs. This proposal also allowed them to secure senior faculty members rather than any junior faculty or graduate students a department could spare. After the meeting, Professor Belknap explained that due to the passage of his committee's proposal, the Oriental Studies program, whcih currently draws instructors from the departments of East Asian languages and cultures, history, international affairs, Middle East languages and cultures, and religion, would be strengthened by its independence from the contributing departments and by the budgetary pressure the College administration would be able to exert. Dean Hovde commented on the meeting's lack of a quorum, noting that the Committee on Instruction had discussed the necessity of changing the faculty rules which govern the meetings and which specify the qualifications of a mem-ber of the College faculty. He also announced that the Dean's office would probably be able to exceed the ten per cent administrative cost cut-back called for in a directive from President McGill.Robert Belknap"
18,Art Humanities,Instruction Panel Endorses Pass-Fail for Humanities B,11 March 1971,"By DAN DOLGINThe College Committee on Instruction recommended yesterday that second year humanities instructors continue to grade their course on a mandatory pass-fail basis. Last semester many Humanities B instructors indicated a desire to return to traditional letter grading. Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Robert Randle said last night that the instructional panel convinced the Humanities B faculty ""that it might be a valuable idea to continue the pass-fail experiment for another year."" ""Many people on the faculty feel that all College requirements should be pass-fail,"" Dean Randle added. Dean' Randle, the panel's secretary, claimed that his ""attitude was that the evidence just isn't in yet"" on the effects of grading the music and art humanities courses pass-fail. He indicated that the general question of the College grading system will come up for committee discussion in the near future. The committee also continued its discussion of Professor of Political Science Wayne Wilcox's frequent absence from class, but Dean Randle said that he had ""no comment at all"" on thaf discussion., When the panel is investigating a particular professor, its members refuse to divulge any information pertaining to the investigation, as a matter of policy. Last week Michael Ornstein '71, a member of the Committee on Instruction, claimed at a corn-mittee meeting that Professor Wilcox was absent from his class for over five weeks during the first semester. Instructor of Art History Eugene Santomasso, a Humanities B instructor who received a perfect rating in last year's Course Evaluation Guide, said last night that the pass-fail grading has not greatly affected his section. ""Though the attendance fell a bit more this year than last, as far as I can tell the class went pretty much the same as always,"" commented the instructor. Assistant Professor of Art History Ellwood Parry, who also teaches art humanities indicated in a telephone interview that ""it depends upon the particular class."""
19,Art Humanities,Critics Pan Sarris Film Course,18 November 1971,"By FRED SCHNEIDERAndrew Sarris looks more like the assistant principal of your high school than an associate professor of film. With his baggy suit, receding hairline, dissolute pouches under the eyes, and a tendency to insert ""urn's"" and ""you know's"" when he is searching for the proper word, Professor Sarris seems much less eminent than by all rights he should, since he is one of the most important and respected American film critics.Yet, despite his unprepossessing appearance, Professor Sarris teaches a course that for the past two years hasbeen easily the most popular one in the College. In fact, the course is so popular that the students registered have been issued identification cards to gain admission to the class. The class has been moved to McMillin Theatre in Dodge Hall to accomodate the throngs that used to gather in Harkness Academic Theatre last year. At that time, Professor Sarris would enter to tumultuous applause, and make witty pronouncements on movies and film history that would reduce the class to helpless laughter. But that is no longer the case. The highly-privileged, ID cardtoting students now have an entire balcony in addition to a large auditorium, in which they have enough room to lounge, with their feet on neighboring chairs, and to watch Professor Sarris' performance on the stage. And many people now feel that the switch to McMillan has adversely affected the course. Equipped with a throat microphone, Professor Sarris resembles Johnny Carson giving his monologue, as he shifts from foot to foot and continually alternates between gathering hismicrophone cord and shoving his fists into his pockets. Unfortunately, there is no sense of intimacy, since his voice comes blaring from four large speakers located at the front of the auditorium. Last year, Professor Sarris could reduce his audience to hysterics with a witty comment on Stanley Kramer's distorted world-view, or the observation that Jerry Lewis typifies Americans to the French. This year, however, his wit is lost in the roar of amplified sound, and his students barely snicker as they wait to view the film classic that follows his lecture. Professor Sarris himself complained about his role as a performer last week, commenting that he is ""wired for sound, while the students can't hear each other. ""Most intelligent and sensible people don't always speak out,"" he noted, adding that he was left to shout down the few souls who do ask questions and challenge his opinions. Unlike the well-structured course given for the past two years, this year's version of ""Wednesday Night at the Movies"" is a potpourri of filmdom's finest in which students don't know whether to expect a silent Russian film by Sergei Eisenstein or a nouvelle vague film by Jean-Luc Godard.""People would become very depressed by the number of silent films if I were to present the entire silent era,"" the film professor explained. As a result, the course, some students commented, appears disjointed and is very confusing to novices who cannot accurately follow the development of film-making and directing techniques. Many of the students in the course indicated that they had registered for it because they hoped to learn more about film and to take a course that they thought would not be academically rigorous. In fact, the grade for the semester is based-solely on one piece of work— a five-page essay on some aspect of film. Professor Sarris suggests that a report on a book about film or a movie review is acceptable. Most students choose to review a movie they've seen recently. ""I thought it would be an interesting gut,"" one student interviewed last night commented. ""Having taken art humanities and music humanities, it seemed natural to take a course on film. But ""I've found 'Wednesday Night at the Movies' very bcring,"" he added. ""I'd rather choose which movies to watch on Wednesday night by looking through TV Guide.""__Academic GourmetAndrew Sarris"
20,Art Humanities,Action on Grading Dismays Students,28 March 1973,"By TED GREENA majority of students questioned yesterday said they opposed the College faculty's decision to abolish pass-fail for art and music humanities. However a sizeable minority, all of whom have already taken the courses, declared that they supported the faculty decision on the grounds it might force students ""to learn something."" There was widespread disagreement over the validity of the faculty's contention that letter grades in humanities would encourage students to take the courses more seriously. ""Grading will not stimulate studying among disinterested students,"" Steven Sims '73C said yesterday. ""Those who did well in the courses did so because they enjoyed them."" ""As much as I hate to admit it, it's a good idea,"" Gabriel Verrt 73C commented. ""If the idea is tolearn about art and music then the courses should be graded."" However, Gary Kleeman 75C predicted, ""If forced to work and forced to learn something, students will gain something of value from the course."" ""Art humanities was a waste of time,"" Thomas Campbell '75C recalled. ""Students refused to participate and it was impossible for the instructor to take it seriously."" The most vociferous objections to the faculty's decision were voiced by students who felt the new grading system would place an extra burden on students. ""I was looking forward to not being pressured by these subjects,"" Roby Toggweiler '75C said, adding the faculty decision had all but destroyed his hopes. David Arm '75C admitted, ""No one does the work in my art humanities course,"" but added ""with all the other requirements,grading the courses would overburden the students."" Other students shared senior Jack Girgenti's idea that the courses should continue to be passfail because ""they are not courses which are in the mainstream of what most people are used to taking."" ""People are willing to put up with a cultural imposition on them as long as it's not too much of a hass/le,"" Richard Levine '74C remarked. Most students questioned praised the concept of art and music humanities. ""While I didn't get too involved in the subjects, I was glad to have taken the courses and to have gotten something out of them,"" Jerome Sanchy '74C, who praised the faculty decision, commented. Angus Harrigan '75C said he profitted from the courses which he found to be ""designed for people with little or no background in the subjects."" In explaining his support of the faculty decision, Harrigan recalled ""people didn't show up and the teacher had no control over the students."" Marc Chanfaglione '73C proposed ""students should have an option of receiving a grade if they want."" He said that while he ""did not get much out of the courses,"" he ""would have enjoyed taking them under a (letter) grading system."" On Monday, the faculty voted unanimously to end pass-fail grading for art and music humanities beginning next year. At the faculty meeting, Dean Pouncey and Professor of Music Joel Newman urged adoption of the letter grading system which the Committee on Instruction approved by a vote of ten to two last week. Observing that these were the only academic courses with mandatory pass-fail, Professor Newman stated, ""It's to the students best interest to make these courses just like our other courses."" Students in the College are required to take a letter grade in all required courses except physical education."
21,Art Humanities,Tenure Casualty Santomasso Will Leave Columbia,10 April 1973,"Santomasso Will Leave ColumbiaBy DAVID SMITHAssistant Professor of Art History Eugene Santomasso, whose course in Modern Architecture is one of the most popular courses taught at the College, disclosed yesterday that he will leave the university at the end of the spring term because there is ""little hope"" he will receive tenure in the next two years. Professor Santomasso, who has been teaching at the College for five years, stated that although Dean Pouncey has encouraged him to stay an additional year, the uncertainty of the job situation ""has made it necessary to think more about my family."" The 34-year-old professor is currently considering job offers from Queens College and Brooklyn College. He noted that the arrival of these two offers at the same time contributed to his decision to leave. ""The two offers really don't offer much,"" he commented, ""but I definitely want to stay in New York. I'm committed to the city. I felt that if I didn't accept one of the offers another offer to teach in the city might not be forthcoming in the next few years."" Although Professor Santomasso stated that he is not ""bitter"" about the improbability of his receivingtenure at Columbia, he said ""It is a shame that I have to leave now that the new architecture major has been developed."" Last week, Robert Stern, a lecturer in the School of Architecture, called Professor Santomasso the ""father"" of the new major. ""I hate to leave,"" he commented, ""just when the treatment of the subject is really getting interesting."" Professor Santomasso, whocurrently teaches three courses in the College, said he will ""miss the Columbia students. They are very challenging and really get involved with architecture."" ""If T'm ever asked to return to the College,"" he declared, ""I'd come back in a second under the right conditions. I understand the department's reasons for not giving me tenure. I really haven't published much."" Professor Santomasso beganteaching the Modern Architecture course to students in the School of General Studies in the fall of 1967. The course has been lauded by the Columbia-Barnard Course Guide as a class ""for anyone who needs a class they would be upset to miss."" In assessing the changes that have occurred in the university since he arrived at Columbia in the mid-sixties, the young professor remarked, ""After the 'revolution' in the spring of 1968, greater avenues of connection were made between students and teachers. Teachers now understand more about what students want and why they want it. Teachers have become very receptive."" Contacted yesterday, Acting Chairman of the Art History Department Howard McP. Davis praised Professor Santomasso for having ""increased the interest inthe subject of architecture here at Columbia,"" and he stated that he is ""distressed that Professor Santomasso has decided to leave."" Several students contacted yesterday expressed regret that Professor Santomasso had decided to leave the College. ""There was always something special about getting into his Art Humanities class,"" one junior asserted. ""His section would always be filled up immediately after registration began."" One student, who majors in art history, commented, ""He's always accessible and very easy to talk to. He really helped me get turned on to art history as a major."" ""This whole thing really upsets me,"" another student declared. ""He's the only teacher in the entire department who really cares about his students. How can they let him go?""Eugene Santomasso"

23,Art Humanities,The Outside from the Inside,27 February 1975,"By RAY F. PATIENTArt humanities students, art history majors, and art students will be able to escape the effacing humdrum of their discipline this weekend at a unique exhibit in Ferris Booth Hall's Art Gallery. All visitors to the second floor showroom will confront the works by artists legally ostracized from society: inmates at New York's Green Haven Correctional Facility. It's an exacting task—contemplating the expressions of convicts whose perception of society can be seen as far removed from that of the academic community, supposedly society's most astute critic. But there may be an invaluable advantage in viewing the world from its Bastilles. When you've got nothing to lose, there may be nothing you fear to say. Thirteen painters (four unidentified, five photographers, and many ceramics workers are included. All the works are on sale, ninety per cent winding up in the inmate's pocket, the other ten covering shop expenses.The Art Gallery will be open Friday from noon to 5 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (as part of Dean's Day activities), and Monday from 1 to 5 p.m. The show opened last weekend. Despite technical unsophistication, the convicts's art rips away the veil shadowing their lives to reveal their pain, their hope, and their indignation. ""I don't consider myself an artist, not in the sense of the old masters,"" said Leon Sekunda, ""but I firmly believe if one is creative, one can paint with shit."" That boldness resounds throughout the exhibit. Vicky Szerko, a student manager of the gallery, said, ""Some of the works are quite professional though others are not. The exhibit is, then, more of a social statement than an aesthetic experience."" How often her words were to echo in my head as I zig-zagged through the exhibit. On first viewing, orderly procession from piece to piece is nearly impossible, the impact of so many diverting me from each grouping. The bravery of statement hits hard. A potential master of surrealism, Rattan Hall encounters from any realm of art no challengers equalling his courageous insights into the nature of sex and sexuality. Three of his paintings (there are seven by him on display) approach phallic fantasies. In Contradiction VI, penises are hurled into a trash can. Contradiction IV unfurls a panoply of mauve erections, a lusting couple ensconced inside one of them. Hall's tour de ""orce, Juggernaut, depicts succinctly exactly what its title implies. Willie Hamilton achieves the mosthighly distinct style of all the displayed artists. His simplicity succeeds for the same reasons that the primativeness of Grandma Moses was recognized: clarity and vividness. His art let me know him more personally that any of the others do. Leon Sekunda underscores the potency the media has usurped in contemporary times. ""If it weren't for"" zeroes in on the pronounced coolness of the shapely blond subject of the recent Winston commercials. Her cold, piercing eyes detail a sweeping condemnation of hipness for its own sake. Ibrahim Abdul Wahid's (aka Ronald Lee Williams's) Ghetto Wall achieves both a realist and a surrealist effect, depending on the distance from which its remnant paint chips are viewed. Confusion reigns in the exhibit, however. Except for Hamilton's, the paintings of no single artist are grouped together. This is the fault of the limited wall space of the gallery itself, but it makes comparison and contrast of an artist's works extremely tedious. Political awareness invades the photographic work of Richard Convoy. His print of the Attica exercise yard (in the aftermath of its riots superimposed overwhich is a mug of a decidedly pensive Nelson Rockefeller) poignantly sums up Attica's shedding of truth and tears. 'In a society bombarded with influences geared to focus on the manipulations of the slave masters,"" Conroy writes, ""one must consciously force aside the fun and games and look to realities."" Conroy's photos reflect his philosophy. Exceptions to the overwhelming ""statements"" spirit of the exhibit, the ceramics are more easily judged on aesthetic grounds. All the pieces were finished in high-gloss glaze. Although it detracts from the more flambuoyantly colored works (the dark blue and white), it succeeds in rendering the more subtly colored pieces elegant. Appreciating them, however, is arduous. None of the three glass cases benefit from the many adjustable ceiling lights. Except for the ones haloing the few scattered groups of seats, the lamps are allraimed at the walls (though not all hangings are justly lit). Chuck Delaney, one of the co-ordinators who got this exhibit together, explained that the paintings came out of three art programs the Green Haven facility of-fers: a high school, a hobby shop, and a college level division. ""The people we're exhibiting here are committed to the art scene as an alternative to, say, basketball, one of the more popular activities at prisons. ""It's a refuge from the more brutish aspects of prison life. Most outsiders aren't aware of it, but there is a tremendous amount of arts and crafts at prisons."" Delaney himself is more involved as an instructor at Green Haven's photography programs, which are sponsored by the Floating Foundation of New York, a non-profit photographyteaching organization located at a 79th Street marina boathouse. The foundation provides basic, intermediate, and advanced training and weekday access to darkroom facilities for the Green Haven inmates. Those who are advanced run the basic classes. Delaney said he felt they were tougher than most teachers. ""Charles Shuman flunks one-half of his class of basic students."" (Shuman's work is on display in Ferris Booth). Ratton Hall evokes that sense of dedication in a statement he wrote about his philosophy of art: ""Maybe duress is the ideal condition for the cultivation of expression. . .creativity,together with talent and genius is in fact a form of freedom. ""Eventually I will gain the physical release of pseudofreedom. . .until the appointedtime. . .1. . .will indeed continue to make magic through creativity."" And magic these men have made.Ibrahim Abdul Wahid Pauses at his Easel in a Green Haven Painting Studio.Vicky Szerko Examines Richard Convoy's Work."
24,Art Humanities,FEEDBACK Timely Warning,13 September 1976,"Timely WarningHaving just completed my second year of registration and book buying I would like to bring two frustrating facts to Barnard students' attention. If a Barnard student pre-registers the preceeding semester for a sectioned Columbia course it means nothing. In order to take the course she must\ register with Columbia College students on the usual first come first served basis. Returning Barnard students should note that this means coming into the City before the dorms open just to register. Examples of sectioned courses are C.C., Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. Columbia students will be interested to learn that they must pre-register in the preceeding semester for Barnard's sectioned courses (i.e.: Poet's Physics, Psychology 5, Economics 1). Even if you do register and/or pre-register for these classes there is no guarantee that you will not be bumped because of last minute changes in sections (like the one that occurred this semester in the Music Department.) A second source of irritation is the Barnard I.D. card. The temporary I.D. and the I.D. cards of the class of 1979 do not bear signatures. Without a signature verification the Columbia Bookstore does not like to accept a personal check, so be prepared for a possible hassle. If program filing goes well my faith in Alma Mater will be restored. A ~ _ April Sparnaugle, '79 Barnard"
25,Art Humanities,C.U. Course Guide in review—heading for an identity crisis?,18 April 1977,"By TOM SOTEREveryone knows the Course Guide. Freshmen recognize it as the book they are given at orientation as a guidepost for their schedules. Teachers know it as an indicator of what the students think of them. But does anyone really know what it's supposed to do? ""It's supposed to provide a consumer report on the quality of instruction,"" says Harold Lehmann, a former Course Guide editor. ""It should be used to point out flaws and improve teaching where necessary."" But how effective is it in this role? Students' feelings can be best summed up by Barnard junior Lauren Sontag's comment that ""Using the Course Guide alone to plan my courses would be like using a horoscope as the only way to plan my life. It's not always accurate."" And James Feldman, a Humanities instructor, feels that the teacher critiques are not always as helpful as they could be, although he does admit that the book's reference to his excessive smoking did make him kick the habit. If these views are representative, why is there such a wide divergence between what the Course Guide editors intend and what actually comes across? Barnard professor George Kelling is especially hostile to certain aspects of the Course Guide. ""Being a psychologist and a statistician,"" he says, ""I can say that the level of sophistication with which Course Guide analyzes data is —atrocious is too weak a work and criminal is too strong—incredibly stupid and moronic. The interpretation of the descriptions is slapdash and not very systematic and there are systematic ways of analyzing that stuff and getting an objective picture of what the students think. It's called content analysis."" ""We would like a more rigorous statistical analysis,"" explains co-editor Brian Guillorn, ""but we are pressed for help."" One student, who transferred this year from Binghamton, feels that the criticism of the numbers is unjust. ""It could be worse,"" he says, citing the confusing numbers system in his former school's course guide. ""The Stony Brook course guide,"" adds Lehmann, ""is mostly numbers. It looks like a telephone book, and is probably just as helpful."" One freshman thinks that the numbers system should be junked altogether and a comparative ratings scale, somewhatanalagous to a Top Ten list, should be instituted instead. English Professor Ann Douglas feels that such an idea would defeat the purpose of Course Guide. ""It shouldn't be comparative,"" she says. ""Popularity and ratings are terms that have more to do with public relations than with teacher criteria."" ""If Course Guide had an explicit philosophy of what kind of teaching stylesare preferred and why,"" adds Professor Kelling, ""the whole thing would be better. As it is now, they will praise a teacher for one thing and downgrade another for the same thing. It's gratuitous."" Beyond inconsistencies, however, many professors complain that Course Guide is too eager to amuse, and in the process sacrifices accuracy and a great deal of its credibility. ""I don't think Course Guide is the place to mention my looks,"" says Professor Douglas, ""since they aren't relevant to how I present the material. Course Guide is there swerving from its function of giving a microcosm of response of those students who have just taken the course. It should give a sense of the instructor's ability to convey, the worth of the material and what the class was like. In that regard, the looks of the instructor arenot relevant."" ""I've had complaints on particular quotes selected,"" admits Acting Dean Robert Belknap. ""Sometimes Course Guide does select quotes for picturesqueness as well as for revelatory qualities. But I get the impression that they're careful with their statistics."" Herbert Broderick, an Art Humanities instructor, is not as critical. ""In a shocking kind of way,"" he says of the descriptions, ""one recognizes oneself immediately,"" As far as inaccuracy goes, he feels that the blame is not entirely with Course Guide. ""One should also take into account the moods of the writer,"" he explains. ""A flashy quote might come to mind as a way to get into Course Guide, but not be as fair as a duller one."" And Mr. Feldman thinks that many of the descriptions are divorced from reality. ""I know two professors with whom I've discussed the Course Guide who have had the same experience,"" he says, ""panned one year and praised the next. They teach the same way every year, however. I think there's a lot of capriciousness in writing and selecting quotes."" Co-editor Brian Guillorn has another explanation. ""The opposite of a selffulfilling prophecy can occur. A teacher might get good ratings for a number of years and his classes will mushroom. The intimacy that made his class popular will vanish and his ratings will go down because the new students are not satisfied. The teacher's the same, but the class is different."" Another reason, though much less common, is offered by Dave Gorman. ""One year a senior did an elaborate job of forging questionaires of an excellent professor. He used different pencils, different handwriting, etc. He mauled the guy. But that was so elaborate, and so rare, that we didn't see through it."" The technique involved in preparing the Course Guide usually precludes this sort of thing. At the end of each term, teachers are asked to hand out questionaires evaluating their performances. After they are filled out, they are supposed to be returned, unread by the professor, to the Course Guide offices. This is done to maintain the confidentiality which the editors feel is essential for honest response, although the questionaires are anonymous. Once returned, the information is tabulated by a team of wirters, who usuallyknow something about the subjects covered in the courses. Ratings are formed and descriptions written with everyone trying to be as fair, and as entertaining, as possible. Two books are released, a winter one, out in April (3000 copies), which covers the upcoming fall courses, utilizing the questionaires from the previous fall; and a spring supplement, released in December (1400 copies) which covers the springcourses with questionaire material from the previous spring. As far as the distribution of questions goes, all the editors strees the voluntary nature of the action on the teachers' part. And therein lies another of the problems that students frequently complain about. ""After I pick a course,"" says Barnard junior Allison Gold, ""I look in the Course Guide to find it and usually can't. And these are often huge lecture courses.'' What happens, according to Harold Lehmann, is that a number of teachers never give out the questionaire. ""One teacher wouldn't let us review him,"" explains the former editor. ""So the following year we hunted out his students individually, and our questions to them substantiated what we thought: He was a poor teacher. After he was rated, however, students who took hiscourse liked it more because they knew what to expect."" These expectations are another possible problem. Is there an element of selffulfillment at work, with students interpreting teachers' actions by preconceived ideas based on the descriptions? Those questioned didn't think so. ""I'll form my own opinion,"" says Alan Miller. ""I don't think there's self-fulfillment,"" agrees Professor Kelling. ""Initially, maybe, but by the time you've had students for a semester that effect is not very powerful."" Another question asked by students is why the university keeps on professors who consistently get bad ratings. Does the Course Guide have even less influence on administrators that it apparently does oh students? ""We don't do much hiring or firing these days, so the question of influence doesn't come up much,"" explains Dean Belknap. ""We of course consider teaching when we fire and the Course Guide is one of the methods we use."" But does it really have an effect on the area that it does cover? ""My teaching is influenced a little,"" says Professor Douglas. ""But it's hard to find a general rule since each class is unique in how you approach it and what they say about that approach. And you aren't really being judged on your sense of the material, but on your presentation."" ""Course Guide is helpful,"" says Mr. Broderick, ""because it gives you some indication of which way you're going, up or down. Without Course Guide, it's hard to get a sense of how the class is seeing you. It's a partial help in structuring the course."" But Mr. Broderick also feels that the descriptions can present problems if taken too literally. ""The student might be looking for the entertainment value of the course,"" he explains. ""A teacher might get criticized if his style is not full of jokes. It begins to dictate a whole approach, a Johnny Carson syndrome. The danger is that the teacher's talents might be short-changed because of expectations for a particular style."" One freshman thinks that the Course Guide does more harm than good. ""I was closed out of all Course Guide's recommended classes,"" he complains, ""and had to take whatever fit into my schedule."" This opinion is a common one, but in spite of it, most students feel that the book is necessary. ""It's good for new students,"" says Francis Milliken, C'7B. ""Throughit, they're able to get the students' opinions of a teacher instead of an advisor's. I try to keep in mind, however, that it's just other people's opinions and not facts. What I may be looking for might be different from what others want."" The editors admit that there are problems with the Course Guide and that it is still in an evolutionary stage. ""It would be good if we could use the Course Guide to push for things students want,"" says Lehmann. ""There's a lot of uncorrelated information sitting around. For example, how many juniors and sophomores take Humanities? The Administration thinks only freshmen do. We know that's not so. If we just took the time to tabulate things we normally asked, we could find out a lot more. Why do people take the courses they do? Through more directed questioning, we could find out more about the students and use that information to improve classes."" ""Course Guide will have to evolve a new purpose,"" admits Gorman, ""reviewing individual courses will no longer be enough."" One junior, at least, is happy with things the way they are. ""I like the idea that the book is funny,"" she says. ""Who wants to be bombarded with all that serious bullshit, anyway?"" Who indeed, and the consensus is that, though flawed, the Course Guide does provide a valuable service, without which students and teahcers would certainly lack not only a scapegoat, but an important guidepost, as well."
26,Art Humanities,FORUM Is the College perpetrating intellectual fraud?,27 October 1977,"Is the College perpetrating intellectual fraud?By JIM SCHACHTERColumbia College's image of itself as a center for liberal education is intellectually fraudulent. The fellow who writes in the front of the College bulletin that ""a career in Columbia College centers on the work in general education and in the academic department of one's major"" is either a liar or a fool. The College is not a locus of humane learning because the undergraduates enrolled in it are not members of an intellectual community. A career here centers not on general or major area studies, not on anything else that is a subarea or function of the instructional facets of the university. Instead, a large portion of the College's enrollees choose to allow extra-university, extra-intellectual activities to dominate their time and interest during their stay here. And rightly so. It is fitting that students do not take an interest in their college, because their college takes no interest in them. The circle works like this: Columbia College lets its students go their own way; then the students allow the College to go its separate way; and then the College, figuring that its students don't care about it, decides that it is hopeless to try to involve students in authentic, intense learning, let alone making decisions that effect the day-to-day and long range operation of the university. What are the results of this diffusion of student interests? For the students, the result is sophistication. We forget that ""sophistication"" has a perjorative connotation. The sophisticate is one who, mainly familiar with the superficial aspects of life, exists in the realm of superficiality. Many of Columbia's undergraduates choose to attend this school because it is in New York, America's cultural center. These students get through their classes, often gaining good marks, but their major interest is in some aspect of the city's cultural life. The culture lovers can be divided into two groups. First are those interested in mastering a particular artistic skill—musicians, dancers, sculptors, actors—or in authentically understanding an art. Such individuals subsume their lives to their interest and associate with others equally engaged in gaining aesthetic ability or comprehension. That is, these primary lovers of culture participate in an intellectual community centered on their interest, no doubt finding members of that community both within the university and without. The second group of culture lovers is composed of those who merely admire the arts, that is, the sophisticates. When a new ballet company comes to town, they're off to watch it. A new Italian movie? Seeing it soon after its release is a must. The sophisticate is obligated to be current in his area of sophistication. He must know what operas are on the Met's calendar for the next year, and it doesn't hurt to be familiar with the backstage bickering that resulted in that calendar. These are thethings the sophisticate thinks about and discusses. He is truly fascinated by such details and believes he is an expert of sorts. ""Yet how different is it to be an expert in the comings and goings of dramas than in the comings and goings of Jackie Onassis? And where is the greater show of profundity in knowing what movies ought to be ""important"" next fall rather than knowing what shoes will be in style at Christmas-time. We condemn the person who worries about celebrities as a gossip, and call the fashion-plate vain. Both are guilty of superficiality. And so, clearly enough, is that second kind of culture lover found around Columbia, the sophisticate. And just as he who is concerned about celebrities when he is eighteen is concerned about celebrities when he is thirty-six, so the sophisticated college student will be the sophisticated young and middle-aged adult. I assert that, in great measure, the people Columbia College is turning out arewhat the sophisticated media refer to as ""the Beautiful People."" Their jobs are ""right""; their clothes are ""right""; their friends are ""right""; their interests are ""right."" And they are hulks hopelessly awash in a sea of superficiality. Columbia is entwined in a web of sophistication. The political sophisticates, for example, place posters around campus to announce meetings in support of every nationalist movement imaginable. The members of Ethiopian and Chilean and Zionist solidarity groups all primarily exhibit a superficial and selfish understanding of the world. Consumed with the defense of one nationality's interests, usually their own, they are as egocentric as the Beautiful People, except that they are concerned with the self-importance of one national among all the nations rather than that of one person among humanity. How is Columbia College to blame for the fact that is producing superficial, selfish sophisticates?It is at fault because it does not demand its students' attention. It does not care whether the young men with whose liberal education it is entrusted ever gain the curiosity, knowledge, and judgment an education should imspire and provide. One might argue that Columbia students attend those unique Contemporary Civilization and Humanities classes which are designed to broaden minds and force and force young people to form defensible opinions. As far as this picture is reality, C.C. and Hum are the best things the College has to offer. However, as anyone who has sat in a required general education class knows, C. C. and Hum. are not necessarily dynamic intellectual experiences. Reading is not done. A few people, not always the best informed, dominate discussion. The essentials of each text may not be touched on. Too many of the students, then, do not care about the classes. Why don't they care? They don't carebecause the College has told them it doesn't care whether the students learn anything in the socalled ""core"" courses. Inane discussion is tolerated. Nonreading is not questioned. Mediocre papers receive above average marks. And, let's face it: just about everyone gets a good grade at the end of the term.* The general education classroom is not an intellectual community; rather it is the bedchamber of mediocrity. And the administrators and faculty of Columbia College are to blame for the mediocrity. They set the standards. How may Columbia's claim to being a bastion of liberal education be made valid? First, more must be expected of the student in the classroom. If a student is to get a good grade, he must learn. If he is to master the subject area of a general education course, he must read the books upon which the class discussions and written work are based. Teachers must be set free to force compliance with these learning rules; they must be allowed and even told to give spot quizzes that check for reading and comprehension, to weight marks heavily on the basis of intelligent participation in daily discussion, to be sure a paper is of high quality before it is given a good mark. (I do not suggest that good grades should be the final cause of learning. However, in the transistional period preceding the establishment of an intellectual community in the College, the use of grades to evaluate quality of learning might motivate students to dedicate themselves to their work.) If this commitment to deeper understanding of the great ideas of all times makes it impossible to read all the books presently covered, let the reading lists be cut. We cannot understand everything; we ought to understand something. Second, the university must develop a program which allows students to meet and converse intelligently with each other and with representatives of the faculty and administration on a regular, informal, but required basis. A setting wherein six or seven students are invited to a professor's apartment for a homecooked meal (paid for by the university) could well be an opportunity for the students and instructor to enlighten each other. The important issues of the moment could be discussed more fully than a class setting allows. The university recognizes the value of such discussions. Among the better kept secrets of the College is its John Jay National Scholars program, which honors the top one per cent of the freshman class. Its main selling point is a monthly dinner attended by the ten or twelve scholars, and an administrator or two, a faculty member, and a celebrated person from the New York area. Whyshould such an opportunity for mind-broadening be limited to an elite of the College? Am I advocating a return to paternalism? Not really. Intensified core courses and dinnerdiscussions with professors in attendance would not have the effect of making students accept a body of opinions handed down the the Benevolent Fathers of the College. Rather, such profound learning activities would more likely be cells of enlightenment. The better informed and wiser a man becomes today, the better able he is to see the faults in the make-up of the world, and the more likely he is to take action to improve humanity. This campus, like many others, exploded in violent rejection of the ways of the world in tin the late 1960s because groups of serious students met to study and discuss issues of worldwide significance in an historical context. And if those students had cooperated with their teachers, if the two groups hadbeen co-learners, the 60s movement might have had a firmer intellectual and practical basis. In France, where the agitators of the 60' s were a coalition of students and teachers and workers, the Left now has the chance to take control of the government. Neither am I proposing the nurture of ascetic eggheads. Again, the person of learning is bound to appreciate the complexities of the work, haveheightened passions, and care deeply about many facets of culture. He'll be interested in theatre, music, sport, dance, humor, realizing that to understand the harmious and conflicting relationships of these is to understand a large part of humanity. The intellectual will enjoy, intellectually. With the adoption of these"
27,Art Humanities,Summer enrollment increases 5%,1 June 1978,"By MITCH ROLLNICKSummer Session enrollment has increased by about five per cent over last year, according to Summer Session Director Peter Shamonsey. Shamonsey said that as of May 22, ther*e were 2,008 students enrolled in the first session. Of those, 1,517 were Columbia students and 491 were from outside the university. Last year there was a total enrollment of 3,164 in the two sessions. Shamonsey said the first session is usually more popular. He said he was ""pleased"" with the enrollment increase.There are about the same number of courses being offered this year as were offered last year, and Shamonsey said he ""doubted"" there are any in non-airconditioned rooms."" Summer Session collected about $1 million in tuition last year. Shamonsey said that this year's Summer Session was only hoping to equal last year's enrollment. He said that this was mainly due to a 10 per cent increase in tuition that was thought to have discouraged an increase in enrollments. Most. people taking summer courses tend to be enrolled in reauired courses, ""pre-med andart humanities courses,"" according to Shamonsey. He said courses at the professional schools, especially Social Work and Journalism, are also popular. There are no figures yet on course by course enrollment. The Summer Session office also funds the Earl Hall Center during the summer. Shamonsey said they were being provided with approximately $10,000 this year. Susan Harris, who is running the Earl Hall summer program, said some of the activities for the summer are: Cinematheque (a weekly movie), a newsletter, a daily ""tea-time,"" a weekly tea with an administrator or faculty' member, dance and poetry performances, an arts and crafts fair, and walking tours of New York.So, you were caught in yesterday's rain storm?

28,Art Humanities,"But hell, I'm dreaming",20 March 1980,"By THEODORE J. JOHNSON IIThe weekend of February 15-17 was important for Black recruiting at Columbia. The Black Recruitment Committee of the College Admissions Office and Black Student Organization sponsored its first, of hopefully many ""Black Applicant's Academic Weekend."" The weekend was an outstanding success. We hosted 62 applicants who had travelled from as far as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dayton. Most applicants enjoyed themselves immensely. By the end of the weekend, many of the applicants now preferred Columbia to the other Ivy league schools. This, after all, was what the promotional weekend was supposed to do anyway. But the weekend was a success because we engaged in a small game of deception. The Columbia that we presented really is not the Columbia that exists from day to day. We promoted the social aspects, briefly told what it was like to go to school here, and concealed the numerous prejudices manifested by this university. If the ap-plicants had had the opportunity to spend some time with us, they would have noticed that there are not too many Black students in the college. And, as for Black professors, to say that they do not exist is not that inaccurate. Minority recruitment at Columbia is, for all practical purposes, the responsibility of the various ethnic student organizations. In the case of Black recruitment, about 15 students do all the work. The group recruits nationally with an extensive spring follow up program. In addition to our February weekend we in conjunction with the other Black organizations sponsor a Black pre-freshman weekend in Appil. Our other duties include the production of recruitment publications, the strengthening of ties between Black students and alumni, and conducting campus tours. College seniors take an active role in the admissions process by conducting interviews and evaluating applications for the entering freshman class. We students already have too much work to do without theburden of travelling for a week just to sustain the low, 4.7 per cent Black population in this institution. We all know the College Admissions office has problems. The Black recruiting budget is only 50 per cent of that of any other Ivy league school and currently we do not have an officer responsible for Black recruiting. Perhaps this situation will change with the appointment of a minority admissions oficer next fall but I doubt it. Instead, I suspect that this officer will find out what we of the committee already know. That other than the prestige of being an Ivy league school (for what that's worth?), Columbia has few amenities to offer the Black student. Often on our recruiting trips we find that the forces of H,Y,& P have previously succeeded in convincing Black high school seniors to apply and later attend their institutions. They succeed because they can offer such things as Black Studies Programs, Black professors, a large Black population, and finally meaningful financial support. When asked if we can do the same, the answer, much to our embarrassment, is no. It should be aparent that the admissions office is not entirely responsible for the meager Black population at Columbia. Institutions of Columbia's caliber should address more than formal academic topics; the university should be an integral part, of the community. But if you look at Columbia and especially Columbia's course offerings, you would think that the school was located around 60th and Park rather than in Morningside Heights. Columbia through its curriculum, effectively excludes New York's Black Population. This should not be. Columbia has one of the greatest sources of information right next door, Harlem. There is not reason why this school should not have the best Black studies program in the country on its campus. Likewise there should be a center for Hispanics too. Programs such as these would benefit the white population at this university too. Few students realize the cultural center Harlem once was for New York. The fact that the region hasdeteriorated should be the focus •of someone's study. Once again, why couldn't that research be based at Columbia. It is scary to think of the resources, but blocks away, that are being wasted. Forever. But hell, I'm dreaming. Returning to the present, for many Black college students,, the heart of this disparity is Columbia's core liberal arts curriculum. In principle the program is not bad. Through structured survey courses of humanities, students are supposed to be introduced to new ideas and beliefs. But in reality the program is very biased. Our humanities section is poor because it recognizes only the dominant culture. This complaint is not one held by minorities either. A case inpoint is Contemporary Western Civilization more commonly known in Black circles as Contemporary White Civilization. Our faculty seems to think that Asia and Africa do not exist. This analogy need not be restricted to CC either. When was the last time you heard any Asian and African music in Music Humanities? And for an art survey course, the absence of Oriental and African art in Art Humanities makes studying the Greek Parthenon, seem like a study of current events. The reason for this omission as told by one instructor is the ""primitive nature"" of the two cultures. j Black students must ""serve time"" enduring a core curriculum that means relatively little to them. That time isn't cheap either; nominally it is $4,000 of tuition. This is the reality facing the Black applicant to Columbia. The insensitivity to minority - concerns should not be a characteristic of institutions of higher learning and particularly Columbia, scene of student consciousness in 1968. High power recruiting may change the number of Black students on campus, but a more effective measure would be for the university administration to respond to Black needs both on and off campus. Only then will Black recruitment cease to be a problem.Theodore J. Johnson 11, a junior in the College, is a member of the College's Black recruitment committee."
29,Art Humanities,Disrobing Alma Mater,28 August 1980,"By LEONow that you're finally here, it's the appropriate moment for the process of demystification to begin. First of all, a few handy terms: GUT: Nothing to do with the gastro-intestinal tract, mainly because guts are of little interest to pre-meds, who take things like organic chemistry, by definition the antithesis of a gut. Known variously as a cinch, a mickey mouse course, a tit, etc., the gut is to be found primarily in the area of required courses. Maps for Japs, Rocks for Jocks, and Physics for Poets are examples. But the determined gut-hunter will find one in almost any field of endeavor. GRUB: Sometimes coincides with a nerd. Someone who takes no guts and can frequently be found in the so-called grub room of any campus dorm at night, when any self-respecting student is out playing pinball or drinking beer. PREPPIE: The wide use of this term to describe almost anyone who even whispers ""LaCoste"" or so much as window shops at Brooks Brothers is symptomatic of the student body's collective inferiority complex. Everyone here either wishes he were at Harvard or Yale or hates those who do.INCOMPLETE: Does not refer to the way you feel after you've failed to score at the Pub. It's what you get when you haven't completed all the required work for a course before the end of the term. Some are proud of their Inc's; indeed, they flaunt them. But it's best to avoid the dreaded Inc. unless you enjoy spending your Christmas vacation in Butler Library. DEAN: Someone who avoids you when you want to see him, and who you avoid when he wants to see you. ADVISER: His secretary signs your course-selection card. ACADEMIC PROBATION: Trouble. Guts really are necessary if you - intend to do anything significant outside of schoolwork. They're also a good way to,avoid deans, incompletes and academic probation. The earnest freshman will probably experience pangs of guilt when he signs up for his first gut, but he will soon learn that the benefits far outweigh the toll on his conscience. The best guts are those taught by eminent profs, because they are both easy and interesting. The biggies tend to teach these courses because they're too wrapped up in their research or whatever else they do to bother reading 20 page papers on the categorical imperative.The best way to find good, gutty courses is to get some experienced upperclassman to take you under his wing and show you the ropes. The most notorious guts are usually quite well-known around campus, but there is one drawback, which I call reverse peristalsis syndrome: the prof, aghast at reading his favorable review in Course Guide (""Take it. It's an easy A,"" accompanied by a 5.0 difficulty rating), decided to surprise his class (which last year had 50 and has suddenly mushroomed to 500) by doubling the requirements and adding five pages to the reading list. This is bad. Some old timers have taught guts far too long to be troubled by their reputations; they have something in common with upperclassmen who have long since stopped worrying about throwing away goodmoney learning the finer points of metal shop. Good guts include Human Development, studio art courses, film courses and the like. Don't take science courses, and unless you plan to major in the field, do not take comprehensive surveys intended as a major requirement. If you want to avoid going to class, take large lectures (make sure there are no recitations) where no one notices your absence, or courses that meet once a week. Contemporary Civilization (all the Great Works of philosophy you can cram into a semester) and Literature Humanities (Great Novels) are unavoidable, along with Music and Art Humanities. If you're lucky, you'll get a good prof. If you're not, you'll get an ignoramus TA who probably knows less about the subject matter than you do. The concept behind these courses is good (they're meant to teach basic urbanity) but the scope is too ambitious; they usually turn into a game of intellectual catch-up ball, with teachers frantically trying to lead their students through a bewildering mass of readingmaterial which must be covered on standardized exams. You usually retain enough to enable you to hold your own at West Side cocktail parties, but if you want to get laid, forget it —FIT girls are not impressed by a knowledge of Aquinas or Kant. (You'll find out what FIT is soon enough). Finally, you should know a thing or two about the mysterious workings of Columbia's administration. The university resembles the AustroHungarian Empire in organization, and some pessimists have suggested it will suffer the same fate. The big problem in the past has been an almost complete lack of coordination among the parts or any evidence of centralized planning; so the administration, in its infinite wisdom, decided to divided the academic sphere among three administrators instead of one. So now a troika of academic officers, known as provosts, is in charge; two have been chosen, for the professional schools and for the arts and sciences. The third postition, in charge of the Health Sciences (medicine, dentistry, nursing) has yet to be filled; knowing the Byzantine politics of the medical community, it should be an interesting search. Under the provosts, andresponsible to them, are the various deans of the school, including the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law School, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, etc. Appended to the mass of 17 schools and divisions are the satellites, namely, Barnard College and Teachers College, which are affiliated but are separate corporate entities. The intellectual divisions, the departments and regional institutes, are small fiefdoms carved out by deans and chairmen and have little in common with real demarcations in scholarship. When you begin to truly understand the realities of Columbia life and you have lost, so to speak, your virginity in your sophomore year, you'll be ready to take a one-year leave of absence as scores of students have done. The best place to go is Reid Hall, Columbia's one-or two-semester French program in Paris, where you can learn the language, do away with your requirement, and become the quintessentially well-rounded Columbia man or woman. A leave of absence gives you the much-needed breath of fresh air; it's best to do nothing if you've been doing something at school, or to do something if you've been doing nothing. When you return, one of two states of mind will greet you; you'll have a completely new, fresh perspective and plunge into academic life once again with vigor, or you'll spend your first month with ruminations of ""Oh my God! What am I doing here again!"" Bon voyage.Grubs."

31,Art Humanities,Music professors gave Spec a bum rap,31 March 1982,"To the Editor; I just finished reading the response of the music department last week to Sebastian Gluck's criticisms (Spectator, March 24). As a junior in the College, I have gotten over my original anger and frustration at the Columbia bureaucracy, but the irresponsibility and insults emanating from the university officials continues to amaze me. Their letter does deserve a response, though, if only because it represents much of what is wrong with Columbia. Although I am not a musician, I have taken Music Humanities and do know a few things about thebureaucracy here. At the beginning of the department's response, we are told how several officials have been ""beseeching, imploring, and urging"" the university for years to change things. Of course, if you asked Michael Sovern he would be in favor of the changes too. So would the students. The housing office tells us how it would like to change things; so do people in the bursar's office, professors, and administrators. Everyone is in favor of improvements, yet nothing changes. The only conclusion I can reach is that no one is responsiblefor the way things are, and thus everyone is irresponsible. Not satisfied with its limp defense of the department, the authors resort to ad hominum attacks against Mr. Gluck. They insinuate that he is responsible for ""breaking"" the organ in St. Paul's chapel and thus having it placed off-limits to students. Later they state that Mr. Gluck is closedminded, with ""conventional tastes and prejudices that limit him."" Such attacks are cheap and more becoming to a third-rate demagogue than a university official. They should be taken back.Later, the authors attempt to defend the Music Humanities course. From my experience and those of my friends, it is hard to tell from the professor's remarks if they have ever been in a Music Hum class. ""The greatest emphasis in a class of this sort,"" they write, ""will be on music since, say, 1700."" I guess that explains who one class spent six weeks on Gregorian chants. Unlike the Art Humanities orientation, only a secondary attempt is made in Music Hum to expose non-music students to a wide variety of Western music and to provide a background that is useful to them. Instead, theory is emphasized, which is very difficult and of little use to those of us whose talents don't incline in this direction. Whatever great music a student is exposed to and learns about happens by accident; in the process of learning theory you hear pieces that you like. At least in Art Hum they don't try to make us painters, but try to make us able to enjoy art as a non-artist. It is almost a universal complaint at Columbia that while CC and Lit Hum are good and useful courses and Art Hum is a pleasant surprise, Music Hum is a disappointment. This course needs to be restructured, and quoting from self-written and self-congratulatory departmental reports does nothing to further this goal. Music Hum is out of focus. No, Columbia does not hate music. It just does little to encourage it. I am not shocked or surprised, just disappointed and disillusioned. David Krentel College '83"
32,Art Humanities,"Sectioning bribes given, students say",30 September 1982,"By JOEL BERGEmployees of the registrar's office asked at least four students earlier this month for money in exchange for placing them in special core curriculum sections or switching them into new ones, the students have charged. One of the students, a sophomore, said his Literature Humanities section was changed on the first day of classes after he paid a registrar's office worker five dollars. But associate registrar David Genero said that two reports of bribes had reached either him or the College deans and that he, College Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal and College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka ""investigated but were unable to be totally satisfied that the transactions were made inthat context."" And, the heads of the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization programs used the reports to renew calls for a new method of sectioning for the College's core courses. The sophomore, who did not wish to be identified, said that he needed to switch sections because of a scheduling conflict, but that the time slot he wanted was closed. He said the worker told him, at sectioning, ""If you do me a favor, I can do you a favor."" The student said he and the employee then bargained until they agreed upon a fee. In another case, in which a student identified to Genero two workers who asked for a three to five dollar bribe, no disciplinary action was taken against the employees because they were temporary and could not later be located, Genero said. Another sophomore said he missed his specified time to section, and when he went later he was told all Literature Humanities sections were closed. He said the registration worker told him, ""For a few bucks we could work something out."" The student said that instead of paying, he complained to an official, whom he would not name. He said that though there was an investigation, the official ""didn't get me into a section."" A third sophomore claimed he declined an offer by two employees to change his Literature Humanities section for six dollars. He said one of the workers said, ""We could get you in, but you're gonna have to pay 'cause we go through a lot of shit."" Most of the people who worked at sectioning were either students or community residents hired especially for registration during the first week of school, Genero said. James Mirollo, chairman of the Literature Humanities program,said that if the reports of bribes were true, ""it is further proof that we have to section another way."" The sectioning process for Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization and Music and Art Humanities is set up so students can only choose what time they will take the courses. There are several sections of each course taught during each time slot, and the actual section in which a student is placed is left to chance. Before the current system was set up, students would get to sectioning hours before the process started so they could get spots in classes with their favorite professors. The current system was introduced to give all students a chance at getting popular professors and to cut down on the linesstudents faced at sectioning. But Wallace Gray, a professor of English and comparative literature and one of the more popular Literature Humanities professors, said students have noticed he has taught at the same time in the same room for seven years and are able to beat the system and get into his class. Peter Pouncey, chairman of the Contemporary Civilization program, said he heard rumors circulating about bribes and that professors joked about the low monetary value of their sections. He added that the current sectioning system was unacceptable and that computers should be used to ease sectioning and give students some choice of professors. Lehecka said he had heard onestory about bribery and added, ""if it happened once or twice it will poison the whole system."" Mirollo, Pouncey and Lehecka said College officials will be meeting next week to discuss possible changes in sectioning. The committee will look into sectioning by mail and computer, among other things, they said. They added that there is disagreement as to how much information students should have about professors in advance."
33,Art Humanities,CC asks SEAS to drop its core requirements,4 October 1982,"By RICHARD FROEHLICHThe College has asked the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to reexamine its requirement that students take some of the the College core courses and consider instead having a general nontechnical requirement. College officials said that if the SEAS policy were not changed it would force an increase in the number of Literature Humanities sections, but they warned that the program was already nearly so large as to be unmanageable. James Mirollo, chairman of the Lit Hum program, said if plans to increase the College class size go through, the situation would get worse. There are already 50 Lit Hum sections, he said. Moreover, Michael Rosenthal, college associate dean, said he is not sure ""whetherit makes sense"" for SEAS students to be required to only take part of the core curriculum instead of any particular, ""successful non-technical"" course. Engineers must now take either Lit Hum or CC and either Music Humanities or Art Humanities, but Rosenthal said he asked the SEAS to reconsider its policy—which is three years old. Ralph Schwarz, vice dean of the SEAS, said that the school would reconsider its policy in response to the College request but that he could not promise when it would be brought up because it was reviewed so recently. He added that he understood the concern over the problems in staffing Lit Hum sections but that any SEAS decision would not be based on ""that kind of problem."" Schwarz said when the school ""recentlyreexamined"" the program requirements of freshmen and sophomores, it ""reaffirmed that the best courses were Lit Hum and CC."" He added that the requirement was changed three years ago to make sure students take a full year of CC or Lit Hum. Previously students had to take any two semesters of the six semester core curriculum series, according to Fred Post, chairman of the Engineering Student Council. That change in SEAS policy has caused particular problems with Lit Hum because a surprisingly high percentage of engineers take it instead of CC and put ""pressure on the number of sections and section size,"" according to Mirollo. Post said he did not ""see the rationale for making the core classes requirements forCollege students and not engineers."" Rosenthal answered that claim by saying the core was designed to be taken as a whole group of four classes and that the core is meant to help give direction to College students in choosing a major. But Post countered that it was ""more essential for engineers—to help them find out what they want to do""—whether to stay in the SEAS or to transfer to a liberal arts program. That, he said, is ""a more critical decision than what major"" SEAS students will pursue. Mirollo said there was validity in the argument that the core should not be taken separately. ""They are taking a piece of what is conceived as a package. But the piece does not have the total effect of the package,"" he explained.James Parker, SEAS dean of students, said that when the decision was made three years ago to expand the requirements, there was not a ""concern of taking part of the core curriculum and not the whole."" Mirollo added he ""would hate to see someone not have to take it"" but at this point he was more persuaded by the practical aspect of the pressure on the sections."
34,Art Humanities,Some suggestions for Lit Hum,21 October 1982,"To the editor: Every year the Literature Humanities staff debates vehemently over the required reading list, with some professors advocating this or that book, according to their own personal tastes. The required texts remain essentially the same each year—lliad, Aeneid, Republic, Gargantua and Pantagruel, Gulliver's Travels—but there are usually some minor changes. I have a strong recommendation when the staff will discuss the reading list for 1983: Why not include Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye? With the College going coeducational and supposedly making adequate preparations for the transi-tion, it is absurd that among the twenty-five books forming the syllabus, not one of them was written by a female author. Are we to believe that female writers are incapable of producing great works of literature? The achievements of George Eliot and Jane Austen, I think, contradict this silly notion. How about including Pride and Prejudice to the required reading (or, at least, making it an available option)? This novel contains marvelous use of satire, irony, and narration; not to mention some basic themes emphasized in Literature Humanities—knowledge through suffering, deception of first impressions, love conquers all, human flaw of excessive pride... Jane Austen's novel is unques-tionably a ""classic,"" presenting a woman's viewpoint of English society, where we have inherited so much of our cultural richness. More important, the course has been severely criticized for its Western bias, and we should not allow it to be vulnerable to the attacks of male chauvinism. My second suggestion is to add Catcher in the Rye to the reading list. There will, of course, be formidable opposition. Some critics would hardly consider it a ""classic."" In its defense, I would like to point out that it is perhaps the most popular American novel since World War 11, especially among college students, and that it has received enormous critical praise. Others will condemn Sal-inger's book on account of its vulgar language. Is it, however, any worse than Rabelais's vivid description of human sexual and excretory functions? I think not. Literature Humanities should encourage discussions. Too often though, many students are overwhelmed with the instructor's knowledge of the books that they are intimidated to express their opinions. With Catcher in the Rye, however, the instructor may learn more from the students than the students from the instructor, since the protagonist is a young but precocious adolescent, who criticizes the hypocrisy of modern American society. Imagine the interesting and lively class discussions with this novel! In his inaugural address President Michael Sovern said: ""But it is on her common journey with modern man that Columbia finds her greatest reason for being."" In Art Humanities we study modern art, and in Music Humanities we listen to recent 20th century music, but in Literature Humanities westop somewhere in the 1860's. Literature Humanities should include a late 20th century work such as Catcher in the Rye because students should also learn to appreciate present literature. Since the course is presented in a chronological order, Salinger's novel must be the last reading, which many students will not bother to read because they are inundated with term papers and busy studying for finals. Catcher in the Rye, enjoyable and easily readable, will encourage more students to read the final book and to attend the last few discussions. Literature Humanities should make the students appreciate great works of literature, and the addition of Pride and Prejudice and Catcher in the Rye will enhance the already excellent course. I hope that the Literature Humanities staff will seriously consider these texts when it plans to make the 1983 reading list.

35,Art Humanities,Profs defend core as 'timeless',2 December 1982,"By LISA FAILER""The texts speak of the things that are timeless,"" said Professor of English James Mirollo, chairman of the Literature Humanities department. ""Life, love, death and hate."" ""Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization civilized me,"" said Dean of the College Robert Pollack, a 1961 graduate of the College. But the College's four required core courses that deal with the allegedly ""timeless"" works of civilization—Contemporary Civilization and Literature, Music and Art Humanities—have been criticized for their failure to include either modern works or works by women in their curricula.Although the Music and Art Humanities courses do allow for some study of modern works, most Literature Humanities sections end at Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, written in the latter part of the 19th century. And Contemporary Civilization instructors are asked to teach only one ""modern"" (20th Century) text of their choice in addition to the required books, which generaly end with a work by Sigmund Freud. Thus students reading about 50 texts in the two courses may only read two books written after 1900—and no books by women. Complaints that the core is sexually biased because it lacks works by women have stepped up since the College's announcement that it would admit womennext year. Women authors of high caliber, from Sappho to Jane Austen to many writers of this century, merit a place in the core curriculum, protestors claim. But College administrators and instructors in all courses said the core could never be temporally or sexually biased, because its traditional works are ""timeless"": its curricula have the capacity to respond to contemporary issues as they arise. The texts, they contend, present strands of thought that surface in everything else we read, thus serving as documents of this historical and continuing development of our culture. Others maintain that if the core ad-dresses ""all students' needs"" it becomes a survey course imbued with ""automatic superficiality."" Students can gain access to more contemporary works and works by women in other courses, faculty members said. Mechanical problems such as a lack of time for faculty to consider curricular additions and the difficulty of reaching staff consensus about which modern or womenauthored works to include also inhibit changes in the core, instructors and administrators said. Rather than representing all aspects of cultural history by including specific texts, the core should teach a ""common frame of reference and language"" that ""provides bridges of a sort between people that are intrinsically more valuable than those that are built by everyone watching baseball,"" said Deborah Goldberg, assistant professor of philosophy and a Contemporary Civilization instructor. Faculty members said the core provided students with this common ""vocabulary"" because the issues the courses raised could bedirectly related to contemporary developments—and to the changing student himself. ""The core curriculum is like the American Constitution,"" said Assistant Professor of English Peter Rudnytsky, a Literature Humanities teacher. ""Its permanence is assured by its capacity to accept gradual change."" ""We try to relate works to contemporary concerns,"" said Goldberg. ""From 1968-72 it looked like Thuycidides was teaching what happened on the Columbia College campus yesterday,"" said Professor of English Wallace Gray, a Literature Humanities instructor. ""It was like reading Spectator."" Although Music Humanities, Art Humanities and Contemporary Civilization do incorporate analyses of some modern works or ""leave room"" for them at the end of the syllabus, instructors of those courses agreed that deciding which works to include was extremely difficult. ""You're not going to have agreement among a staff of 46 as to what is a canonical text of today,"" saidPeter Pouncey, professor of classics and chairman of the Contemporary Civilization department. ""After 1933, I don't see any pattern of what should be taught,"" said Laurence Dickey, assistant professor of history and a Contemporary Civilization instructor. ""It's too early to tell what's fad and trendy."" Likewise, Literature Humanities does not deal with any works written after the 19th century. Gray said the course's syllabus had remained ""about 95 percent the same"" since he began teaching the course in 1953. Gray, who has gained campuswide popularity through his modern literature course, ""Eliot, Joyce and Pound,"" said he thought the addition of modern texts to the syllabus was not necessary. ""As long as you continue to relate the text to the students, the course will always be fluid,"" he said. ""It's not a frozen chorus."" Mirollo agreed. ""Aristotle lays out all the fundamental moral problems,"" he said. ""He answers questions from, 'Should I jumpover the turnstile without putting in a token?' to 'What is the good life?' "" Life in the College classroom will change next fall—and the anticipated presence of women has prompted discussion of alternative approaches to conducting the course. Most of these discussions center on new teaching techniques, rather than the addition of new works to accomodate women. Because women and therefore their creative attempts have been ""buried"" by a ""history which is a history of men,"" they could not author the type of ""masterwork"" that belongs on a core syllabus, said Goldberg. ""I don't think it's honest to make women appear more important in whatever kind of development than they are,"" said one Music Humanities instructor. ""I don't see why anyone should be embarrassed about that. It has to do with the accessability they had to training and the lives they lived."" ""Their talent was supposed to be limited to the domestic scene,"" said Professor of Music JoelNewman, chairman of Music Humanities. Although men and women faculty members agree that the College should not add a ""token"" work by a woman to the core, they disagree about whether an embellished ""feminist perspective"" should be consciously integrated into class discussions as an alternative. The calls for such a change reflect that something ""central"" has been ""left out"" previously ""simply because no one has been insisting that you teach it,"" Goldberg said. ""What a man needs to know and what a woman needs to know aren't different,"" she noted. But Howard McP. Davis, professor of Art History and an Art Humanities instructor since 1955, said that he did not believe he would have to alter his approach when women arrive because ""I already discuss the presentation of women in art."" ""Having more women in (Art) Humanities will only change the tone of the classroom,"" Davis said. Susan Tholl, a preceptor of art history teaching another Art Humanities section, agreed. ""The course will change of its own nature,"" she said. Faculty members said the purpose of Literature Humanities was to educate the ""whole"" individual regardless of the student's sex—by making the monuments touchable; by emphasizing that great works were created by real people ""and therefore were not perfect. ""I constantly encourage students to criticize the text,"" said Gray, ""by asking them 'Why don't you object to the work? Why can't you find what's wrong with the work?'"" ""There will remain and must remain * a variety of individual perspectives brought to bear on the works we read,"" said Rudnytsky. ""Literature Humanities is one course and 50 courses because each instructor will touch works in a different way."" But Professor of English Matthew Wikander, a Literature Humanities instructor, also emphasized the social role of the course. Students not only devleop, their perceptions of themselves and their world but receive a sense of ""shared"" experience with others who have and will take the course, he noted. ""Alumni sing the praises of Humanities,"" Wikander said. ""The core curriculum creates a solidarity—its a shared ordeal. It gives students a sense of the past—they now see that the chaos, confusion and weirdness that they are seeing around them has held a basic continuity through the ages. ""They're trying to engage the same issues—what is life and whether it has meaning.""SPECTATOR/ED KEATING Robert Pollack . . . civilize me"
36,Art Humanities,"$20M in rehabs planned Profs fear shortage of funds for Pupin, others",16 February 1983,"Profs fear shortage of funds for Pupin, othersBy JULIUS GENACHOWSKIColumbia architects have drawn up plans for nearly $20 million in renovations of Pupin, Schermerhorn, and the Butler Rare Books Library, but faculty members said they fear the university will not raise enough money for the projects. Officials said the renovations are desperately needed to upgrade the physics and art history departments' facilities to the levels of competing institutions. In light of the university's difficulties in soliciting capital campaign funds for construction, however, faculty members said the plans, which . are in preliminary stages, could be stopped dead in their tracks. However, Michael Neiditch, director of public affairs for the development office, said yesterday that he was pleased with the funds the university had raised for Schermerhorn and the rare books library. Another development office official, who asked not to be identified, said the development office was in the middle of soliciting some large gifts for Pupin. Neither of the officials would say how much money had so far been given for these projects. William Scott, associate budget director, added that unless the university raises a substantial portion of each project's cost, the capital budget committee, a group of senior adminstrators charged with reviewing construction projects, would not give the green light to begin building. ""If they have the gifts, we will give the go-ahead,"" Scott said. He suggested that some of the projects could be done in phases to relieve some of the cost pressures. Robert Novick, chairman of the physics depart""ment, said yesterday that considering the university's failure to raise enough money to proceed with its original plans for a $25 million chemistry building, he doubted whether Columbia could raise the $10.8 million necesary for the Pupin renovation. ""I'm not optimistic,"" he said, ""but if the university wants the physics department, it better find the money."" Novick explained that the building was far inferior to physics facilities at other schools and its poor condition was preventing the department from attempting up-to-date research. ""It's like an old, run-down tenement in the South Bronx,"" he said of Pupin.Novick added that he was having trouble attracting new faculty to the current physics site and that faculty members have already left the department because of the run-down facilities. William Wing, professor of physics at the University of Arizona, has recently accepted an offer to join Columbia's staff, but only after the university agreed to spend $500,000 refurbishing half of one of Pupin's floors, Novick said. President Sovern said recently that he was concerned with the slow rate at which ""bricks and mortar"" funds were coming in. Since the start of the capital campaign, university officials have stressed the difficulty of raising money for renovation and construction. Last week officials said they were forced to scale down plans for a new chemistry building from $25 million to $15 million. In addition, officials said thatthe university has only raised about $1 million of the nearly completed $5.6 million computer science building. Robert Broberg, vice president for facilities, said whether Pupin, Schermerhorn, or Butler are renovated depends entirely on the amount of money raised for the projects. ""It's a matter of how successful we are with the development effort,"" he said. Scott explained that if the university could not raise the funds, it would be forced to borrow money to cover the rest of the renovation costs. But interest rates are high, and Scott said, ""We generally don't borrow for that kind of thing."" Alfred Frazer, professor of Art History and Archeology, expressed dissatisfaction with his department's headquarters, Schermerhorn, similar to that of Novick. ""We are in a desperate situation compared to the quarters occupied by other institutions,"" he said. Frazer added that he was concerned but hopeful that the $5.6 million planned for the Schermerhorn renovation would be raised. Kenneth Lohf, librarian for the rare book division of Butler, would not comment on the plans for the library, saying only that an announcement would be made in March. But Stephen Lennard, director of university planning and project management, said that preliminary drawings call for $2.8 million to add office space, a reading room and an exhibition area above the 600 level in Butler Library. Plans for Pupin include modernized and expanded researchfacilities, a larger library, new office space and the renovation of the building's power and waterfiltering systems, according to Novick. Schermerhorn will be reoutfitted to provide an enlarged slide and photograph library, new offices, a lounge and an exhibition space designed to support the art humanities program, Frazer said—if the university raises the money for the renovations.Robert Novick . . .""run-down tenement"""
37,Art Humanities,Why they transfered to Columbia from Barnard,12 September 1983,"By SHARON WAXMANThe first students to transfer from Barnard to the College said they switched schools because they felt they belonged at the College in the first place, not because they were dissatisfied with Barnard. Of eight Barnard to College transfers, five were interviewed by Spectator this week. All five agreed that it was benefits at the College that caused them to transfer, not negative aspects of Barnard. ""I don't feel Barnard is inferior as an education, I just feel Columbia fits my wants more,"" said sophomore transfer Laura Porter. ""I was planning on Columbia when I first applied—l went to Barnard because it was with Columbia,"" she commented adding that she was disappointed when she found out the College was going to be coed the year after she would enter college. ""I felt Columbia's academic environment better suited my needs,"" said junior transfer Laura Glick. ""I liked the core curriculum, and I've taken lots of courses at Columbia,"" she said.Leslie Dreyfous, a junior transfer who is from California, said she had never heard of Barnard in high school. She sent her application to Columbia and they had to send it across the street. ""I sort of fell into Barnard,"" she said, ""When the chance arose to be at Columbia, which is where I originally wanted to be, I transferred."" ""It's more a thing of the spirit—my heart was at Columbia from the start,"" she added, ""It was not a rational decision."" Porter also said her decision to transfer was more a feeling than anything else. ""I don't have a wonderful answer when people ask why I transferred,"" she admitted, ""I really, really wanted to go to Columbia, but I can't really explain why."" Porter's father and brother are graduates of the College, and she said she wanted to share their alma mater and she also said she wants to go on the Oxford exchange pro-""It's more a thing of spirit — mv heart was at Columbia""gram, which is only possible through the College. But Porter added that she was content at Barnard, and would not have transferred to any other school but the College. ""I wasn't dying to leave Barnard,"" said sophomore transfer Melissa Mcßaney, ""I only applied to transfer because I thought it would be better for me."" Another transfer, however, was unsatisfied with the education she was getting at Barnard. ""When I applied to Barnard I thought that it was more integrated than it actually was,"" said sophomore transfer Jennifer Hochberg. ""They treat you differently at Barnard—they coddle you in a way."" Like many of the other transfers, Hochberg said she was sorrv that the Col-lege did not go coed her freshman year. She planned to transfer from the time she enrolled at Barnard and took Art Humanities and Literature Humanities last year in anticipation of the transfer. Hochberg said she was glad she had the experience at Barnard for a year, so she could get to know the university. ""At the College,"" she observed, ""things are much more bureaucratic and much more impersonal."" ""I liked Barnard, but I always wanted to go to Columbia,"" she added. Mcßaney said she disliked the tension she felt between Barnard and College students. ""There was a definite distinction between the fact that the girls are at Barnard and the boys are at Columbia,"" she said. ""There was a kind of ten-sion—almost a competitiveness."" And, she added, ""I like the attitude at Columbia better. The allwomen stuff is great, but I'd rather be in an atmosphere that's coeducational."" The students concurred that thier friends at Barnard ftaveßeen very receptive about the transfer—at least outwardly. ""To tell the truth,"" said Glick, ""it's an issue that isn't discussed all that much, and I'd rather not discuss it,"" but added that her friends have seemed unaffected by the news. Noted Mcßaney, ""All of myfriends have been perfectly receptive. I haven't encountered any hostility at all."" ""I was really nervous about it,"" said Porter, ""but my friends were really supportive. I didn't like to talk about it too much,"" she added. ""My friends asked me why (I transferred),"" said Hochberg, ""They respect my opinion. My friends are still exactly the same people."" Other transfer students are Rachel Turner, Kate Hunter, and a student who is taking a semester off, whose name the admissions office would not release.SPECTATOR/GABRIEL KUPERMINC Laura Glick"
38,Art Humanities,Wallach gives $3.5 M for new art gallery Will fund rehab and art hum tv show,29 September 1983,"Will fund rehab and art hum tv showBy JULIUS GENACHOWSKILong-time university financial supporters Miriam and Ira Wallach have pledged to Columbia a $3.5 million gift for a fine arts center that will help kick off Columbia's first formal art gallery, officials announced yesterday. The Art History and Archeology departments will also use the money to start an academic art journal and aid planning for a public television series based on the College's art humanities program. The Wallach gift, which will contribute to the $5.8 million overhaul of Schermerhorn hall, carries Columbia's five-year $400 million capital campaign over the $150 million mark. In addition, the gift is the first of its size for an Arts and Sciencer ""bricks and mortar"" project. University officials have ex-pressed concern over their inability to raise funds for renovation and new construction. Columbia has also received $7 million from Lawrence Wien for construction on Baker Field and $5 million from Temple Hoyne Buell to turn East Hall into an American architecture center. Ira Wallach, chairman of the board of Gottesman and Co. and the Central National Corporation, graduated from the College in 1929 and the Law School in 1931. Miriam Wallach is on the advisory council of Columbia's Department of Art History and Archaeology. Columbia's department ranked third in the nation behind New York University and Harvard in a recent study by the ConferenceBoard of Associated Research Councils. ""I think that without question, the gift will push us pu two notches."" said David Rosand, Chairman of the Art History and Archeology Department. Rosand added he hoped that the gift would set a precedent-for Columbia soliciting funds for arts. ""Columbia has been delinquint in its handling of the arts,"" Rosand said. ""I can only hope this puts the university on the right track."" The new Wallach Center will undertake joint projects with museums; invite distinguished visiting scholars to the university; .support student fellowships and museum internships; mount exhibitions; and create lecture, symposium and seminar series, according to a university press release. But the focus of the center will be Columbia's first formal public art gallery to be installed in Schermerhorn Hall. Rosand said he hopes to integrate the exhibitions into the curriculum by building seminars around the collections of works in the gallery. He added, thought, that he was not sure yet what works the gallery would exhibit. Wallach said yesterday of his wife's involvement with the department, ""I suppose that's where it all started."" Rosand recalled an advisory council meeting last year where he ""said we desperately need a student lounge and Miriam (Wallach) got interested.""""The whole question of humanities as a foundation of the College will finally be built in properly instead of this embarrassing exhibition of tacked-up photographs,"" Rosand said. A little over $1 million remains to be raised for the Schermerhorn rehabilitation, Rosand said, expressing confidence that Columbia will solicit that amount. Stephen Lennard, director of planning and project management, said the architects were about to draw up construction documents. Work is scheduled to begin next May and be completed by the fall of 1985, he said. The Wallachs have given millions of dollars to the university overr the past 15 years, including $2 million to renovate Livingston Hall and transform it into Wallach Hall. Columbia would not release dollar figures on the Wallachs' other donations, but it generally costs $1-1.5 million to endow a professorship like the Ira D. Wallach Chair in World Order Studies. Also, the Wallachs arranged for Columbia to acquire and install the Henry Moore sculpture titled ""Three Way Piece: Points,"" located near the School of International and Public Affairs. The center will also help create a journal of the History, Theory, and Criticism of Art, a biannual publication now being planned by department faculty.Art History faculty have already begun developing a 3-segment public television series which will follow the Art Humanities syllabus and would enhance the course through on-site camera work and television graphics. Rosand said he hopes a script will be ready this fall so that a proposal could be made to a public television station. Besides the center, the Schermerhorn renovation will provide for a second gallery dedicated to the Art Humanities program. The Humanities Studies Gallery, which Rosand said he hopes will be named after ""one of my soon-to-retire colleagues,"" will be designed to supplement the undergraduate art requirement.FLYING: Erica Jong, Barnard alumna, poet and author of Fear of Flying, captivated 350 people in Altshul last night as she read her work and discussed her life.

39,Art Humanities,CC students nabbed in library art theft,7 February 1984,"By ROSEMARY SICILIANOThe effectiveness of Art Humanities instruction showed its true colors early Sunday morning when two art-starved College students absconded with two portraits from Butler Library. An anonymous caller alerted Security guards after seeing the students enter the building from the scaffolding. According to Timothy Driscoll, associate director of security, security guards ""caught the students red-handed on the scaffolding"" with the stolen goods. The students, who have not been identified, have been referred to College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka, Driscoll added. Lehecka said that the two students will be seeing Associate Dean of Students Ben Lieber this week about the incident. Library officials ""had been concerned from the start"" about the security risk of the scaffolding, explained Director of Library Services Paula Kaufman. As a result, many of the windows had been nailed shut. ""I don't know how they managed to get in,"" she added. i"
40,Art Humanities,Brilliant named director of CC,5 March 1984,"By LESLIE DREYFOUSArt Humanities Department Chairman Robert Brilliant will become the first person to chair two of the College's core departments when he assumes the post of Contemporary Civilization chairman next September. Replacing the current head, Peter Pouncey, Brilliant said that he intends to ""form a closer association between the core department that will bring the core into a sharper focus."" ""I would like to see the kind of coherency that existed when the core was being developed during the 20's and 30's,"" commented Brilliant. ""The interrelationships of these courses are extremely important and being the first to direct two departments might be a help in strengthening them."" Brilliant, an historian in Ancient Greek art and an attorney, has been discussing the appointment since last December, when Pouncey first approached him. Although Brilliant has only taught one semester of CC, Pouncey notes, ""Brilliant knows the university and more importantly, he knows the senior professors."" ""Pouncey was looking for someone to take his place and follow in his footsteps,"" explained Brilliant. He also said that Pouncey was interested in finding someone ""who could get more senior faculty involved in theCG program."" Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the College, described, ""Brilliant is a powerful and persuasive* fellow who, I'm sure, will continue the success that Pouncey had in getting senior faculty."" He explained that often senior scholars avoid the core courses because the curriculum requires that they teach outside their field of expertise. ""It's a lot of work—you don't just throw the things together,"" said Rosenthal. ""There are no immediate payoffs and there is also a certain element of terror in facing twenty bright students."" Brilliant would not comment on prospective changes in the CC program, but again stressed that he will emphasize interdepartmental cooperation and exchange. ""This is one university and the core courses aren't the province of one or two departments,"" said Brilliant. ""Participation by more people from more departments is desirable."" Pouncey said that he was confident in Brilliant's administrative skill and pointed to his experience as a university senator as well as a member of the Society of Fellows, a program sponsored by the Mellon Foundation to provide young academics with employment for the first two yearsafter receiving their PhDs. ""Pouncey saw my enthusiasm and he has also seen me in a variety of roles,"" said Brilliant. ""I was familiar with not only the contents of a CC course (having taught the course the last semester), but also the activities related to the corecourses."" Rosenthal predicted that Brilliant's ""broad range of interests and administrative strength will be key in continuing the type of leadership Peter Pouncey started."" He continued, ""I think he'll bring energy, flare,and hard-nosedness."" Pouncey said he was satisfied with the dean's choice for his successor. ""It's a course well worth maintaining,"" stated Pouncey, ""and Brilliant's a man with the strength and energy to preserve and build on it."""
41,Art Humanities,BC Lit Hum applications plummet,19 September 1984,"By IRENE TUCKERNearly all Barnard students who registered for College core classes during last week's special sectioning period were able to be accomodated, though the total number of Barnard students who applied for admission to the courses was down significantly from past years, according to Columbia Registrar Zeita-Marion Lobley. Though the 45 students who enrolled in Contemporary Civilization represented only a slight decline from last year's figures, those seeking to enroll in Literature Humanities —until this year, the more popular of the two courses—fell by 44 students to 33. In a procedure designed to help assure that College andEngineering students, who must complete the core courses for graduation, received highest priority in the sectioning process, Barnard students were forced to wait until the automatic sectioning of those high-priority students was completed. This year, Bar lard students were not allowed to register until September 10, three days after classes began. Before the registration period began, some doubt remained as to how many spaces would actually be available to Barnard students. ""We hoped that this system would allow Barnard students to enroll but we weren't really certain,"" said Lobley. ""In the end, our gut feelings were right.""Michael Rosenthal, Associate Dean of the College, attributed the decline in Barnard students' interest in its core classes to several factors. ""I assume that in part the Barnard seminar program and perhaps the notion that the courses were not worth the trouble of going through the new sectioning procedures were responsible for the drop,"" he said. This year Barnard instituted a new freshman seminar program that in part parallels the Lit Hum curriculum. The only course from which Barnard students were turned away was Art Humanities. Students from all three undergraduate divisions were closed out of the course. ""We were completely surprised by the popularity of Art Hum,"" Lobley said. Both Lobley and Rosenthal said they hoped the sectioning procedure could be modified in the future so that Barnard students would be able to complete their sectioning before the beginning of classes.HOW MUCH IS THAT DOGGIE?: What better place to be on a cool day than in a booth al the San Sennaro Festival"
42,Art Humanities,Hamilton protestors get light sentence,3 September 1985,"By IRENE TUCKERFifty four students who participated in last spring's blockade of Hamilton Hall were given one semester of disciplanary warning in a ruling handed down Friday by the Hearing Officer Lewis Kaden. The protestors were found to be in violation of the University rule that prohibits short-term interference with the use of University facilities. But Kaden did not find the students guilty of the more serious charge of substantially disrupting the University's function. The University had intitially charged the protestors with ten rules violations. John Mason Harding, general counsel disagreed with Kaden's view that the blockade did not substantially disrupt the University. But, he said, ""My reaction intiailly is that is [the ruling] is a good development for the institution for establishing since 1968 that there are minimal rules that have to be obeyed."" According to Harding, the University might consider an appeal of the ruling. The decision to appeal must be made within 10 days of the initial ruling. Associate Professor of Law Gerard Lynch, a legal advisor to the respondents, said the decision was ""as close to a victory as you can expect in legal proceedings,"" although Kadenrejected the defendants' call for amnesty based on ""the justice of the cause."" In sentencing the students to one semester of disciplinary warning, Kaden also suggested that any note of the disciplinary violation be removed from students' transcripts that are sent to prospective employers or graduate schools. Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack said he was not certain whether members of the Columbia College administration would accept Kaden's non-binding request to have the disciplinary mark expunged from transcripts sent outside the University. According to Pollack, the students who opted for deans' discipline in Columbia College have already agreed to probation, a sentence which is more serious than disciplinary warning and is equivalent to censure within the University disciplinary system. If students placed on probation seek to abrogate the agreement in the face of the lighter sentence imposed by the Universitywide process, Pollack said he and Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka would reconsider the probation decision. The ruling marked the culmination of the in-ternal disciplinary process that began in May and continued throughout the early part of the summer. Although 61 students were initially charged with the rules violations, charges against seven of them were dismissed, in most cases for lack of evidence. Thirty-nine additional students charged with rules violations chose to be disciplined by the deans of their divisions. As many as 300 students blockaded Hamilton Hall last spring, calling on the University to divest its $39 million of holdings in South Africa-related companies. The protestors who were discipline were the ones that deans were able to identify. Respondent David Goldiner, a member of the steering committee of the Columbia Coalition for a free Southern Africa, recently called last week's recommendation of total divestment by the Columbia Board of Trustees Subcommittee on Investments ""a vindication of everything we did last spring."" I accept—indeed, I respect—both the students' passionate commitment to their cause and the dignity of the action they took to support it,"" Kaden said in his 46-page decision. ""I agree with the faculty members and public officials who hailed the students' acts of conscience, but with the reservation that nothing excuses the bolt they placed on the door."" The Rules of University Conduct were adopted in 1969 in response to the student protests of the previous years, and were revised in 1982. These hearings marked the first occasion that they have been applied. The students, most of whom were identified as participants in the action by deans who viewed videotapes taken of the blockade by University security, were initially charged with 10 rules violations, four serious and six simple offenses. The focus of the conflict centered around whether the blockade seriously disrupted the function of the University. The two sides differed on how the rule defining substantial disruption (Section 8, Rule 413) should be interpreted. The rules classify as a serious violation action that ""continues for more than a very short period of time to physically prevent, or clearly attempt to prevent, passage within, or unimpeded use of, a University facility, thus substantially disrupting a University function."" While University lawyers maintained that the length of the protest and its interference constituted substantial disruption of the University's operations, lawyers for the defendants held that the existence of substantial disruption had to be established. Kadan upheld the defense's interpretation of the clause. ""If preventing access to a University facility for an extended period of time were sufficient to constitute a violation of the rule, the 'disruption' in Section 8 would be superfluous,"" Kaden said. ""There is no reason to assume that the draftsmen of the Rules included a clause which added nothing to the meaningof the Rule,"" he concluded. Furthermore, Kaden ruled, the University counsel did not adequately prove that significant disruption had occurred. Because students could enter Hamilton Hall through a tunnel from the adjacent Kent Hall, anyone who wished to have access to Hamilton was not prevented by the demonstration, according to the ruling. Faculty members were able to hold classes in Hamilton throughout the demonstration without meaningful adverse effects and though the blockade placed additional burdens upon the members of the registrar and security offices, the University counsil did not prove that adverse effects that resulted were substantial, the ruling said. Kaden also agreed with the defense that the blockade at times enhanced education at Columbia. ""Professors in such diverse courses as Italian, Art, Humanities, Constitutional Law and Urban Planning devoted class time to discussion of issues raised by the national debate over the effectiveness of divestiture policies and economic sanctions against South Africa, he said."" ""The University community gained from the exchange of ideas generated by the demonstration: the students forced all of us to re-examine our beliefs about the South African system and the best means by which to oppose it."" Because proof of violations of the remaining charges was dependent upon sufficient proof of a violation of Section 8, Kaden dismissed the other eight charges on grounds of insufficient evidence, finding the blockaders guilty only of impeding short-term access to University facilities, as prohibited by Section 7 of Rule 413. Under a simple violation such as Section 7, violators can be sentenced to penalties ranging from a disciplinary warning imposed for one to three semesters, to censure, a disciplinary mark that remains on the offenders records for the remainder of their academic tenures and requires more strict measures for subsequent disciplinary violations. Kaden said that the particulars of the Hamilton blockade demanded leniency in sentencing. ""The circumstances of the offense and the offenders show that the students acted on the courage of their convictions. They conducted themselves in a dignified and orderly manner."" In addition, Kaden maintained that Section 7 was among the least damaging of the simple violations enumerated in the Rules of University Conduct. Tanaquil Jones, a member of the Coalition steering committee, said she was pleased by the outcome of the disciplinary procedure. ""I'm happy about the decision,"" Jones said. ""It's been a learning experience for me. I could have been wrong about the level of impartiality Kaden could maintain. ""Still, it's not going to change my political outlook about the function of the administration in a university,"" she continued. ""I don't fee Hike the administration is my friend now."""
43,Art Humanities,Revamping Art Hum curric,1 April 1986,"By RAQUEL ROBINSONSo you thought Art Hum. classes were destined to be dull and lifeless, filled with endless descriptions of the Parthenon and a cursory treatment of modern art? Well, it seems the era of using Art Hum. class to catch up on sleep and work on unfinished homework is over. The Art Humanities curriculum has been completely revamped, and its new focus will provide many happy and exciting hours. ""We hadn't been happy with the old curriculum fora long time,"" says Victorine Lewis, spokesperson for the Art Humanities Task Force Group. ""The course neglected a lot of important genres—students were completing Art Hum. and not really understanding the implications these oeuvres have had upon our society."" Yet just what is so exciting about the new curriculum? ""It's hard to pin down.. .it has a real je ne sais quoi about it,'' said Lewis as he munched a croissant. In more practical terms, the new Art Hum. is divided into five different sections, each focusing on an important area of art that the Task Force Group feels Art Hum. has overlooked Until now. The five topics have not been completely set yet, but Lewis disclosed that ""We're pretty sure one will be subway graffiti art, and we're really pushing for plastics, with a particular emphasis on Tupperware. Tupperware just has a certain ambiance about it...it's hard to define...a real, you know, soup du jour quality."" The new curriculum will also include field trips and guest lecturers. For the graffiti section, much class time will be spent riding the IRT -1 train, although there has been worry aboutthe lack of art work available since the advent of the shiny new ungraffitied -1 trains. Emergency measures may be made to ride the Bth Avenue line or the GG line in Brooklyn which, says Lewis, ""We hear from art dealers and gallery owners is really hot."" The Task Force Group also hopes graffiti artists will speak to classes. ""We were trying to get Denise 165, but that fell through, so we may have to settle for Bobby 236."" The plastics section also promises to be an eye opening experience. The Task Force has contacted the main Tupperware outlets to arrange for visits from Tupperware representatives, and possibly even a Tupperware party. Says Jerry Atrik, cochair of the Task Force, ""We'll ask students to bring in any vintage Tupperware art their parents may have around the house—you'd be surprised how much of this is still preserved in peoples' homes."" The Task Force has high hopes for introducing students to the artistic values and meaning inherent in Tupperware. ""A lot of this art has a very earthy, organic element to it,""says Atrik. ""And the masturbatory Oedipal symbols are just rampant, especially in the yellow-orange bowl and platter Expressionist phase."" The old curriculum will not be completely dropped, however. It will be retained to point out connections and influences between it and the new curriculum—for example, a special introductory section on the links between the Parthenon and the new refrigerator art is in the works. And when will this fascinating new system be in effect? ""As soon as we can convince President Sovern to finance subway fares for all the Art Hum. students."""
44,Art Humanities,Letters Brilliant defense,17 November 1986,"Brilliant defenseTo the Editor: You have at last pushed your policy of ""adversarial"" reporting over the boundary of decency. Spectator's most recent article concerning the Chamberlain issue included a series of gratuitous defamations of Professor Richard Brilliant. I protest in the strongest possible terms. I ask that you allow your readers to consider the following facts. None were mentioned in your article. When Professor Brilliant agreed three years ago, at our request, to take on the chairmanship of Contemporary Civilization fora threeyear term, we were delighted. To find a tenured art historian willing to direct CC was in itself indication of Professor Brilliant's commitment to undergraduate education in general and the core curriculum in particular. It is a commitment from which he has never wavered. That he came with the experience of having successfully led the Art Humanities program made him unquestionably the most experienced chairman in the core curriculum program in many years. He did indeed insist that preceptors attend the mandatory luncheon meetings, that they not cancel their classes or leave before the end of the term, and that they try to honor the discussion basis of the course. These are precisely the ""legalisms"" that keep the course a coherent enterprise. Those who find such notions onerous probably shouldn't be teaching in a serious college. He has fired nobody. His desire to find out what is going on in the classroom, particularly with new preceptors, by sitting in on classes is not something for which a conscientious course director need apologize. I find it hard to take seriously Professor Larmore's objection that the preceptorsare hurt by such a practice. In short, I know of few people who care more deeply about the education of College students and the health of the core curriculum than Professor Brilliant does. I think it lamentable that Spectator apparently feels itself free to write the sort of story it did. As Dean of the College, I am very disappointed. Robert E. Pollack Dean, Columbia College Editor's Note: Dean Pollack was contacted before the article was written and asked to comment on Professor Brilliant's departure and on his tenure as head of the CCprogram. Pollack refused to comment except to say that Brilliant and hir predecessor had done ' 'fine jobs."
45,Art Humanities,"Major minority problems CBSC on racism: No action, no peace",14 October 1987,"CBSC on racism: No action, no peaceBy Dineo Khabele, JacQuie Parmlee, and Dorian ScottRacism and the threat of racial violence still exist at Columbia, despite the efforts of Concerned Black Students at Columbia. CBSC has assumed a role of educating the community, supporting the victims of racial attacks, and reiterating solutions to Columbia's racist policies—solutions first set forth more than 20 years ago by students of color. Columbia administrators haven't lived up to their responsibility to make Columbia a safe and enriching environment for minority students. Columbia has, throughout its history, displaced many black and Hispanic families from the Harlem Heights area in its quest to unite the uptown campus with the ""Morningside Heights"" campus. Columbia's minority population has chronically lagged behind the percentage of minorities nationwide. At the same time, the few who do attend Columbia find minimal support services; minority students do not receive academic, emotional, or financial counseling specific to their needs. Columbia's core curriculum also ignores the history and needs of minorities. The core isn't merely biased in its Eurocentric content—some of the subject matter is overtly racist. For example, in an Art Humanities class, African art is sometimes contrasted to Greek art; it is often described as primitive as opposed to classical. And students at Columbia rarely learn that Greek civilization was predominately influenced by African civilization. Racist policies like these, embedded in Columbia tradition, help foster the climate that hascaused past and present racial outbursts on campus. Because black students are painfully aware of Columbia's history, they are not surprised at the administration's lack of support and action to prevent and punish racist incidents. As a result, Don Chiesa, Mike Bogacki, Matt Sodl, and Drew Krause—not to mention other perpetrators of the March 22 attack who are yet to be identified—are still on our campus. Dylan Russo and Michael Terriend, who drew and posted a White Power/Klu Klux Klan sign in a dorm last semester, are also walking freely on campus, although the incident was reported to the deans' office. Meanwhile, other racist incidents continue to occur. During orientation, a black student approached some white students and asked where a water fountain was. A white studentreplied: ""You either have to be this big or this color to get anything around here."" About three weeks ago, a black woman in an elevator with several white males overheard them talking about looking fora party. They concluded that since they couldn't find a party, they would go beat up some niggers. And last month, the Fiji fraternity designed a party poster that mocked a CBSC flyer distributed after the March 22 racial attack. The ""Concerned Fiji Students at Columbia"" poster was distributed across campus and blatantly posted on the Malcolm X lounge door. These incidents clearly illustrate that the threat of racial violence is present and mounting. Since the March 22 racial incident, the administration has paid only lip service to minority needs. After 25 years in committee—and several days after March 22—the University proudly announced that the African-American Studies program had been approved. But students who want to major in African-American Studies will find that faculty, course content, research facilities, and funds have been only minimally provided for. The plans the University has announced for the $25 million Kluge donation (a donation announced April 30, nine days after the April 21 blockade) do not address the widespread problems of student and faculty recruitment and retention. The proposal to partially forgive loans of students who earn doctorates is based on the premise that there will be a pool of undergraduate students able to go on to graduate school. But the high rate of attrition at Columbia tells us that our minority undergraduate population is steadily dwindling. In the past two years, at least 11 h>ackundergraduates could not return to Columbia for financial reasons. Other efforts made by the University, including workshops on ""multiculturalism,"" a lecture series, and forums, are not tangible solutions to the problems of institutional racism. They barely scratch the surface. It is imperative for the University to take responsibility for making fundamental changes in policy. Columbia can start taking concrete action by implementing the 13 demands submitted last spring by concerned black students. These same demands have been articulated by minority students for more than 20 years. Columbia must realize that it needs an administrative office dealing specifically with the concerns of students of color. Most other universities have created an office of minority affairs headed by a minority dean. Columbia desperately needs an office that fulfills this role. Furthermore, Columbia could begin revising the University rules of conduct. Currently the rules apply only to pickets, rallies, and demonstrations. We wonder why the original drafters of the rules (after the protest oncampus) sought to punish only activism that challenges the University. Why don't the rules address issues like racist behavior that should not be permissible or condoned in an educational setting?As concerned black students at Columbia, we recognize the urgent need for change here. We are determined to push for an independent investigation of the March 22 racial attack. We expect the University to live up to its rhetoricas a university that does not tolerate racism. We will continue to support those victims of racial attacks and we will continue to educate the Columbia community about racism. No justice, no peace.Dorian Scott, CC '89, Dineo Khabele, CC '89, and JacQuie Parmlee, CC '89, are steering committee members of the Concerned Black Students at Columbia."
46,Art Humanities,"Core, Schmore",1 September 1988,"By Jonathan EarleSo you thought Columbia College's core curriculum was a complete bastion of stability? Well, sorry— everything, even the core, has to come up lor review sometime. A committee of protessors comissioned by Dean Robert Pollack to evaluate and recommend changes for the core has been meeting since March to revamp a curriculum some have criticized as euro centric. The core curriculum, the set of common courses each Columbia College student must complete for graduation, has its roots in the required Contemporary Civilization (CC) course created in 1919. Today, in addition to one year of CC, the core includes a full year of Literature Humanities (Lit-Hum), a semester each of Music and Art Humanities, English 1007, two semesters of Physical Education, two semesters of science, and four semesters or the equivalent of a foreign language. While the core commission, chaired by John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary, has yet to make any formal recommendations, one aspect of the new and improved core is already in effect: the new ""major cultures"" requirement. The requirement, approved by the faculty last February, calls for all Columbia College students to complete six points of courses dealing with ' 'other major cultures not covered under the present core,'' according to History Professor Anslie Embree, who chaired the committee which selected courses to fulfill the new requirement. The major cultures requirement, which replaces theunfocused and unpopular ""remoteness"" requirement, will affect all members of the class of 1992, as well as current juniors and sophomores, Embree said. He added that certain courses dealing with issues of gender and race, as well as those covering Latin America, will satisfy the requirement. The outgoing remoteness requirement vaguely called for six points of courses to be taken outside the student's area of major or concentration. As with its predecessor, students must take courses outside their major fields to satisfy the new cultures requirement. Lists of the courses which satisfy the major cultures requirement are available in the Registrar's office and the Dean of Students office. However, Embree pointed out that the major cultures requirement is an ""interim requirement,"" for use while the deßary commission is debating the larger restructuring of the core curriculum. ""This is not a definitely permanent thing—but I do expect it to be enforced at least this year and next,"" Embree said. While the major cultures requirement is the first visible change in the core in quite a while, Pollack said last spring that it is just one part of the total review of the curriculum. He said then that it was ""time to review the curriculum we all take for granted. The last time it was looked at was more than a decade ago."" Pollack also said the current evaluation would be more ""comprehensive"" than previous at-tempts. This time the commission will look at the overall curriculum, instead of concentrating only on what specific courses and works the core should contain, Pollack said. Last spring deßary, who was a first year Columbia student in 1937, the year Lit Hum was made a required course, scheduled a series of opei- ( hearings to discuss and evaluate different aspects of the curriculum. Columbia's core has come under fire in recent years for dealing too exclusively with the works and thinking of white, European males. Works by minorities and women have been added to the syllabi of many core courses, but these additions are often viewed as ""token."" While deßary has said he expects some changes to come out of his commission's evaluation, he said he cannot see Columbia doing away with the core entirely. ' 'In likelihood we will reaffirm the need and value of some core curriculum, and then add some new elements. I wouldn't be surprised if there were some changes,'' deßary said in February. ""If we didn't have something worth preserving, we wouldn't be putting all this effort into evaluating and hopefully improving it,""he said. Deßary originally said it woul take at least a year for the commis sion to come up with its recommendations, so hearings will most likely continue through the fall semester. That means all of you still get to read Aristotle and Augustine. Happy reading.AH, HAMILTON: All hope abandon ye who enter here"
47,Art Humanities,Retired profs will teach core through new Heyman project,16 September 1988,"By Penny BritellSo you thought you couldn't take that great history class because the professor is retiring? Wrong—thanks to the new Society of Senior Scholars, coordinated by the Heyman Center for the Humanities, retired professors will return to the cldssft)om to tfeach the corecurriculum. John Mitchell Mason Professor Win. Theodore deßary first conceived the idea for such a program in 1975, when he organized the Columbia Society of Fellows in the Humanities, a program for postdoctoral fellows teaching the core curriculum. ""At the time, I felt we should be doing something for senior scholars,"" deßary said. ""[The Society of Senior Scholars] is something that retires people in a regular way but at the same time keeps them busy."" The Society of Senior Scholars increases the number of faculty teaching the core curriculum, while at the same time freeing positions to allow younger professors to advance, deßary said. ""The student population isn't shrinking, so instead of adding more post-graduate students to teach thecore [curriculum], we add senior staff—in a way that neither imbalances the staff nor thwarts the advancement of younger faculty,"" he explained. The Society was established at the Heyman Center with a $340,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The first members of the Society are MacDowell Professor Emeritus of Music Jack Beeson, Moore Collegiate Professor Emeritus of Art History Howard Davis, University Professor Emeritus Louis Henkin, former Director of the Pew Initiative in Diplomatic Training and Professor Emeritus of History Graham Irwin, Avalon Professor Emeritus in the Humanities Joseph Mazzeo, Professor of Oriental Studies John Meskill, former Professor of Music Joel Newman, Adlai Stevenson Professor Emeritus of International Relations Marshall Shulman, and Adjunct Professor of Japanese History Arthur Tiedemann. ""We're very fortunate that we have such a large number of distinguished faculty who are not only willing to join the program but who are extremely enthusiastic about it,"" deßary said. The Senior Scholars, who must be between the ages of 65 and 75, will each teach one course per semester and participate in the activities of the Society and the Humanities colloquia at the Heyman Center, according todeßary. ""Some [Senior Scholars] are already teaching—others have existing commitments, * such as Professors Shulman and Henkin. Others are being brought out of retirement, but eventually all of them will be teaching the core curriculum,"" deßary said. The Society of Senior Scholars will assist in the training of younger scholars, according to Vice President for Arts and Sciences Jonathan Cole. ""[The Society] is an extraordinarily exciting and interesting idea,"" Cole said. ""Ted deßary has put together a group of senior scholars with years of devotion to teaching in the core curriculum [who are] enormous additions to the faculty. We won't lose [the] treasure [of] their expertise,"" he added. Senior Scholar Graham Irwin voiced similar sentiments. ""I'm not immediately going to be teaching again—[but] I hope next year to be teaching Contemporary Civilization,"" Irwin said. Senior Scholar Howard Davis said he is pleased to return to teach humanities as a member of the Society. ""I think it's a good program—what it achieves is to bring experienced people back to teach after retirement. I loved the Art Humanities course, and I'm looking forward to teaching it again,"" Davis said.Wm. Theodore deßary"

49,Art Humanities,"Faculty, admins praise core curriculum report",27 January 1989,"By Evan Paul SchultzThe report released in December by the committee that reviewed Columbia College's core curriculum reaffirms the school's dedication to general education in both Western and non-Western areas, faculty and administrators said. The Commission on Core Curriculum, which was chaired by William Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, was created in February, 1988 by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack. The committee's report did not suggest major changes for Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), Music Humanities, or Art Humanities. But the committee did recommend reform in areas of non-Western and modern traditions, through the creation of an ""extended core"" which would examine ""major problems of contemporary civilization that are of global scope and significance."" These issues should be studied in the same manner as in current Lit Hum and CC courses, the report said. According to the report, the extended core should avoid focusing onparticular cultures or religions, and instead emphasize common themes and problems, to ""minimize any element of ethnic self-assertion, ideological special interest, or minority advocacy partaking of a politicized struggle that could turn the curriculum into a jungle of educational conflict and competition."" ""A core course should approx-imate a multi-cultural forum, rather than serve as a platform or pulpit for the promotion of a particular ideology or religion,"" the report reads. In addition, the committee proposed the establishment of a Standing Committee on Core Curriculum to report regulary to the Columbia College faculty on the state of the core. Assistant Professor of East Asian Studies Paul Anderer, a member of the committee, called the creation of the standing committee the ""heart and soul"" of the report. The core commission strongly advocated revamped staffing procedures in the core courses, including the reinstitution of the Chamberlain leave program for CC preceptors—a paid one-year leave of absence awarded upon the completion of three years of teaching—and granting special consideration to preceptors and assistant professors who apply for promotion or tenure in their departments. Pollack, who said he was ""indebted"" to the commission fora ""realistic,"" report, said that Columbia College could not independently implement all of the committee's recommendations. ""Recommendations made which cover issues of resources and academic priorities and department staffing patterns cannot be solvedin Columbia College. They must be confirmed by [the] arts and sciences [division of the University] as a whole,"" he said. Pollack said he will ask the Columbia College faculty by next month to change the bylaws of the faculty Standing Committee. I will do what I can to be sure whatever needs [the commission calls for] will be fulfilled respective to the college so we will be able to meet the challenges so clearly posed in the commission report,"" Pollack said. Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal, a member of the committee, said the commitee's report voices the general agreement of its members, but that he ""[doesn't] agree with everything. No one does with a consensus report."" The Standing Committee would deal with the actual restructuring of the core, Rosenthal added. Chair of the Contemporary Civilization department and Professor of History Ainslee Embree, who served on the core review committee, said the report could have placed more emphasis on non-Western cultures. ""I would have preferred to see [the report] more clearly focused on non-Western traditions. In the present suggested form it may be too distributional and similar to the old remoteness requirement,"" Embree said.Columbia College's remoteness requirement, under which students take six points in areas outside their major or courses related to their major, was replaced by the requirement that students take six points in courses dealing with major cultures ""not covered adequately by the core."" Embree said he felt the committee made valid pedalogical arguments for maintaining the Western emphasis. The report suggests that by limiting material to Western traditions in courses like Lit Hum and CC, students will undergo ""an examination of their own mental furniture,"" before moving on to the non-Western works to be covered in the extended core. Anderer, an assistant professor of East Asian Studies, said he would have preferred more non-Western texts integrated into Lit Hum and CC, but maintained that the report's value lay in reaffirming the faculty's interest in teaching general education core courses. ' 'What the committee tried to do was see if the faculty remained committed to teaching general education courses of any kind, either Western or non-Western,"" he said. The opportunity still exists to study nonWestern cultures in the ""second tier"" of the extended core, which would include a greater number of electives than the current core,Anderer said. Robert Belknap, Chair of the Lit Hum department and professor of Russian Language and Literature, said he thought the report left much for the standing committee to accomplish. ""The report specified certain things, while it decided to delegate others to the standing committee. The report is demanding some commitment from the entire University. The report itself won't do a thing,"" he said. Belknap said he approved of placing nonWestern cultures in the extended core. ""That's definitely where they belong. I'd hate to see amateurs like me trying to do justice to those things which are beyond our expertise. I can do a half-way decent job with Greek literature, but not for Indian,"" he said. Wallace Gray, professor of English and Comparitive Literature, who has taught Lit Hum since 1963 and has published a book on the texts read in the course, said he strongly agrees with committee's stress on Western traditions. ""I support the notion that in order to be an educated student you must read Western works which have influenced all cultures,"" he said. Gray said he favors the extended core over the addition of non-Western texts to the core curriculum, where reading one non-Western book would, he said, amount to tokenism.Robert Pollack"
50,Art Humanities,Comment Course inconsistency causes core curriculum catastrophe,1 February 1989,"Course inconsistency causes core curriculum catastropheAnother January, another stroll down the corridor of Philosophy Hall. We all know the feeling of frantically searching for the computer printouts of our classes. Cautiously we run our finger down the sheet until our social security number appears. There it is: your grade. I personally am fascinated by grades. In fact, I don't just look at my own grades, I look at every grade in every class. I start at Accounting and keep perusing until I finish with Yiddish.While it may seem bizarre and disturbed, this ritual is ultimately insightful. Having examined grades for three years, I have learned there is great variance in grading between different sections of Columbia College core curriculum classes. Grade distributions generally vary from department to department, and from class to class. Some departments or classes have mostly high grades, while others do not. Either all the smart people take the same classes, or some classes are easier than others. I incline toward the latter. For most subjects this does not jose a problem, as people who choose a particular course know what they're getting into. For some, difficulty of a class does not matter as long as the subject is interesting. For others— especially masochists and lazy students— difficulty of a class is of great importance in deciding whether or not to take it. Where students have freedom to pick aspecific class, it is of no real importance that some are easier than others. Unfortunately, the area in which this choice does not exist happens to be one that is integral to the Columbia undergraduate educational experience: the core curriculum. We are led to believe that the core curriculum is meant to unify Columbia College students by providing them with a commoneducational base. Ideally, once we all drink from this common spring, we then can then diversify—complementing a broad base with the major electives of choice. However, the base is uniform neither in content nor in workload. The only truly unifying aspect of the core curriculum is that most students bond together in opposition to it. The classes in the core—LiteratureHumanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art and Music Humanities, and English—do not appear to be standardized. Anyone who has taken these ""automated sectioning"" classes know that emphasis and workload vary significantly. There is a clear disparity between core intent and core content. Each instructor intends to teach the same subject, but this results in 25 distinct classes with different syllabi, requirements, and grading standards. Consider my Contemporary Civilization class. While students in other sections basked in the simplicity of their respective requirements, my class sat dazed as the instructor outlined the course, assigning paper after paper. At the end of the semester, the final tally came to ten papers—in addition to the midterm and final exams. He gave one A grade. It wasn't mine. It is not unreasonable to require this much work fora four-point course, but it is clearly unfair that instructors of other sections assign one-quarter as much work. To ice the cake of injustice, these easygoing educators even award higher grades. Of all the core courses, Literature Humanities is the only one which implements a standard finaTexam. While it is expected that instructors will always vary in grade leniency, regulating course requirements would at least help to equalize these allegedly ""core"" courses. As long as discrepancies exist between core sections, students should be allowed to make informed choices regarding which core classthey will enroll in. In Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization this is usually possible. Since the sectioning forms list the names of the instructors, students can find out who many of them are. Nevertheless, this is generally only true for the professors, while the graduate student teachers often remain a mystery. The real crime is the randomness of Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and English. Anyone who takes these classes learns that one's grade is largely determined by the computer in Philosophy Hall that places the student in a specific section. These classes are supposed to be the same from section to section, but they are not. The worst offenders are the English 1007 composition instructors. Though the workload is fairly consistent, the demands are completely inconsistent. Some of the instructors give out mostly Cs, while some give out mostly Bs or As. Unlike Art and Music Humanities, one generally cannot drop these classes even ifplaced in a lousy section. Sectioning for these requirements is more like playing Lotto than selecting a class. If section diversity is to be maintained, it is imperative that the University provide the same information about different core classes as they do about other courses. All this would require is a little more paperwork and computertime for the University. With so much fairness to be gained, this extra burden seems a small price to pay. The core curriculum exists because the school believes certain subjects are important enough to be required. Labeling these courses as ""core"" infers that everyone will learn essentially the same information. It should also mean that the same demands are expected of all students. If these courses are so important, they should be truly standardized so that everyone has an equal opportunity to learn and benefit from them. As of now, the core curriculum fails to meet this crucial standard.Jeff Rake is a Columbia College junior.Rake's progress Jeff Rake"
51,Art Humanities,CC faculty approves core committee,28 February 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzA new standing committee charged with reshaping and monitoring Columbia College's core curriculum was unanimously approved by the Columbia College faculty last week. The new standing committee will use the de Bary commission report on the core submitted in December as a blueprint for its work, according to standing committee chair Jacob Smit, professor of history. A committee to review the core curriculum, chaired by Theodore de Bary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, was established by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack last year. The commission's final report call-ed for an ""extended core"" to cover non-Western cultures and committment by the Columbia College and the University to the core. It also called for the establishment of the standing committee to review the core curriculum continuously. Smit said the report left considerable room for discussion. The committee's first responsibility will be to set up the structure of the ""extended core"" because of problems facing the current major cultures requirement. ""There are practical reasons to devote most of our energies to the extended core because the major cultures requirement has led to over-subscription of many courses,"" Smit said. The two-semester major cultures requirement was instituted last semester to ensure that students take courses dealing with non-Western cultures. Many teachers of thecourses reported problems of overcrowding last month. The major cultures requirement has the added problem of not including general education courses, he said. ""For the time being it uses all types of courses in non-Western cultures, but the ideal would be to design courses to be logical developments of Contemporary Civilizations [CC] and Literature Humanities [Lit Hum] that would fit into the core ideal,"" Smit said. The faculty accepted all but one of the de Bary Commission's suggestions, rejecting only the call for the standing committe to ""assist the deans and department in the recruitment of new faculty and promotion of those now in service to insure that the instructional needs of the core curriculum are given due weight in the selection process."" ""What the recommendation would do is involve the commission in recruiting people for departments. The departmens want to be sovereign and don't want instructions from an alien source,"" Smit said. The faculty would not have accepted the de Bary report without the deletion, according to Professor of English and comparative literature Joan Ferrante. The elimination of the recruiting stipulation will not hamstring the standing committee, according to Paul Anderer, associate professor of East Asian Languages and cultures. However, Smit may find it necessary to reinstate the recommendation, or something similar to it, according to Anderer. The controversial stipulation is unnecessary because departments already recruit people who are interested in teaching core classes, Pollack said. Smit said he would push fora reinstatement of the Chamberlain fellowships, paid year-long leaves of absence granted to CC preceptors after two years of teaching, which wereeliminated three years ago. ""Preceptors sacrifice a lot. The first year [of teaching] they are not capable of working on their dissertations so they deserve something like Chamberlain leave for time sacrificed on their career goals,"" he said. The standing committee will hold its first meeting within two weeks, Smit said. Smit added that he envisions a core curriculum which deals with issues that cast light on current events. ""The reading list in the core curriculum should be consistent with contemporary problems on an abstract level. It shouldn't be a canon,"" he said. The charter for the committee will expire at the end of the term, pending the faculty's reaction to a report on science education at Columbia College, Pollack said. The committee to review the science requirement has completed its final report and given it to Pollack, but he has not yet responded to it, he said. The faculty may instruct the standing committee to review the recommendations of the science report, Pollack said. Standing committee members include four tenured professors, two assistant professors, the directors of CC, Lit Hum, Art Humanities and Music Humanities, the director of the Heyman Center for the Humanities, and two students, to be nominated by the Academic Affairs subcommittee of the Columbia College Student Council and approved by Pollack, according to Smit. More members will be added to deal with specific problems as they arise, he said. The student members have not been chosen because Pollack has yet to notify the academic affairs committee of the creation of the standing committee, according to academic affairs Committee Chair Jane Murphy, CC '89.Jacob Smit"
52,Art Humanities,Guidelines set to evaluate classes for extended core,17 May 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzIn the first major step in converting the current Major Cultures requirement into an ""extended core curriculum,"" guidelines for extended core classes were approved earlier this month by the Columbia College Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum. The guidelines will be used to judge existing courses currently included in the Major Cultures requirement and to develop new courses, according to Committee Chair Jacob Smit, Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History. However, the current budget crunch facing the University will preclude any sweeping changes from occurring for at least two years, Smit said. Funding is needed to develop new courses and to hire new teachers,since many of the extended core classes will involve small departments, such as East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALAC), he said. The committee will also canvass funds from educational foundations to develop the new courses, Smit said. Until then, he said courses currently fulfilling the Major Cultures requirement will be evaluated according to the new guidelines, but new ones will not be created. The list for next semester's requirement should be completed in a few weeks, Smit said. A two-term extended core was proposed last semester by a commission created by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack to review the core, which was chaired by JohnMitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary. The Standing Committee on the core was created by the faculty earlier this term to continually review the core, following another recommendation by the deßary commission. The Major Cultures requirement, which replaced the Remoteness Requirement last September, calls for all Columbia College students to take two approved courses in areas which address cultures outside the Western world. Many students have complained that the classes are too large and that the subjects covered are too specific. The new guidelines state that the extended core is ""meant to build on the work of the existing"" core classes, which include Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities, Art Humanities and Music Humanities, by ""enlarging the scope and inquiry beyond the primary Western focus . . . and extending their subject matter to include questions and problems of the contemporary world."" The guidelines state that all extended core courses must address either a non-Western culture or civilization, or a contemporaryissue, such as racism or environmental problems. Students will be required to take at least one civilization course, and can fulfill the second term of the extended core requirement with either an issues course or a civilization course, Smit said. The committee decided to emphasize the civilization aspect of the extended core to address what it saw as the core's biggest deficiency, Smit explained. The civilization courses will address material independent from Western tradition, although all cultures will be seen as interacting with each other, he said. ""We will be dealing with these things as Westerners trying to understand and respect the cultures on their own terms,"" Smit said. All of the courses ""should engage the students in the disputatious learning that the existing core tries to cultivate,"" according to the guidelines. Smit added that the committee recommends a 40-student cap on all extended core classes. The guidelines diminish the number of graduate courses which would be included in the list, Smit said.Classes with a majority of graduate students tend to get overly technical, thus undermining the general education emphasis and discussion which the extended core should embody, he said. ""Graduate level courses would not necessarily be excluded, but in general we do not want to approve courses in which there are a large number of graduate students, though a sprinkling is okay,"" Smit said. Committee members also discussed whether to include courses which teach defunct civilizations, according to committee member Professor of Art History and Archeology Richard Brilliant. Just as CC texts written 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece are relevant to modern society, other ancient civilizations may yield pertinent works and ideas, Brilliant explained. Smit said extinct cultures warrent examination, especially in the case of the Aztecs, since a large amount of modern Mexican culture is based on currents stemming from the ancient period. Dorsey Dunn, CC '91, one of two studenj representatives on the Standing Committee, said the contemporary issues courses wouldsatisfy student concerns that certain issues, such as gender and racial issues, be addressed. Smit said he was interested in student concerns and would talk to student representatives about concerns of the student body. In a related decision, the Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI) approved the deletion of a rule which called for students to take their Major Cultures classes in subject areas other than their major. Smit, who serves on the COI, said professors in EALAC complained that their students were put at a disadvantage because many of the Major Cultures courses are EALAC courses. Smit called the original distinction ""bureaucratic,"" and said the Standing Committee had concluded that ""there was no connection whatsoever between the two requirements,"" before relaying that decision to the COI. The decision will be applied retroactively, but only to those courses which are still on the list in the fall, Smit said.HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE: Student Senators Veena Sud, BC '89, and Warigia Bowman, CC '90, present University President Michael Sovern with Michael the pet rat."
53,Art Humanities,CC core curriculum expands beyond west,30 August 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzIn response to criticism that the Columbia College Core Curriculum is eurocentric, sexist, and outdated, a new requirement encompassing courses on non-Western cultures, women, minoriries, and contemporary issues will go into effect this year. The new requirement and other aspects of the core will be constantly reviewed and modified by a new standing committee composed of Columbia College faculty members and students. The two semester ""extended core,' as it is called, requires all incoming students, as well as this year's sophmores and juniors, to take at least one course in a non-Western culture and the other course on either a second culture or a contemporary issue such as women's rights. The courses which satisfy the requirement are printed on a list available in the Registrar's office and the Dean of Student's office. The extended core replaces last years Major Cultures requirement, which required two semesters of study in an area other than Western culture. Complaints about the requirement were based on the lack of focus of the courses which fulfilled the requirement, and severe overcrowding in the classes. If students have already completed the Major Cultures requirement, they will not be responsible for the extended core. The standing committee defined the courses for the extended core by refining the Major Cultures requirement list. The committee also suggested a limit of40 students per class for extended core classes, though demand may overwhelm any such restriction. Additionally, according to the chair of the committee, Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History Jacob Smit, courses used for the extended core will also count for towards majors and concentrations, which was not the case for the major cultures requirement. The idea for an extended core came from a committee of professors commissioned by former Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack to evaluate and make recommendations for the core. The commission, chaired by John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary, reaffirmed the bulk of the core. The core still consists of the two semester sequences of Literature Humanities (Lit-Hum) and Contemporary Civilizations (CC), and one semester each of Music Humanities and Art Humanities. However, the commision did propose the extended core, as well as the formation of the standing committee. Though it has started to define the new requirement, the standing committee has yet to form the core of the extended core by developing new courses which use the seminar method of Lit Hum and CC. That will take time, money, and more money. Besides requiring funding for research, which Smit said he hopes to obtain from educational foundations, many new professors will need to be hired—both to deal with the new de-mand for courses which are taught from what have been small departments at Columbia and to accomodate the 40 student limit for the classes Since faculty members are hired through the departments, not by Columbia College, any approvals for mass hirings for the extended core will have to be approved by the central ad-ministration of the University. Not an easy task. Smit has said that it will be a few years before the new courses are developed and put into place. But the extended core, if all goes well, promises to address compelling modern thoughts and trends while allowing the continuation of the traditional core courses."
54,Art Humanities,"""Pencil book"" confusion caused by sick employees",30 January 1990,"By Kirsten DanisThe serious illnesses of two administrators and death of another administrator in the Office of Student Information Services (OSIS) have resulted in this semester's problems with room assigments and pencil book misprints, according to Donald Burd, associate director of student systems. Although the registration period is traditionally marred by confusion, the beginning of this semester has been especially hectic because OSIS Coordinator Lilyan Chapman and her immediate supervisor OSIS Developmental Analyst Robert Zuleg are both suffering from serious illnesses, he said. OSIS has also had to deal with the sudden death of its djrector, Ronald Moe, who oversaw the office's activities. Moe died on Jan. 17 of undisclosed causes. Chapman, who coordinates classroom assisgnments, has been on an indefinite leave of abscence dueto an undisclosed illness which required operations over the summer and last semester, Burd said. According to Bursar William Feimer, who is currently handling Moe's responsibilities, Chapman has coordinated classroom assignments for many years and knows the job's intricacies. ""Lilyan Chapman has been here fora long period of time. When someone like that is not available, you lose a lot of history and a lot of knowledge,"" Feimer said. The loss of Chapman and Moe was compounded by the unexpected illness of Zuleg, who suffered an aneurism and cerebral hemorrhage Thanksgiving week, Burd said. Zuleg, who was coordinating Chapman's responsibilites, has not been working at OSIS since Thanksgiving week and is currently in rehabilitation at Pennsylvania hospital, Feimer said.Since Chapman and Zuleg were jointly responsible for coordinating classroom space, this semester has been chaotic for OSIS, he added. ""You can't lose two key people like that in basically the same area in such a short time span without considerable loss to your department,"" Feimer said. The result has been confusion, especially in classroom assigments, Burd said. ""It's been a total disaster,"" he said. Scheduling Coordinator Lenore Hubner is presently overseeing room assignments, but coordinating space is not her regular job, Burdsaid. The pencil book, which lists classes and their locations, was incomplete or inaccurate for many undergraduate courses, he added. OSIS published three updates, which were available during registration week, to accompany the pencil book, Burd said. Mostly undergraduate classes were misscheduled, according to Burd. ""The professional schools were all set with rooms very early so those classes are complete and accurate. Others were not complete at deadline and not accurate in the pencil book,"" he said.According to Burd, OSIS does not coordinate the classroom assignments for the professional schools, including the Law and Business Schools, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Burd said that OSIS has controlled the scheduling problem and does not anticipate much more confusion. There have been no complaints to his office about double room assignments, Burd said. ""I'm not denying that it's true, but I don't have any firsthand reports of it,""he said. ""They're just not contacting us."" Feimer said he only knew of two cases aboutroom assignment problems in his office. Hovever, an employee in the Department of Contemporary Civilizations (CC) and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) who did not wish to be identified, said the first week of classes was ""horrible."" According to the employee, the CC and Lit Hum office received many complaints about double—and sometimes triple—room assignments. The employee added that the office received calls from students with questions about Art Humanities, History, and Barnard College classes."
55,Art Humanities,Seminar to mold extended core course,1 February 1990,"By Kirsten Fermaslichv 0 Columbia's first attempt to create special inter-disciplinary classes to fulfill the Extended Core requirement will take place this Friday in a seminar for professors and graduate students from different academic fields. The seminar is the first of a series designed to create a class called ""Social Hierarchies in the Contem-porary West,"" according to Professor of History and Director of the Center of Women and Gender Studies Martha Howell, who organized the seminars. The series of seminars was funded by the Ford Foundation, according to Howell. The course is intended to be a follow-up to Contemporary Civiliza-tions, and will be designed in a similar fashion, with a syllabus of mostly primary sources and a probable class enrollment of 30 to 35 students, Howell said. Contemporary Civilizations, along with Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities, which are taught in a discussion-styleformat, constitute Columbia College's Core Curriculum. ""It does follow very nicely from [Contemporary Civilizations] . . . It's a study of the failures of [Contemporary Civilizations],"" Howell said. At the beginning of the fall semester, the Columbia College Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum, changed last year's Major Cultures requirement to an Extended Core requirement. The Extended Core requires Columbia College students to take either two courses in non-Western culture, or one nonWestern course and one class which deals with contemporary issues, such as race or gender. The Extended Core requirement is now fulfilled through a list of already existing classes on race, gender, and non-Western societies. - Because current Extended Core classes are often graduate-level classes, or classes otherwise inappropriate for introducing students to other cultures, Columbia College is attempting to create classes similar to Core Curriculum classes that will introduce students to different cultures or important modern topics, according to Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis. ""They're [Extended Core requirements] really designed to introduce students to another culture. The problem is we are implementing the program as we are developing it . . . it's been bumpy in its implementation. It's growing, it's developing,"" Yatrakis said. The social hierarchies class is the first class to be developed solely for the Extended Core requirement and will ideally serve as a model for other Extended Core classes, Howell said. ""It's the beginning of fundamentally confronting contemporary issues through the Core Curriculum,"" Howell said. The seminars being held this semester areintended to allow professors to discuss the intellectual issues and questions behind social hierarchies, and then to find readings that will address these issues, Howell said. The seminars will also allow the professors to better understand the contemporary issues and viewpoints different from their own areas of expertise, according to Assistant Professor of History Atina Grossman, who will participate in the seminar. ""People who focus on gender also need to focus on race,"" Grossman said. The committee's work will only serve as a model syllabus for the course in social hierarchies which will eventually arise from the seminars, according to Howell. The actual syllabi will vary widely from professor to professor, she added. ""At least we will have set up a kind of model that individual professors can tailor to fit their individual concerns,"" said Assistant Professor of Engllish and Comparative Literature Marcellus Blount, who will also attend the seminar. The course, which will ideally be taught in more than one section, will be offered next year, Howell said, although only about 60 students will probably be able to register for it. The number of students should increase each year as more professors are willing and able to offer the class, she said. Other professors attending the seminar are Assistant Professor of History Elizabeth Blackmar, Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature Sussan Winnett, Associate Professor of Anthropology Katherine Newman, Associate Professor of Sociology Mark Mizruchi, and Assistant Professor of Sociology Wanda Morris. Howell said that she chose the professors who will participate in the seminar.BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY: Alma Mater's little sister looks uptown from Straus Park, which will soon be renovated."
56,Art Humanities,A Columbia education summed up,16 May 1990,"By Joshua C. GilletteYou can do a lot in four years. To take just one example, between the years of 1470 and 1474 two Germans in the Danish Service, Didrick Pining and Hans Pothorst, undertook a voyage to Iceland and the west, supposedly at the request of the king of Portugal; the evidence does not show that they went beyond Greenland. To take another: between the years of 1986 and 1990,1 and a couple hundred other people went to Columbia. I know about the Pining-Pothorst pilgrimage because I looked it up in a big World History encyclopedia I got in high school. Such books are generally available; a Columbia education is pricier and harder to come by. While the former offers a chronologically arranged history of humankind from the Paleolithic Period to the present and an index of over 200 pages for quick, easy-to-read reference, the latter is valued more highly by society for its requirement that students engage and grapple with the eternal questions that arise out of the variegated fields of human endeavor, and for the fact that its binding does not break and cause it to fall off the shelf and send tumbling all the books it was holding up. But given these valuable features, how well does this education work? Can it be means-tested? Forget the stuff outside the classroom—nobody has to pay a hundred grand to make posters, play chess, help the disadvantaged or suck in their cheeks, wear maroon jackets and sing. Of course we learned more outside the classroom, from our peers. We're also in a very special period in our lives, full of wide-ranging emotion, activity and accomplishment; the deans appreciated our participation in the life of the College and will miss each of us in a different way; we'll treasure these memories forever; and we lived in the only college town in Manhattan—Morningside Heights. And Dial soap is better in several aspects from any other skin-cleansing product. Never mind the copy and agitprop—we need results, cold hard data on what a Columbia education teaches. With eight semesters of liberal education under my gown, what do I know now that I didn't before? And did it require four years that could have been more prudently allocated? In the interests of science and in the spirit of the oversimplification that inevitably results when journalism and academics mix, to prove that college students know a little something—and nothing more than that little something—about lots of things, and to save time for high schoolers considering putting off their own voyages to Iceland and the west until after college, I'd like to offer this handy resource for autodidacts: Everything I Learned in College. Columbia, like many colleges, has its wondrous moments of joyous selffulfillment and discovery (cf. your school's yearbook).

Fascism: It could happen here if we don't look out, because the Germans and Italians weren't dummies—they, in fact, cared more about a candiate's positions and politics than his marriage and hair color. British History: Britain declined from quite an empire to not so great an empire. Attitude, Action, and Reason: To justify their behavior, many people point to reasons which, if they thought about it,would emerge as silly; everything we do can be reduced to motions of the body; emotions are very complicated combinations of sensation, belief, physiological reaction, behavior, and judgements; therefore, I should just own up and say I used to hit my little brother because I felt like it. Comparative Modern Fiction: The modern novel decentered the subject, played out the subjective obsessions of the modern artist in highly-charged prose, and was, frankly, in certain cases much longer than it really needed to be. Glib reductionism? Maybe. But keep in mind, ours was the MTV generation, nursed on TV news soundbites and told we weren't culturally literate, that we had know-nothing American minds just barely ajar and snapping shut fast. What did manage to sneak in were factoids, bereft of context and proportion, they said. That I am able to pluck complete sentences out of the rapidly-shifting video-like montage that is my memory of these courses is, I propose, a modest but notable coup. Perhaps as my fellow graduates tally their totals, I'll emerge the deviant one. Perhaps process is more important than product, becoming educated more important than being educated. Maybe the typical Columbia graduate in 1990 remembers more than a few disjointed, impressionistic fact-blotches or conceptettes from each class. Columbia does attract people with uncanny abilities to sustain intense interest in the recondite minutiae of esoteric topics—witness Modern Times writers (and readers). And some people did tape record the lectures in my economics class. So I could be wrong. But I suspect that for most of us, the one other thing I learned in Comparative Modern Fiction, from Nabokov's Lolita, wraps up the collegiate enterprise as we underwent it:""I am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing everything."" Actually, I got that out of a book of quotations. Q.E.D.Joshua C. Gillette is a former Spectator Editor-in-Chief and will graduate Cum Laude from Columbia College today."
57,Art Humanities,Spectrum Core is threatened by watered down requirements,11 October 1990,"Core is threatened by watered down requirementsColumbia College's Extended Core requirement is a sham which both institutionalizes radicalism and dishonors the non-Western civilizations whose study it purports to encourage. Columbia, unlike Stanford, has weathered the 1980s with its Core Curriculum largely intact. However, the Extended Core fiasco is a vivid reminder that pandering to the ""politically correct"" can be institutionalized in ways much less obvious than Stanford's total capitulation to chants of ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western Culture's gotta go.""The 1990-1991 Columbia College Bulletin states that the Extended Core builds upon the traditional Core Curriculum of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and Music and Art Humanities, by ""enlarging the scope and inquiry beyond the primary Western focus of the existing courses and extending their subject matter to include problems and questions of the contemporary world."" To fiilfill this inandate, students are required to take two courses approved by one of Columbia's innumerable Deans and committees, one of which must ""involve major cultures beyond those encountered in the core."" There are two problems with all of this seemingly high-minded educational rhetoric. The first problem is that the Extended Core is at odds with the educational principle that underlies the Core itself: to teach, in Matthew Arnold's memorable phrase, ""the best that has been thought and done.'' That indeed is thewhole point of the Core, and the reason it has produced such fierce anger; it is designed to represent the best of Western civilization in literature, political theory, philosophy, music, and art. The Extended Core makes no such claim, and, as a result, does not represent the best of non-Western civilizations or of anything else, but in large part simply whatever happens to be taught in a particular semester. As a result, there is an implication that ANYTHING non-Western is suitable to stand alongside Aeschylus and Raphael: this clearly covers such courses as W3145 'Third World Cinema,' W3560 'Latin American Politics,' and V 3715 'Persons/selves a comparative perspective.' This juxtaposition both degrades the very idea of excellence, and deprives students of the chance to discover the very real achievements of non-Western civilizations. In many cases, this also serves to reinforce the preconceptions held by many students about the inferiority of non-Western culture. Yet even this not so trivial slight to the actual merit of non-Western cultures pales next to the so called 'Contemporary Issues Option' in the Extended Core. Though alluded to, this option is not mentioned at all in the 1990-1991 Columbia College Bulletin. It rather is to be found on the last two pages of the most recent (September 1990) 'Extended Core Requirement Approved Course List,' courses and may be used to satisfy one semester of the Extended Core Requirement. These courses are nothing but ventures in how to be 'politically correct' on a wide variety of issues, ranging from the nebulous --V3127 'Personal relations'— to the socio-logical --C3932 'Social hierarchies in the contemporary West'-- with stops along the way for revisionist history~W3Blo 'The Vietnamese revolution and its associated wars'— and the cutting edge --C3178 'lntroduction to Gender.' I have no objection to the study of these topics. But they do not belong in a general j education curriculum, being as they are at once too specialized and too topical. Moreover, the titles of the courses indicate an avowedly leftist agenda in the background that is all the more offensive because it is so blatant. There can be no doubt; the 'Contemporary Issues Option' is really an injunction to studyin depth the radical propaganda that is the common fare of campus life today. To restore the Extended Core to credibility, two steps must be taken: the Contemporary Issues Option must be completely eliminated, and the list of courses offered in satisfaction of the requirement must be stripped both of courses on the list because of convenience,and of courses there because of politics. Only then can the Extended Core receive anything but knowing smiles from the left and knowing sneers from the right.Right on Edward Lipman"
58,Art Humanities,Undergrads begin early registration,16 January 1991,"By Elizabeth Berke Spectator Staff WriterA total of 2,930 undergraduates participated in the first early registration offered at Columbia, but it is not yet clear if that registration was a success, according to Deputy Vice President of Student Finances and Information Services Mark Olson. Between Nov. 12 and Dec. 21, first-year students and sophomores at Columbia College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), and the School of General Studies (GS) were able to section for classes that required automated sectioning, and to register for all other classes. A subcommittee on class scheduling, enrollment, and registration, which was created last year by the University Senate, proposed early registration, according to University Registrar Joseph Capobianco. Capobianco added that he knew of the proposal for early registration in the fall, when he first came to Columbia. ""The interest in early registration was made clear to me when I first came on,"" he said. ""The new people and the older people worked together to make this happen."" Because early registration is a new program, it is limited to a smallnumber of students to ensure success, according to Capobianco. ""Early registration was limited, but made available to a large enough number of students so that it could be successful,""Capobianco said. Olson said he is planning to expand early registration next year and to computerize the process. ""We anticipate expansion, but we do not know how much yet. The new computer system that will be phased in in the next 18 to 24 months will enhance student services,"" Olson said. Patricia McLaughlin, an Office of Student Information Services staff member who works at the Columbia College Desk in Kent Hall, said that adjusting to the new registration system will require students to be patient. ""It's going to be hard for students to figure out because it's a new system,"" McLaughlin said. ""It's going to take a little time, but if it works out, it's going to be a great thing for the students."" Student reaction to early registration was mixed. Columbia College students were generally pleased with the results, but many SEAS students complained of problems. ""I assume I'm registered for allmy classes, but I haven't received anything in the mail yet,"" Meghan Heather, CC '94, said. Alisa Braun, CC '94, said she was very positive about early registration. ""I got everything I wanted,"" Braun said. ""I think it's a really good opportunity for people who know what classes they want."" Steve Yung, SEAS '94, said he was scheduled for an engineering course that he did not sign up for, and was originally told he was scheduled into an Art Humanities class for which he is not now registered. ""It's stupid that you have to register twice,"" Yung said. Wina Lee, SEAS '93, said that she did not get the sections for which she asked and that she did not receive her registration receipts. ""We still end up going through sectioning and doing add-drops. It was a disaster,"" Lee said. Assistant Director of Columbia College Drew Scopelleti said he had not encountered many problems with early registration. ""At this time last year, there were hordes of students coming in to have their schedules signed, butSPECTATOR FILE PHOTO NOT ANOTHER HOLD FROM THE LIBRARY: Some fortunate undergraduates were allowed to register early this semester.

59,Art Humanities,A Cultural Mecca,21 February 1991,"By Tim GriffinIndeed, Columbia lives up to its brochures. A Bernardo Bertolucci film premieres in New York City. Immediate-ly, a mass exodus of refined Columbians follow the burning cloud of culture down the one line. Exclamations and fervor abound on the campus (secretly, students rejoice at the prospect of the refined date: an alternative to the MoMA, old hat). Surely, we educate ourselves in the cultural mecca of the United States, if not the world. Surely, we fulfill the prophesies of Schiller, we complete the task set before us in the spirit of the Core Curriculum: we cultivate ourselves, in all the multiplicity of our internal possibility. And perhaps, with continued effort, we achieve the internal balance and moderation glorified in the Biblical text of our Columbia education, ""The Republic""—albeit a balance attained through the exposure to art forms which Plato himself might have called ""illusion."" But is it only art which might be called ""illusion"" in this case? Is there the possibility that, somehow, Columbia students are not achieving such a cultivation and balance, but instead are subtly and nimbly defying the supple sheen of culture, intellectualism, metropolitanism and ""IvyLeague-ism"" endowed upon them by the American media and groups such as the MLA (although the latter half of that statement may in fact also be an illusion, or perhaps even a third-order illusion? We, like the artists of New York, bumblingly attempt to embody aesthetically the ideas of the latest French philosophers. How truly cultivated, how truly cosmopolitan we are!)? In this unlikely scenario, the vast majority of Columbia students would not engage in the cultural events of the city. They would remain on campus, rent the occasional movie, hang out at local bars, ""Twin Peaks"" in the dormitory lounge would be an artistically stimulating evening. Although this scenario is unlikely, let us, for the sake of argument, assume that it is factual. How do students at this sort of Columbia expose themselves to New York's artistic community? With respect to the Columbia education, they expose themselves via class requirements for Art and Music Humanities. They study art history, go to museums, become artistically refined and hang Klimt posters on their walls. Thus the impression of art's spirit is made upon the Columbian's soul, and an appreciation for the visual arts is permanently engendered. As one former Art Humanities professor said, ""This course will make you forever good at cocktail parties."" Indeed, the Columbian soul finally achieves the ends of its education. We actually see this cultivation in action as Columbia students turn to the city and investigate its cultural events. Upon finishing the Art and Music Humanities requirements, the most refined students sprint to the nearest newsstand and pick up a New York Times. ""Perfect,"" they say, grinning with exuberance, ""there's an exhibition at the MoMA, Ashkenazy is playing at Alice Tully, and Film Forum has a Bergman retrospective. Now who should I go with?"" The students are excited that they fullyintegrate themselves into the New York cultural scene, and that Art and Music Humanities were not rooted in a sort of historicism in which current trends andproblems of art and music are for the most part neglected. Their education encourages them to go beyond the established arenas of culture; not only do they go to Carnegie Hall to hear Beethoven, but they frequentcutting-edge artistic scenes like Film Forum to see a Bertolucci. So we see the Columbia students' cultivation completed, because it is important to the students themselves. They study the history of art and music but want to go beyond it, making it a real part of their lives, applying this knowledge to current trends in the arts, keeping up to date with cultural events, realizing that there is more to art than just the proclaimed masters such as Picasso or Beethoven. They scour the pages of the New York Times (a hotbed for cultural alternatives) in order to find readings by the current literary figures, because they know that art strengthens the soul. Most importantly, their cultivated souls demand that they educate themselves through these cultural engagements, thereby avoiding an unfortunate situation: a body of students experiencing a purely historical liberal arts education, ironically failing to go into the city and gain first-hand experience of the liberal arts.One of the mastersGrand illusion"
60,Art Humanities,Make Columbia a recommendable institution,15 May 1991,"By Edward LipmanStrange things happen to graduating seniors. Not being a scientist (or a philosopher), I will not try to give an explanation of these odd occurrences. I shall simply relate the facts. About a week ago I found myself at a cocktail party discussing life and happiness with a high school junior from Pennsylvania. Without any conscious desire to do so, I began to do something that readers of my column would think unlikely from the author of ""Right on"": I endeavored to convince this intelligent, well-mannered, and attractive young lady to apply to Columbia! In itself, this might not be so startling; it could, among other things, be put down to the wily machinations of Messrs. Johnny Walker and Jim Beam (the occasion in question was, after all, a cocktail party). But several days later, I discovered a missive from the Columbia alumni admissions people in the morning mail, containing a form letter inviting me to sign on as some sort of Columbia representative to high-schoolers in my area. Without premeditation, I eagerly scanned the letter,filled out the enclosed form, mailed it, and began looking forward to snaring New York City's best and brightest for good old Alma Mater. Can this be? The author of so many diatribes against the woeful state of Columbia becoming an honest to God booster? The man who has attacked administration, faculty, and students for their moral bankruptcy and utter disregard for learning? Yes. My purpose in my polemical columns was to try to make sure that Columbia would remain an institution worth attending. And after my four years, I can say—with somereservations-that Columbia offers an excellent education that holds its own against all comers, including the mighty Harvard. To begin with, our Core Curriculum is a real curriculum in which one reads real books in a generally straightforward fashion. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization remain challenging, serious courses where students are introduced to great worksEdward Lipman, a Spectator columnist, will graduate from Columbia College today.of philosophy, political theory, and literature. For all its faults, Logic and Rhetoric remains an intensive exercise in the writing of English prose. Music Humanities and Art Humanities remain centered upon the great music and art of Western civilization. ""Street Slang 101"" will not yet fulfill the language requirement, nd the science requirement promises to be v even better as it is expanded to two full years. But the Core is, thankfully, not all of one's education at Columbia. Much time is spent taking courses in one's major, and for the student with any scholarly inclination majors abound where the wisdom and teaching of great scholars are readily available. Though the English and history departments care too little about undergraduates and all too much \ about radical politics, small but academically outstanding departments such as classicseagerly welcome the interested student. Although the elimination of the geography and the linguistics departments is to be deplored, and no doubt indicates an alarming trend that must be fought against, scholarship is not yet dead at Columbia. Beyond the classroom there is New York. I never cease to wonder at the transformation that so many of my friends have undergone during their four years here; the intellectual and social sophistication of New York seems to leave no one untouched, even if few Columbians are to be seen in used bookstores, at the opera, or at off-off-Broadway shows. Unlike the boutique colleges (such as, let us say, Bennington), Columbia does have a diverse student body. Diverse, that is, in a good sense, not diverse in the sense of a quota-filled experiment in social engineering.I would be unfair to my Muse if I neglected to mention the bad parts of Columbia. The dorms are terrible, mostly due to the animallike habits of the students who live in them. Students who come from morally conservative backgrounds will find myriad and insistent invitations to sin that their parents could never have dreamed of when they wrote out the check to Columbia. Our school lacks the elegance and refinement still present in some measure at some of our more conspicuous Ivy brethren, and any visions prospective students have of well-dressed, intellectual undergraduates sitting around in front of a fire drinking sherry with a great scholar had better be laid to rest without further ado. Although the Core Curriculum is quite good on paper, the quality of the actual classes depends all too much on one's teachers: I, for instance, had a frightfullyrotten Music Humanities class, a horrible first semester of Physics for Poets, and an equally atrocious Logic and Rhetoric class; I also had a mediocre Contemporary Civilization class. Every other Core course that I took, however, was truly first-rate. Indeed, with the exception of two electives in addition to the abovenamed Core courses, every class I took at Columbia was first-rate. But when it comes right down to it, Columbia offered me more of an education than I ever could have taken advantage of. And for that, I trust I may be forgiven a certain sentimentality as I take leave of the Light Blue (even if I never did go to a football game or sing ""Roar, Lion, Roar""!). Right on, Columbia? Not quite, but close."
61,Art Humanities,Wipeout,6 September 1991,"Sleeping should now be a little easier for those who are terrified of water or feel bogged down by all of Columbia College's requirements. The recent decision by the Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI) to eliminate the 75-meter swimming test from the list of degree requirements will, pending a final decision by the Columbia College faculty in late September, make graduating much easier for all. Interestingly, the swim requirement has been omitted from the 1991-1992 Columbia College Bulletin. Many esteemed graduates from Michael Sovern to John Kluge could not have gotten to where they are today without having completed the swimming requirement (though they might not acknowledge this). Yet other successful alumni who were unable to pass the test did not receive their Bachelor of Art degrees from Columbia College. Although knowing how to swim is an important skill, it should not be a necessary requirement like Contemporary Civilization or Art Humanities. Columbia College students will not be the only beneficiaries of this change. Eliminating the swim test will also free the physical education department from the bureaucratic tangle created by forms, waivers, and processing which often results from testing students. For those who wish to learn how to swim, however, classes will continue to be offered. The School of Engineering's COI will also be considering removing its own swimming requirement and we urge them to follow the lead taken by Columbia College. Now that a B.A. is 75 meters shorter than it used to be, Columbia College students can graduate without an unneccessary requirement, and the physical education department can avoid an additional bureaucratic mess."
62,Art Humanities,Core should encompass global issues,24 September 1991,"By Mitchell M. WongPerhaps the greatest accomplishment of Columbia University is the formation of the Core Curriculum, which offers a strong and fundamental understanding of Western philosophy and thought. For over half a century, it has been the paragon of social education and the envy of countless institutions of higher learning. However, the value of the Core simply cannot be measured by comparison to other syllabi, but by its utility in the real world. Under such scrutiny, it seems that the Core is rapidly becoming more and more archaic in the ace-deration of the fast paced world we live in today. The Core Curriculum was created in response to World War I in 1919 with the birth of the Contemporary Civilization syllabus. The goal of the course was to educate students in recognizing (and, if possible, nullifying) the causes of dissension and violent resolution. This was to be accomplished by requiring students to read pieces of literature which influenced the development of current society. Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities were added to the Core in 1937 to supplement Contemporary Civilizationthrough studies of the creative spirit in Western culture. Since then, the Core has not been significantly modified. However, the world has changed dramatically over those 54 years. The 1990s preside oVer a world of incalculable speed and never-ending change. The emergence of a global economy and unhindered communication has shattered the supposedly impenetrable and eternal geographical barriers which, until now, have sheltered the complacent solitude of the United States. The West is no longer the sole cause of international events. The worldwide concern over the Gulf War clearly demonstrates this point. As for the Core's present usefulness, did it offer any insight into the delicate policies and decisions made by Iraq, Israel, the Middle Eastern countries, and the rest of the world during the Gulf War? Could the attitudes of the Chinese communist hardliners who crushed and hunted the Tienanmen Square protesters be discerned using the Core as a guide? How much of the Core could be applied to examining the mutation of democracy into a bloody series of slaughters by Monrovian leaders? When these questions are asked, it seems that although the Core offers an advantageous overview of Western culture, if provides, at best, a myopic understanding of African, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern cultures. The extended Core is incapable of covering such cultures with the same depth the Core covers Western civilization. With such a deficiency, how can the Core successfully fulfill its goal of unearth-ing the multicultural roots of modern day society for inspection? It is time for the Core to be rewritten with a global consideration in mind. Significant texts and works of art from non-Western cultures should be completely integrated into the Core and not taught separately as an addendum Extended Core. This should be done even if Core courses have to be expanded into additional terms or hours. The priceless advantage of having such different works taught side byside is that it allows a student to develop a deeper appreciation of the intricate similarities, differences, and parallels between familiar Western culture and the less familiar nonWestern cultures. In lieu of the greater time commitment generated, the Extended Core requirement and the language requirement could be dropped since the former would already be introduced into the Core and the latter is simply a less efficient way of imparting an understanding of a foreign culture.Another arrangement may be to abridge the current Core by replacing works which address only one viewpoint with those that cover multiple topics or by condensing studies under a general category using only specific passages of texts or just fewer pieces of music or art. For example, Hrosvit's plays could be replaced by Tales of the Arabian Nights, which is (more enjoyably) told from the viewpoint of a woman and a non-Western culture. Monastic music need not be repeated ad nauseam whenjust an example or two of early Western music could be used in its place. The valuable time spent on repetition could be better used for a broader range of study. It is only after we have been rearmed in our knowledge of the ways of the world that we can safely assume our capacity to disempower those who would bring about conflict through unfamiliarity, misunderstanding, and trust.Mitchell M. Wong is a Columbia College sophomore."
63,Art Humanities,CC still trying to restore fellowships,3 October 1991,"By David ShayneDespite a seven-month search, Columbia administrators have been unable to find money to restore the Chamberlain fellowships for graduate students teaching Core Curriculum courses. The Chamberlain Fellowship, an incentive for graduate students and assistant professors to teach Core Curriculum courses for six semesters, was discontinued last spring for graduate students because of lack of funding. Core Curriculum coursesinclude Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. The fellowship, originally slated to be discontinued in spring 1989, was extended for an additional year with funding from a one-time donation from Columbia College Dean Jack Greenberg's office, according to Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis. The fellowship will not be reinstated next semester, but the option to restore it remains if funding becomes available, Yatrakis said. ""It would depend on the budget for next year,"" she said. Eliminating the fellowship was a mistake because the quality of the Core Curriculum is an integral part of the Columbia education, according to Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History J.W. Smit, who is head of Contemporary Civilization department. "" I felt it was a bad example to cut the central piece of the Columbia College education,"" Smit said. ""I felt the savings should have been made elsewhere."" Smit, who resigned from his position as chair of the Contemporary Civilization department after the fellowship was canceled, said he agreed to return to his post in July because Greenberg promised to raise funds for the fellowship. Greenberg's promise, however, does not guarantee that funds will be raised, Smit said. ""Obviously, he cannot promise me that at a certain point we willhave the money,"" he said. The fellowship for assistant professors remained even though it was canceled for graduate students. Smit said the cancellation of the fellowship for graduate students showed that ""preceptors do not have the clout of other groups."" When the cancellation was announced last spring, several preceptors said the cuts were unexpected and unfair. ""Because Dean Greenberg had restored the money temporarily, some of the preceptors felt the fellowship would continue,"" Smit said. Some of the first-year preceptors said they had not expected to receive the Chamberlin Fellowship. ' 'When I interviewed last spring,they didn't mention it to me,"" said Laura Gaughran, a preceptor for Contemporary Civilization. ' 'When I entered the program, it was completely moot. I didn't even feel like they were taking it away from me."" ""No one said anything to me [about the fellowship],"" said Preceptor John Ransom. ""No one has even asked me if I'm stickingaround next year."" If the Chamberlain fellowship is restored, Smit said he would like it to become a postdoctoral award to encourage graduate students who have completed their dissertations to teach for an additional year, Smit said. While in the past, departments granted graduate students annual one-year fel-lowships, some departments are now offering five-year fellowships, Smit said. The five-year fellowships will encourage graduate students to teach Core Curriculum courses for their final two years, Smit said, while completing their dissertations in seven years. Smit said he thinks students should beencouraged to teach for a third year after receiving their doctorate. ' 'When they teach for only two years, there is too much coming and going in the department,"" he said.Jacob Smit"
64,Art Humanities,Observations from an alienated CU African,24 March 1992,"By Isaac Kusi Sarfo' 'A Mabuiag man would cut off the head of the victim and let the dripping blood fall into his mouth; he would give some of the blood to the young man who accompanied, saying, 'You do not know how to fight. You drink it and it will give you a strong heart.' Tutu men drank the sweat of renowned warriors and ate scrapings from their fingernails, which had become saturated with human blood. A Tutu warrior would tear out the tongue of a man he had just killed and eat it on the spot. He would also cut off the penis of a slain enemy, preserve it, and blow through it in the direction he was going when it came time to fight again."" This ghastly unedited passage is an extract from the chapter ""Cannibalism"" of a book on head hunting that was assinged to be read in my Logic and Rhetoric class for a discussion of the ""Aristotlelian"" principle of cause and effect in ""Western thought."" The book was written in 1901 by a very sick missionary (I suppose) and I wonder how my instructor got to dig such a Kafkaesque piece. My instructor set about judiciously analyzing cannibalism and ""primitive"" cultures in general, once again (as always) placing Western civilization whereit ""properly"" belongs. I wondered whether my instructor, in choosing such material for discussion, really believed that such cannibals existed (other than that Milwaukee wacko), and was therefore preaching the virtues of Western civilization to avert a possible return to that primeval ""state of nature"" by his dear pupils, or had some other intention, being the Eurocentric fellow he is. Without prejudice, I eagerly followed the class, occasionally giving novel contributions from the metaphysical, pseudo-scientific, and other theories of knowledge of African societies that I know when for no apparent reason, my instructor started to turn the tables on me. With some high-sounding theories of philosophy which surely none of the class could understand, he demonstrated the primivity of my ideas, and by some very subtle linguistic engineering, gave the general impression that my African ideas were one and the same with those of the cannibals we were discussing. Thus I, who was suggesting an alternative philosophical system merely to enrich our discussion, was proved to be the pre-sci-entific African I am, or should haveIsaac Kusi Sarfo is a Columbia College freshman.been. I am a not-yet-sold-out African who only first came here last fall as a Columbia College freshman. And in all my interesting and so far very revealing core requirement classes, I try to bring in challenging ideas from my heritage on religious, social, and political issues, as well as other types of issues, that may not necessarily be my own. By so doing, the philosophical traditions which we all treasure so much are more sharply examined, and seen in a better light. More importantly, my personal range of culture is broadened as well as refined. Unfortunately, every time I reveal my identity I solicit a different, if not weird, reaction from most people. In the instance of my L&R class, I can safely say that now, to them, I come from a pagan, savage culture where reason does not exist. My instructor did not point to me and say, ""There sits your live specimen from such a cannibalist culture, hiding under Thornton Bay Classics and Cardiffe jeans. But he still betrays his mythopoeic-age emotive rationality with his voodoo choker and his wormy English, spoken through those blood-soaked, thick, ugly lips."" He was too subtle for me to pin down and send to the Ombuds office, but by deviously holding African thought to total ridicule, my instructor no doubt gave anerroneous image of African knowledge to most of the uninformed members of my class. Now they are going to get even more paranoid in dealing with accented, straight-up Africans (or, more generally, ""Third World"" international students) like me. In fact, my instructor was only continuing a gleeful sport of Western Christian supremacists. For centuries now, Africa has been viewed through a web of myth so pervasive and glib that there might never be anyone to clarify it. A warped written history, reinforced by the news media and their fantastic projection of television images of mostly false tribal savagery and the many unfortunate enviromental and other crises of Africa, have all generated the myth of the uncivilized African savage living in a continent darker than its Black peoples. This has been taken as truth to the extent that even some of our AfricanAmerican brothers and sister are forced by cultural forces around here to subscribe to these false myths and to disassociate themselves from Africa. It is a pathetic, even foolish misconception when, in this new age when Africans are writing the poems, singing the songs, and performing bold experiments, we are still looked upon as the ""missing links"" in some cosmographic ""chain of being"" theory. Actually, we've been doing great deeds throughout the ages and not only in this time.It is really not cool, to say the least, to have people look at you in the funny way that they do when you ""confess"" that you're an African. It's not cool that they ask you such stupid, ignorant questions as to how you managed to hear about Columbia in the jungle playing with all those funky monkeys. It's also not cool to have a brother or sister be nice to you in an isolated corner only to turn away the next time you see them in ""hip"" company. After all, the African dude doesn't know what's up, is less civilized. Even in the supposedly egalitarian, discursive environment of an Art Humanities class, you have people betting their lives on insisting that Picasso's women who look two ways at once are nothing but expressions of visually confrontational, primitive African savagery rather than a show of the artist's confessed appreciation for the way in which African art breaks out of the confines (such as perspective and measured naturalism) traditionally put on European art. So much for tolerance of diversity at Columbia. If ever there were a thing like the minor minority, then it would be me and the few other African students here who go about smiling to every soul and pretending that all is right. Meanwhile, deep within them, there is the ennui to have an ear to the pitiful anger growing like a tumor in the black depths of their plaintive throats. I am not here saying ""Here I am, son ofthe hunter king, come from the game fields of Ashanti. Studying with you and bettering you in Integral Computations with Parametric Curves, here at the 'cutting edge of knowledge and existence'."" Therefore, accept me as one of you for what I am--a very equal positive number."" lam what I am--Nana Kusi Apammr a Odi-Adwene Tor-tapper of the sage's wine. Simply, I am making some noise, in my own' 'primitive"" way, about the danger posed to the mentalities of the future leaders of America and the world by such high level brain-washing that justifies the superiority of the (already impressive) Western tradition by comparing it to nonexistent cannibalism, and worse, of using the treasured culture of a people as a parallel example of the latter. That is not to say that my people still have or ever had a culture of cannibalism. It is only that memories of Tarzan, the missionary in the stew pot, and Roots (yes, Roots) are awakened in the inexplicably paranoid mind's eye of the untravelled preppy at Columbia when cannibalism is documented in a classroom in a building dedicated to Hamilton. Such misinformation goes a long way to spoil meaningful cross-cultural enrichment amongst the diverse peoples here. Examples of this phenomenon are the everyday experiences of the African student in the classroom and residence hall; it is not befitting of Columbia. Ironically, my L&R instructor, at the ena of the class, asked himself the difference between eating human flesh, gassing it, and dropping bombs on it. He couldn't find any answers tothat and neither could anyone in the class. My conclusion is that we are all primitive at the baseline, no matter our level of sophistication. Or I might be wrong and we Nayabinghi kin may be the only truly wretched of the earth. Nevertheless, think about it. Dare to put aside that Norton Critical book you are stuck into under that ivy, and ask yourself, ""How far have I come and how far will I go?"" And please, unlike my dear ENGL CIOO7 instructor, don't kid yourself."
65,Art Humanities,CEPSR well-designed to suit professors' research,5 August 1992,"By Elizabeth Berke Spectator Summer Board. Most undergraduates at Columbia, whether in the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), Columbia College, Barnard College, or the School of General Studies, will never see the inside of the University's newest facility—the Morris A. Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Science Research (CEPSR). Funded mostly by grants from the State of New York, the building contains laboratories and research facilities that will be used by professors and graduate students. The interior is as smooth and modern as the outside, with black and white checkerboard floors,blue-gray doors, brightly colored cable encasements running down the hallways, and wood benches in the rest areas. It is also designed very intelligently and systematically. The labs are situated at the center of each floor, while the lounges and offices surround its periphery. It is set up for easy adaptability and change, according to Linda Spielman, assistant to SEAS Dean David Auston. Cable wires can be adjusted without tearing out walls, and computer cables and electrical outlets are under raised floors in many of the labs. ''It gives us a significant amount of more research space, and high quality space, with a lot of powerthere, and clean air. It's meant to be able to support sophisticated research,"" Spielman said. Spielman said the laboratories were placed at the center of the floors so that light from windows wouldnot interfere with light-sensi-tive experiments, and createa buffer between the labs and the outside of the building, in the unlikelihood something goes wrong. Service corridors in between the labs house storage closets, emergency showers, electrical hook ups, and any other special requirements, such as hydrogen or filtered air. ""The electrical power and the air supply go through the middle then out to the labs, which makes it easier to redo the rooms,"" Spielman said. For example, the clean-room, the lab that will be manufacturing computer chips, requires a dust-free environment, which means that highly filtered air must be pumped into the room. If the purpose of the lab is changed in the future, it will be possible to install more sophisticated filters. Paul Christianson, associate director of the Center for Telecommunications Research (CTR), said the easy adaptibility of the labs in CEPSR is ""one of the fundamental best things about the building,"" but he also warned that labs often outgrow their surroundings within a few years. Roughly half of the computer science and electrical engineering departments of SEAS have moved into the building, which will contain such programs as the ColumbiaVideo Network Off Campus Program, CTR, the Center for Advanced Technology in Computer and Information Systems, which is sponsored by New York State, Microelectronics Sciences Laboratories, Condensed Matter and Physics, and the Center for Intelligence System Research. The video network program, whose administrative offices will be located in CEPSR, broadcasts Columbia classrooms to such companies as IBM, AT&T, and NYNEX, enabling professionals to earn M.A.'s in electrical engineering, computer science, and material engineering from SEAS without actually attending classes on campus, according to Jill Chamberlain, Client Relations Representative for the program. Christianson said the move to CEPSR allowed the CTR to spread out its equipment and provide a more comfortable working environment. ""It let us breathe from an unbelievably tight situation in Mudd. What is now two full floors was one floor there,"" Christianson said. ""The facilities now make it more conducive for more reflective and energetic work."" ""Comfort level has a lot to do with the motivation level of people. I'd be quite surprised if we didn't see increases in the productivity of researchers,"" he added. Construction on the building began in 1986, after the State of New York provided a $1 million planning grant, which it followed with a $36 million interest-free loan that must be paid back in 40 years. In addition, SEAS provided $20million for the building. Spielman said the state contributed to the building in order to encourage research in the state. ""The idea was that the research in the building should provide support for high technology research and industry in the state,"" Spielman said. The building, which is 11 stories high, has three underground levels, which contain boiler plants and mechanical systems. The fourth floor houses an auditorium and seminar rooms, the fifth and eleventh floors contain mechanical systems to support the lab, and the remaining floors house research labs. Two labs in the building will remain unassigned in order to leave room for expansion, according to Spielman. In the CTR, professors and students are working on such highly diversified projects as high definition televisions (HDTVs), information transmission via fiber optics, and high-resonance computer screens. ""A lot of intensive and active research is going on there,"" Christianson said. More than 60 Ph.D. and about 20 M.A. candidates work at the CTR, where elaborate equipment, such as vibration isolation tables—huge, very heavy, very expensive metal slabs placed on cylinders of compressed gas that prevent the table from moving even the minutest amount—make it possible for themto train tiny lasers onto very small fibers. They are trying to make the fibers ""manipulate information rather than just carry it,"" according to Christianson. A student who was working at the lab as part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates, explained that light travels faster than electricity, and that she was attempting to make fibers transmit information at the speed of light, rather than at the speed of electricity, which is what is currently being done. The problem is that now, we need electricity (electrons) to convert the information sent by light (photons) to make it understandable, and that conversion takes time. For example, when you speak into your phone, electrons convert the sound into a transmittablewavelength, but once the sound makes it to the cord, it is converted to photons, and then back to electrons before it reaches the receiver at the other end. A team of researchers at CEPSR is working to make it possible to have photons do all the work. Lounges on each floor, complete with couches, refrigerators, coffee makers, (absolutely no eating in the labs), and on one floor, a personal video arcade game, allow the researchers a comfortable place to relax and take in the beautiful campus views. In the computer lab, students and professors are working together to create a distributive computer network—which will work almost like a supercomputer, but cost a lot less money. The system will involve linking several computers together on a high-speed network, thereby enabling all researchers to have access to more information and a moresophisticated computer system. At the lab, Christianson pointed out a three-tiered computer set-up, and said ""Someday, that rack will be put on a chip."" Christianson also explained why chemists need a high-powered computer system. ""Chemists don't mix anything anymore,"" he said. ""They do it all on computers. If they think it will work, they might mix it."" But they haven't forgotten about liberal arts students either. A system that could bring computer images of Art Humanities course paintings and sculptures to computers may be just a school year away, according to Christianson. Although he did admit that it is more difficult to obtain a sharp image of a still image rather than a moving one, Christianson said he believed it will be nonetheless beneficial to students.SPECTATOR/MICHELLE EHLINGER The summer is nearing its end, which means no more leisurely lunches out on the steps.

66,Art Humanities,"Registering patterns: long lines, aggravation, the works",1 September 1992,"By Elizabeth Berke Spectator Staff WriterSo, you think you've had horrible experiences? Nightmarish days? Terrible weeks? I would venture a rather substantial wager that nothing in your past experience will compare with the upcoming weeks of registra-tion. Every year, the administration comes up with a plan to improve the process. This year, the lines will be shorter, and everything will be organized, and everyone will know exactly where to go, when, and why. They say that every year. Maybe this year they'll be right. The basic process is that you have to sign up forcer-tain classes such as Physical Education, Logic and Rhetoric, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Contemporary Civilization (those in the core curriculum) before you actually register. This process of choosing core curriculum classes is called automated sectioning, and from there it moves on. Registration takes place after classes have begun, enabling students to explore a variety of classes and make an informed decision before they go through the computerized administrative process that commits them to a defined schedule. Those in the know would advise students to get to the lines early in the morning and toward the beginning of the designated time slot in order to avoid the long lines of the last minute rush. Students who are confused about the registration process should turn to their student advisers, who will give them detailed information about how to make sense of the pencil book, the course guide, and the registration process. In addition to students advisers, faculty advisers can be very helpful for students as they choose their course of study. Also, these professorial advisors will provide the needed signature of approval on their registration forms after students have decided upon classes and the double-checked the schedule to make sure there are no time conflicts. From there, only lines await those brave enough to have made it this far. While it may be frustrating and time-consuming and stressful, it is not impossible, and those going through registration for the first time should remember that everyone else has had to go through it at least once before. And you have it easy now. Registration used to be held in the Old Gym, not the Lion's Den of Ferris Booth Hall. Imagine finding the Old Gym during your first week on campus. For one thing, it's underground, and for another thing, there's also a Levien Gym inside the Dodge Physical Fitness Center. And, there's no sign saying ""Old Gym"" on the front of the doors leading to the Old Gym. See, it could be worse. But it'll get better. After automated sectioning, classes start. And then registration, then midterms, then Winter Break, then summer. See it's not that bad. And the best part is, you only have to do it eight times. Good luck."
67,Art Humanities,Get to the core of Columbia,1 September 1992,"By Elliot Regenstein Spectator Designated FlunkyColumbia's Core Curriculum is famous or infamous, depending on who you ask. But it all depends on how you approach it. Treat it well and it will give you a lifetime of pleasure, but treat it poorly and it will kick your butt. There are a few basic facts about life in the Core Curriculum which are absolutely essential; —If your teacher is great, your class will be great; if your teacher stinks, you're in trouble. The curriculum is very strong, but a lame instructor is certainly capable of ruining it. Most instructors are very good, and there are ways to get out of bad situations. With Contemporary Civilization (CC) and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), which are full-year classes, your best bet is to suffer one semester and create a time conflict for the second semester. With Art Humanities (Art Hum) or Music Humanities (Music Hum), which are one semester apiece, you may have to drop the class and start again later. One campus celebrity is rumored to have dropped Music Hum after one week every semester he's been here. —It will be much better for your sanity if you don'tstart comparing your workload to that of your friends in other sections. Some instructors believe that reading 400 pages of deep philosophy every night is the only way to truly experience college; with others, reading the back cover is basically enough. Unless your teacher is an unfair jerk, don't think about it; this is college, and you're supposed to do a lot of work. —Speaking of which, it's really a good idea to do your reading. The books are fantastic, and you can really get a lot out of these classes if you try. Often it's possible to slide by without working too hard. But you'll feel cheated afterwards. Hate to sound like your mom, but it's really true. Obviously, if it's a Friday night and you're choosing between the Village and Voltaire, you'd be a fool to stay cooped up in your room; but if it's Tuesday night and the only thing on TV is ""Ishtar,"" for crying out loud, do your work! Anyway, now that I've completely alienated all of you, here's a quick look at what the Core Curriculum entails: CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION is the heart and soul of the Core. CC dates back to 1919, and incorporates the work of almost every noteworthy dead white male philosopher. In many ways, it'sthe hardest Core class; many elect to take CC sophomore year following Lit Hum, while others dive right into it (and a lunatic few take both at the same time). The typical CC experience will be something like this: you'll do a whopping amount of reading, go to class, discuss the reading with 15 to 20 worn-out classmates who also did the same whopping reading, and then you'll go home to do another whopping reading assignment. There are variations on this theme. For one thing, virtually every section will have: a) someone who always does the reading but never says anything, b) someone who never does the reading but still always has something to say, and c) people who never do the reading and never say anything either. LITERATURE HUMANITIES dates back to 1937, and is patterned after CC, except that instead of philosophy, you'll be reading great works of literature. This makes it somewhat easier than CC, just because the reading is a bit easier (in two years, you'll feel no shame about saying, ""Yeah, I thought Goethe was a good read, but Kant just put me to sleep.""). The major book the two classes have in commonis Plato's ""Republic,"" which is definitely worth reading twice. ART HUMANITIES and MUSIC HUMANITIES are only one semester, but are similar in style; a small class, working its way through the white male history of some cultural genre (art for ArtHum and music for Music Hum, for those of you who weren't paying attention). I say white male history because traditionally, nonwhite males have been poorly represented in the Core. In an attempt to remedy the situation, Columbia has created the Cultures and Issues requirement (formerly known as the Extended Core or Major Cultures requirement). Unfortunately, there's really no way you can learnan appreciation of every culture in four short years; as it is, you barely come to an appreciation of dead white male culture, and that's only one small piece of the puzzle. Those who end up majoring in something like sociology, anthropology, history, or other related areas have a much better chance of taking more than the required number of classes in non-DWM cultures. Those in the hard sciences will probably fulfill their Cultures and Issues requirement, and that will be it. Speaking of science, there is a science requirement, as well as a language requirement, and a PE requirement. How you fulfill these will be up to your personal taste, and you can use any number of criteria to choose how you go about it.For instance, I knew someone who took Italian for his language requirement, simply because it was the only Latin-based language for which the introductory class didn't meet on Fridays. The language requirement, unlike virtually everything else at Columbia, can be placed out of. Those are your basic requirements right there. Obviously, you should read the Bulletin pretty carefully; if you're the kind of person who'd read this far in an article like this, you probably would have done that anyway. The key to your Core Curriculum is, be ready for a lot of work, do that work, and appreciate it. And if you find that the Core Curriculum is not for you, the information number for Brown University is (401) 863-1000."
68,Art Humanities,"$100,000 of Core grant to pay for capital needs",9 November 1992,"By Brett Cohen Contributing WriterThe first $ 100.000 of a $500,000 grant which was given to Columbia College earlier this semester to strengthen the Core Curriculum will be used primarily for capital expenditures. The committee met Nov. 6 to clarify the allocation plans for the Fairchild Foundation grant. University Provost Jonathan Cole applied for the grant when the University did not have sufficient funds for Core Curriculum necessities such as compact disc stations for the Music Humanities department, andprojectors for the Art Humanities department. In the future, committee members plan to shift spending towards curriculum development, but will spend most of the first $100,000 on capital needs such as photocopiers, computers, books, and video tapes. The committee plans to spread expenditures from the three-year grant over five years. Curriculum development will become more of a priority after capital necessities are met, according to Associate Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures Haruo Shirane, who chairs the committee.""We anticipate more curriculum development in the sccond and third year,"" he said. Columbia College Coordinator Eileen Gillooly, a committee member, said she brought her home computer into the Contemporary Civilization/Literature Humanities office because the department needed a computer. Other professors described similar situations in which their departments could not afford computer printers or photocopying machines. ""To be very frank, the grant was absolutely essential for the continuation and maintenance of a high quality core,"" Shiranc said. Because the subject matter of the core courses falls under more than one department, funds for the entire program arc difficult to find.""In a time of financial difficulty, interdepartmental programs lose out,"" Shirane said. Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature James Mirollo, director of the Literature Humanities program and a committee member, said the grant was greatly needed to keep the core in existence. ""'Without this kind of regular infusion of resources, it's difficult to keep the core going. This is what keeps the core alive, instead of it be ing cither starved to death or stagnant."" The future curriculum expenditures. although not finalized, will pay for teacher training, and training for graduate students who intend to teach core courses, Shirane said.Columbia College seniors converged on the steps yesterday afternoon for the annual yearbook portrait."
69,Art Humanities,Marcus and Bynum discuss future,15 September 1993,"By Ronen M. Glimer Spectator Staff WriterDean of Columbia College Steven Marcus and Dean of the School of General Studies Carolyn Bynum informally discussed the Columbia College's role within the University with approximately 40 students last night in the Hartley Hall Library. Marcus, who also holds the position of vice president for Artsand Sciences, gave a brief historical overview of the University's history and Columbia College's changing role since its inception. He described the Columbia College that once stood in the shadows of the renowned graduate schools and graduate programs, as well as the Columbia College of today that occupies a more prominent position. He added that he hopes the school will occupy an even more respected position in the coming years.Mafcus also detailed the agenda he shares with his associates, University President George Rupp, Bynum, and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Eduardo Macagno, for the upcoming year. Most importantly, Marcus said, is the University's effort to shift Columbia College to the center of the Arts and Sciencesconstruct. ""We are committed to the reforming, reshaping, and above all, improving the undergraduate programs,"" Marcus said. The Arts and Sciences construct consists of Columbia College, the School of the Arts, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of General Studies, and the School of International and Public Affairs. Bynum and Marcus spoke frankly with the students about the need to restructure the college's major programs. They also called for student input in letting the administration know what problems exist. ""It's no secret to say, in general, that we feel very proud of what you experience in the first two years of your undergraduate career —that is your Core Curriculum. We feel that there are some problems with the last two years,"" Bynum said.""We need input from you. We need to know what your concerns are. We really are anxious to know what you're interested in having us do,"" she said. Changes in the major system and the Core Curriculum are also being sought out through present experimental curricula in Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Contemporary Civilization. ""If the Core is not strong enough to withstand experimentation, than it is not strong enough at all,"" Marcus said. Currently, the administration is focusing on three capital projects outside the academic sphere. Included are the creation of a visitors center in Low Library and renovations in both Butler Library and Ferris Booth Hall. Marcus and Bynum also cited the need for more seminars, an honors program, and the addition of senior theses to the requirements of certain majors.Most of these topics will be handled by the Committee on Undergraduate Education. Another issue that was of concern to students who attended last night's session was the quality of academic advising in the College. ""This is a big place, an impersonal place. Lots of things are wrong. With a change of a new major system will arise a change in academic advising,"" Bynum said. Students in attendance left with a positive impression of their new deans. ""I really think they seem to be going in a pretty encouraging direction,"" said Chris Heller, CC '96. ""I really hope they follow through with what they said because it will help make Columbia a much more pleasant place,"" she said. Professor of Anthropology Katherine Newman, who serves as Hartley-Wallach's faculty-in-resi-dence, hosted the event.Katherine Newman and Steven Marcus."
70,Art Humanities,USCC calls for a more diverse CORE,2 March 1994,"By MONICA MEHTA Spectator Staff WriterDiscussing the idea that Columbia College's core curriculum excludes non-Western cultures in its reading assignments, a panel ofcampus student leaders addressed about 35 students last night in Ferris Booth Hall (FBH) at a forum sponsored by the United Students of Color Council and the Whitney M. Young Jr. Race and Religious Relations Program. The forum, entitled ""The Core: Campus Leaders Debate Conflicting Perceptions of the Core Curriculum,"" and mediated by USCC Vice Chair Bryonn Bain, CC '95, was held to address the growing concern among students and faculty at Columbia College over the absence of non-European authors, artists, and composers in the four classes comprising the the core curriculum: Contemporary Civilizations, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. Columbia College Student Council (CCSC) President Imara Jones, CC '94, and Dan Morenoff, CC '96, editor of the Opinions secdon ofThe Federalist Paper newspaper, said that the core curriculum's readings should not be drastically altered. Favoring the inclusion of readings from non-Western cultures in the core curriculum, Black Students' Organization (BSO) President Marie Louis, CC '94, Treasurer ofUSCC Omari West, CC'95, and Whitney M. Young Jr. Program Student Coordinator Udit Kondal, CC '94 advocated a change in the curriculum. Former President of the College Democrats Allyson Baker, CC '95, favored a re-examination of the way in which the core is taught, and inclusion of die works of women and texts from other cultures into the curriculum. Panel members who favored reform of the core readings said the curriculum currently centers around Western ideas, and because they do not learn about the literary, artiste, and political traditions of other cultures, students are receiving a limited education. ""The core places the ideas of European thinkers at its center,"" Louis said. ""Everyone else is putin the periphery, as if they had no role in shaping today's society."" Members who disagreed with drastically altering the core's readings said the Western tradition should remain the focus of the core classes because Columbia is an institution which is part of Western culture. Opponents' of the change also emphasized that the core was created to spark critical analysis, not to promote all the ideas in thereadings. ""The core hopes to provide students with an understanding of the dominant Western culture in our society, but we are not attempting to enshrine these authors,"" Morenoff said. Morenoff also said he believed that the core classes should emphasize ideas expressed in the works, rather than their origin. ""The core is not history class,"" Morenoff said. ""We study these people because of their ideas, and ideas have no race."" Louis disagreed, arguing that the core ignores the contributions non-Western thinkers have made to Western thought. ""Why is it that all the people acknowledged to have great ideas in the core come from only one subgroup?"" Louis said. ""The limited foundation the core has attempted to give us is based on a falsification of the facts of history."" Baker and Kondal also disagreed with Morenoff, emphasizing the importance of the origin of ideas. ""I don't think you can understand these great ideas unless you understand their origins and their context,"" Baker said. ""The core curriculum implies that a lot of thought that's worthy of attention started with ancient Greece, and that's Eurocentric,"" Kondal said. ""Many of their ideas were borrowed, if not stolen, from Africa and Asia."" West said the core readings are largely outdated, and limit students' access to new ideas. ""Are we as college students supposed to be constrained to what people in the past think?"" West said. Jones said understanding history was important in understanding the problems in the present. ""You can't understand the present without understanding the past,"" Jones said. ""Ifwe're going to change a patriarchal society, we have to understand patriarchy and the only way we can do that is to study patriarchs."" Other issues brought up in the forum dealt with the absence of works written by and about women and people of different origins in the core classes. BSO Political Chair Sharod Baker, CC '95, thought the forum was productive and informative. ""This made Columbia students look intelligent for once,"" Sharod Baker said. ""In particular, Marie Louis and Imara Jones were very well-versed."" Bain said the forum was only the beginning of the USCC campaign to diversify the core readings, and said a committee will be established to address this issue specifically in the near future."
71,Art Humanities,Editorial Defending the Core,4 March 1994,"Defending the CoreNothing defines Columbia College more than the Core curriculum. For 70 years, students from around the world have gravitated to Morningside Heights to receive the nation's most comprehensive undergraduate education. Contemporary Civilization (CC), the flagship of the Core, along with Literature, Music and Art Humanities, both enrich and unify every student who has earned a Columbia College degree. But after decades of growth, adaptation, and success, CC is now being characterized as a cultural relic which needs restructuring. While the Core faces threats from those who seek to change its basic structure —replacing the small seminars with lecture classes —others demand that the CC syllabus be radically altered. Since its inception, CC has undergone dozens of changes, and yet has maintained a high degree of academic integrity. The course has been able to maintain its relevance through the decades principally because of the flexibility that is built into the curriculum. The structure of the CC department reflects the University's belief that no one person can determine which works contributed to American society. The CC staff meets every two years to analyze how well the course's contents reflect the history of*American thought. Every time it meets, some books are removed, and others are added, but the stringent qualifications for inclusion onto the reading list remain the same. Decisions are based on the books' impact on society, and the power of their messages — which is why certain works and authors have remained on the reading list since the beginning. Further flexibility comes from the fact that individual instructors are allowed to add one or two books to the list for their own classes. Throughout our nation's history, the United States has derived strength from embracing the best traditions of every culture whose descendants have immgrated here. The current curriculum reflects the foundations of American thought; however, the CC staff should consider books that can be added to the syllabus to reflect the ideas of non-European cultures, and their effect on American society. Some legacies deserve the pride and respect of the Columbia community, and the Core is one of them. The books that remain are there because the ideas contained within them have made major contributions to our society. But when other works can be shown to have relevance to the overall Core curriculum, students should have the opportunity to suggest that they be included. The current structure, however, has, can, and will embrace change, and should not be abandoned."
72,Art Humanities,Debating the Core: Whither the west?,18 April 1994,"By MONICA MEHTA Spectator Staff WriterThe Columbia College faculty's March decision to replace the current Cultures and Issues requirement with a MajorCultures requirement that will focus exclusively on non-West-ern cultures is the latest phase of the evolution of the school's Core Curriculum into a program that is more inclusive of traditions and ideas from outside of Europe.Introduced in the wake of World War I, the Core Curriculum was originally meant to give students from different backgrounds experience in reading and interpreting the works that contributed to Western society. Over the years, the Core has expanded to include four required classes —Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), Art Humanities, and Music Humanities —and two semesters of classes which fulfill the current Cultures and Issues requirement. Since CC was first introducedin 1918 and Lit Hum was added in 1937, the Core has moved beyond an almost exclusively Greco-Ro-man emphasis to include more nonEuropean traditions and other historical periods, especially the Middle Ages and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In February, 1988, the Columbia College faculty passed a proposal to create the Cultures and Issues requirement that required students to complete either two semesters of courses dealing with non-European cultures or one nonEuropean cultures course, and one course on contemporary issues. But once instituted, some critics said the requirement, intended to make up for underrepresentation of non-European world areas in the Core, led to a fragmentation of learning instead of a concentrated study of other world cultures. During this academic year, theCC department has introduced a few experimental sections of the class. The experimental sections feature a syllabus that groups works on a thematic, rather than chronological basis, while other sections have expanded the usual syllabus to include more texts —such as the Koran —that have had important influence, but were not traditionally included in the class. Administrators have declined to comment on the experiments until after the classes have been completed next month. Despite the recent experimentation, many students and faculty members believe the Western focus of the Core should not be changed, at least not based on the criticism that the authors may espouse racist or elitist beliefs. Richard Billows, director of CC and an associate professor of history, said that as part of Western culture, Columbia must come to terms with the past before it can deal with the present or future. ""It might be wonderful if in the past people were treated equally, but they were not, and we can't hide that,"" Billows said. Billows also said he believes that the Core should not serve to fragment students into groups on the basis of their racial and ethnic backgrounds, but to unify them under the ideas of Western civilization.""This emphasis on difference, difference, difference, is a disease in modern society,"" Billows said. ""The Core is about understanding and developing a critical engagement with what the key ideas and traditions of Western culture are. There is no plan to make CC anything other than an introduction to Western culture."" The United Students of Color Council (USCC) and the Black Students' Organization (BSO) have been at the forefront of this year's calls to re-examine the Core. At a USCC panel discussion about the Core on March 1, BSO President Marie Louis, CC '94, criticized the absence of texts from the African tradition in the syllabi of CC and Lit Hum. Her complaint, Louis said, is based on the theory that much of the Western tradition has come from the African tradition. USCC Vice-Chair Bryonn Bain, CC '95, also emphasized the concern that although the Core need not represent the diverse student body, Columbia students are not receiving an accurate account of the origins of ideas in the texts. ""I don't think we should change [the Core] merely to duplicate the population at Columbia,"" Bain said. ""But for us to go out into the world and act as agents for change, we have to understand the foundationon which our history was built."" ""We can't do that by saying everything starts with Greece. We need to include classical texts from Asian and African traditions that influenced the Greek thinkers and philosophers,"" he added. School of General Studies (GS) Dean Caroline Bynum said she believed it was important that the Core include non-European works, particularly from the Judaic and Islamic traditions. ""I am happy with the Western emphasis in the Core as long as there is also emphasis on other traditions and as long as the Western texts are questioned in class discussion,"" Bynum said. Although many students feel that the American culture has taken elements from Eastern and Western traditions equally, Billows said Christianity's influence on the U.S. proves that the country derives most of its ideas from the West. ""American culture has developed as a Western tradition,"" said Billows. ""I don't think anyone would deny that fact."" Other students said they believe the Core should remain as it is because it has been a tradition for 75 years. ""I came to Columbia knowing that I would be studying a core of dead white men, and that's what I expected,"" Jimmy Hung, CC '95,said. Bynum and USCC are planning a lecture series entitled ""More on the Core"" next semester, in which guest speakers will offer ""experimental perspectives"" on non-West-ern texts in an attempt to reform the syllabi of the courses. ""They will present books of classical civilization outside the Western canon that have connection to Western civilization,"" Bain said. ""A lot of faculty members and administrators are for a change in the way courses are taught, and we're going to give them the chance to do that,"" USCC Political Chair Marcel Agueros, CC '96, said. Most advocates of Core reform agree that if the Core represents the University's idea of what is essential knowledge for every college student, Columbia is ignoring the rest of the world by excluding nonWestern texts from the course. ""The idea is that you're supposing a total domination of one region's thought and culture,"" Agueros said. Bain agreed, emphasizing the need for Core texts to give students a broad world view. ""We realize that ideas have no race, but the context in which we're learning tells us that any ideas of merit come from only one race,"" Bain said. ""The world is not built upon the ideas of only one race.""Defining diversity Fourth in a 6-part series"
73,Art Humanities,Pointers to plan your first semester classes Finishing the Core early is key to Columbia College,28 August 1995,"Finishing the Core early is key to Columbia CollegeBy MAURICE B. TOUEG Spectator News EditorAny incoming Columbia College student who is not yet familiar with the words ""Core Curriculum"" may want to consider transferring to another, less rigorous institution, perhaps in Philadelphia or Ithaca. As a first-semester Columbian about to choose your first college classes, you should already know that the Core Curriculum will take up much of your time. In fact, the Core will define the structure of your schedule for the next two years, so it's a good idea to think about when you should take your Core classes now. Instead of reading the entire blue course catalog to choose your classes, all you need to read is this article —unless, of course, you don't want to bother thinking about school yet. My first semester I decided to take it easy and get adjusted to college life by taking only four classes. Going out every night was a regular practice and Broadway milkshakes at Tom's Diner were standard fare. Columbia recommends that students take either 15 or 16 points per semester to graduate on time. If you have advanced placement credits, you are in an even better position to take four classes. It is possible to take four classes adding up to 15 points, but you just have to know how to choose those classes. If your name falls in the first half of the alphabet, your first semester as a Columbia College student will be consumed with writing many, many papers for a class called Logic & Rhetoric, or ""L&R."" This class can at first be intimidating, because instructors actually assign homewprk, so my advice is thatif you have to take L&R first semester, do so with only three other classes. If you get lucky and are able to postpone L&R until second semester, fulfill either the language requirement (four points) or part of the science requirement during your first semester. Your second class should either be Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), a year-long survey class in Western literature, or Contemporary Civilization (CC), another staple of the Columbia College Core Curriculum focusing on Western philosophy, religion, and political science. My advice is to take Lit Hum now and save CC for'your sophomore year. Lit Hum is a big reader course so you will need to devote a large chunk of time for the class. My third suggested class is either Art Humanities or Music Humanities, the other main elements of the Core Curriculum. While some students save these classes until their final two years at school, completing one of them in the first semester is not a bad idea. You may even like them, as I did, and decide to take other advanced classes in the future. Your fourth class should be a class for you. If you are dying to take ""Principles of Economics,"" go for it. If you find the ""History of the City of New York"" an interesting topic, have a party, but if you take any advice from this article, don't limit yourself to required classes during your first semester. Do it like Mo and take calculus. And by the way, if you are scrounging for a point, take a gym class. You need two semester's worth to graduate, and the physical education department has about 20 different classes, so get physical and get that last point."
74,Art Humanities,CU bookstore delays anger students,25 September 1995,"By JAY CARSON Contributing WriterThousands of students seeking textbooks for large popular and required classes arrived at the Columbia Bookstore this month only to find empty shelves, as bookstore managers scrambled to correct purchase orders to meet increased demand. But while students and professors are quick to blame the bookstore, problems with the publishers, professors who did not give their orders to the store, and limited access to enrollment numbers affected the store's ability to order books, according to store employees. Similar charges were made of Barnard Bookforum earlier in the month, and Barnard administrators are investigating student and faculty complaints of mismanagement. ""Did we screw up? Yes. A few times, but only on a few titles. The problem this year came from the fact that everything went wrong at once,"" said Cosmo Olivieri, general manager of the Columbia Bookstore, which is operated by Barnes and Noble. As students searched for textbooks, many discovered that the books they needed for class were sold out or missing. Important Core Curriculum books such as the Art Humanities reader and the Contemporary Civilization reader sold out rapidly and stayed sold out for several days at a time,according to students in the classes. ""They would get in small orders and sell out in 20 minutes,"" said Alexa Jeffress, CC '99. Cosmo said one of the bookstore's primary problems was with professors who did not give the bookstore their orders until after classes had begun. ""There is one professor who hasn't phoned in his order in three years and he tells me, 'You should know what I am using,'"" Olivieri said. Olivieri also said that publishers could not handle the overload because bookstores across the country seem to be ordering later and later. Matt Orlowski, CC '99, said he was unable to find his books even after the mangers assured him that the books were ordered. ""There weren't enough books, and book orders always took longer than they said they would,"" Orlowski said. Olivieri said publishers frequently are unable to deliver the books when they promise because of the nation-wide demand for certain items. ""The [publishers] that are not [on time] make us look bad because they promise us a turnaround time, and in turn we promise students a turnaround time and then the publishers do not keep their promise,"" said Olivieri. According to Olivieri another cause for delayswas Columbia's late registration time over Labor Day weekend, and the fact that the bookstore is not notified when class sizes increase significantly in a given year. Additionally, the bookstore's computer link to Columbia's registration numbers was inoperative during the bookpurchasing period. In order to supply the necessary books to students, bookstore employees combed the city's bookstores for more common titles. Olivieri even bought and handdelivered a book to a Law School student. Many students became frustrated when assigned work could not be completed because they did not have the necessary materials.""My teacher was assigning things to do, and I didn't have a book to do the reading,"" Jeffress said. Professors were also frustrated by the shortage of books. ""It seems no one knows what is going on there. Some of the sales assistants aren't very knowledgeable,"" French instructor Kim Hyung said. Other professors had to takeextra measures so that their students had required materials. ""My teacher had to copy pages out of the book so we could keep up,"" said Katie Singer, CC '99. Olivieri said the bookstore will work with the administration and the faculty to create a plan to prevent another similar breakdown next semester.Many students turned to local bookstores after the Columbia Bookstore ran out of required texts earlier this month."
75,Art Humanities,Web projects increase efficiency for services,13 November 1995,"By AMANDA MAY Spectator Staff WriterTo keep pace with student demand for better student services, the University is redoubling its efforts to increase use of the World Wide Web while retaining an acceptable level of security and privacy for the user. According to several University administrators, electronic communication will provide students with improved access to information and enable them to complete certain transactions by computer, eliminating a great deal of University bureaucracy. Vice President for Student Services Mark Burstein said electronic communications eliminate potential human error. ""We're big fans of face-to-face transactions, just not necessarily bureaucratic ones,""said Manager of Academic Information Systems (AcIS) David Millman. ""We're hoping that it will increase face to face transactions with other people."" ""Our goal has been to have electronic information become the primary way students get information,"" said Executive Vice President for Administration Emily Lloyd. ""It's increasingly becoming a 24-hour world, and computers give you information whenever you want it."" In the future, Lloyd said she would like students to have the option to complete today's face-to-face or telephone transactions electronically. Burstein said the revised version of thestudent services home page on the Columbia Web server, which was introduced last week, was designed to cut down on the bureaucratic nature of student services. Information from the new home page can be accessed based on who you are or for what you are looking. ""Students shouldn't see us as how we are organized, but how the services are and how they access them,"" Burstein said. ""It brings students closer to who does what,"" he added Burstein said one of the home page's services, an electronic ""pencil book,"" can provide more up-to-date course information than the traditional printed pencil book. ""[The electronic pencil book] is updated every day, so the changes made that night you can see the very next day,"" Burstein said. ""We want to make sure that students have the best information at their fingertips when they are registering,"" Burstein added. ""But we don't plan on phasing out the [printed] pencil book."" Another service available on the Web is the Health Services home page ""Go Ask Alice,"" which provides students with an easy and confidential way to ask questions regarding drugs, sexuality, and physical health. According to Millman, AcIS is also seeking to put library books on the Web, so students will be able to read a certain book from their rooms without having to go to the library. ""It looks like we'll have [the Contemporary Civilization books] by the spring,"" Millman said, noting that Art Humanities pictures already appear on the Web. Burstein said transactions that are completed in the ""batch"" process, stored up overnight and completed the next day, can be completed electronically. However, ""realtime"" transactions, such as registering for. classes through the computer, are not yet possible. ""So far, our staff doesn't feel comfortable with the security we can provide for real-time transactions,"" Burstein said. ""When our staff feels comfortable, we'll offer it to students."" ""We won't do registration or any other type of administrative service until we know it is secure,"" Millman added. Ensuring the privacy and security of the planned electronic transactions is an administrative priority. ""Right now, the student information sys-tem is set up without the privacy safeguards that you need,"" Lloyd said. ""We want to deliver information, and we want to deliver transactions to students,"" Burstein said. ""But we also want to make sure it is secure."" According to Millman, each service will have a specialized security system. ""There are different ranges of security,"" Millman said. ""For grades, we want to know exactly who you are. With 'Go Ask Alice,' you need a type of security so no one will know who you are."" Both administrators and students noted the increase in use of computer technology in the past few years. ""We have made a lot of progress,"" Lloyd said. ""All the residence halls are now wired for the Web."" Millman added that more people know how to use computers now than in previous years. When the first Columbia Net system appeared in the mid-'Bos, Millman said it was created to be clear and understandable for students with little computer experience. ""We spent a lot of time on training,"" Millman said, adding that people often learn how to use computers if they find them useful. Lloyd said that as more services are introduced, more people will choose to learn how to use them. ""I think people are embarrassed now to say they are afraid of computers,"" Lloyd said. ""Different people find their way in differently."" One of AclS' concerns this year has been to ensure that there is enough access to computers and services, according to Millman. AcIS added between 60 and 80 new Columbia Net terminals this year throughout the University, Millman added. Millman said student demand for Rolmphone and modem access to Columbia Net often exceeds University resources. ""If you call in from outside, a lot of the time the lines are busy,"" Millman said. ""We have to keep up."" According to Millman, the problem has worsened in recent years as more students have used the system. ""The first-year classes arrive knowing more and more every year,"" Millman said. The new residence hall Ethernet connections, which are necessary for access to theWeb, have increased network usage among students, Millman said. Currently, 1,042 residents have connections to the campus Ethernet network in their rooms, and that figure keeps growing, Millman said. Kelvin Cabrera-Castellar, CC '97, connected to the Web this semester and now says he relies on it regularly. ""It is a very, very good convenience,"" he said. ""The future is in the Web."" ""You can basically get any information you want from it right now,"" he added. ""In the future, you probably won't have to leave your home."" Administrators said they are trying to introduce the Web to students with little computer knowledge through the help of Residential Computer Consultants (RCC), who can help install necessary equipment and software. ""We are looking at having residential students trained so you can find someone at11 o'clock at night to solve a problem,"" Lloyd said. Jay Soucy, CC '99, works as an RCC in Schapiro Hall. ""I'm the consultant for Schapiro,"" he said, explaining that his responsibilities include helping students install the Ethernet software and providing assistance with any related problems. ""Ideally, everyone should have it in their room,"" Soucy said. As computer technology advances, administrators and students said they are looking forward to the time when more services are available electronically. ""We're trying to work toward as much as we possibly can to deliver electronically on the transaction side,"" Burstein said. ""My guess is that over the next five years, electronic communication and transactions will really dominate the way we do business,"" Lloyd said. ""But it also takes time and money."""
76,Art Humanities,Graduate students play larger role in CC Faculty interest questioned,27 November 1995,"Faculty interest questionedBy DIANE VADINO Spectator Staff WriterAccording to the Columbia College Bulletin, ""the Core Curriculum is Columbia's signature, its intellectual coat of arms""—and as the first Core class, dating from 1919, Contemporary Civilization, a year-long required class for all Columbia College students, is considered ""one of its most valuable assets."" Today, however, a variety of factors have altered the once-preferred ratios of graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty, with graduate students making up a considerable portion of those teaching CC. According to Director of Contemporary Civilization and Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History J. W. Smit, the teaching responsibilities for CC have traditionally been divided evenly between graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty. However, both Smit and Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis said CC graduate student preceptors now represent a percentage ""somewhere in the mid--405."" Yatrakis said the proportion of graduatestudent preceptors in Literature Humanities classes is closer to the original ratio, and added that the teaching divisions of MusicHumanities and Art Humanities classes, which are staffed by members of the Music and Art History Departments, were never intended to mimic the one-third ratios devised for CC and Lit Hum. Smit said that while he considers thepercentage of graduate student preceptors to be too high, he said he recognizes their justified and traditional place within the CC teaching staff. ""The situation has gotten out of hand now, but I would not like to be without [graduate student preceptors],"" Smit said. ""They really are a very important part of the staff and should remain so, but at the moment, the proportions are wrong."" Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley also defended the role of graduate students teaching CC, noting that the Core Curriculum teaching staff has always included graduate students and that the combination of faculty members and preceptors encourages the exchange of ideas between two teaching generations, as well as -offering graduate students a highly structured environment in which to continue their own training. ""I'm never sure that simple mathematical ratios are a way of deciding an issue,"" Quigley said. ""As long as there's a significant representation of junior faculty, senior faculty, and graduate students, I'm comfortable with it."" Quigley also supported graduate student preceptors against student accusations of sloppiness and inefficiency, saying that the highly supervised nature of CC teaching positions protects against many of the problems resulting from too much independence too early in a graduate student's teaching career.""The objection frequently brought to bear against graduate student teachers is that at some institutions, graduate students are given a free-standing curriculum,"" with the ability to establish the syllabus and grading criteria individually, Quigley said. ""The other objection is that [graduate students at other institutions] are asked to take teaching responsibility very early in their career, as early as their second or third year. In the Core, students are teaching later in their graduate careers, very much at the point where they're just preparing to write a dissertation and go out on the job market—it's just a very different sort of situation than the one that is the target for criticism at other institutions."" According to Smit, the reasons for the number of graduate students teaching CC are based on several factors including faculty reluctance to teach the class, which requires faculty members to be familiar with several different disciplines—including philosophy, history, and political science—unlike Lit Hum, which is based primarily on the study of literature. ""That's the most important reason that [CC] is less attractive to senior faculty to teach than Lit Hum,"" Smit said. ""Philosophers have to deal with history, while historians have to deal with political science. For somebody from [the Middle Fast and Asian Language and Cultures department (MF.ALAC)], none of the texts in CC have anything to do with their training."" ""Somehow in Lit Hum, senior faculty have stayed in rather large quantities. In Lit Hum, people can continue basically to teach their own discipline—once trained in F.nglish literature, it's not a big step to teach classic literature,"" Smit said. ""You don't have to really retool [to teach Lit Hum]; it's a much bigger step for an American historian to be teaching CC, which is all about texts which in his training hardly played a role,"" he added. Yatrakis echoed Smit's thoughts, adding that the far-reaching nature of the class, which covers works from Plato's ""Republic"" to a number of more current works, often intimidates faculty members who are completely comfortable in one discipline. ""We don't expect them to be experts in socio-political thought from ancient times tothe present,"" she added, ""but we do know that they can be intellectual guides for students as they engage these important works and ideas."" Additionally, Smit said faculty members who are recruited as senior professors are especially reluctant to teach a broad-based course such as CC. And while assistant professors receive a semester off after teaching the class for three years, senior faculty ""don't get anything special for it,"" Smit said. ""People who don't have the CC tradition behind them basically avoid teaching it,"" Smit said. ""Departments have a habit of hiring people to cover certain specialties, and a well-known specialist hired as a senior professor generally doesn't like to give up time doing his own stuff for doing something outside his discipline."" Another reason Smit pointed to in explaining the disproportionate number of graduate students teaching the course is the decreasing size of the faculty and a need for individual departments to retain their own teaching staffs. ""Faculties are still shrinking, and the understandable complaint of departments is that they cannot cover the classes in their department,"" Smit said. ""When I teach CC, I can't teach a seminar or lecture in my own discipline, and a department does not like to lose 50 percent of its teachers to courses outside the department. I don't think at this moment in time of shrinking faculties, [department] chairmen can continue to give more regular faculty to the Core program."" Smit said the possibility of a larger Columbia College class size, currently being examined by the provost's office, could irreparably damage the nature of the class and result in less effective teaching. More CC sections would be necessary to accommodate the extra students, Smit said, and as a result, graduate students who, in the past, would have been turned down for a teaching position, would now be accepted. ""On one hand the faculty is shrinking, and on the other hand, you have the increased size of the College, which means you need more sections of Lit Hum, CC, and the other Core classes,"" Smit said. ""It's really a contradictory policy."" Smit also noted that the changing natureof several disciplines, which had in the past contributed faculty members to CC, resulted in a situation where entire departments no longer contribute instructors to CC. ""Certain departments [such as economics and anthropology] have totally dropped out of teaching CC,"" Smit said. ""In econ, the reason's that difficult—economics has become more and more a mathematical science, while before it had been a social science with a very strong humanities aspect. All these things are changing back, but we have not yet seen the departments return to CC,"" he added. Several Core administrators emphasized that although graduate students comprise a higher proportion of the teaching staff than originally intended, graduate students have always represented a part of the teaching staff. The extensive training they receive, Smit said, as well as their enthusiasm for teaching, can in some cases render them preferable to a tenured faculty member who has grown tired of the subject, while Yatrakis noted that one of the University's most acclaimed professors, Lionel Trilling, taught CC as an instructor before becoming a full faculty member. To prepare graduate students for teaching CC, Smit said, the selected students go through an extensive training process and participate in staff meetings throughout their tenure as preceptors. According to Smit, those chosen to teach CC sections are gradually subjected to a substantive training process, which includes exposure to a CC class prior to their teaching appointment, additional meeting time for first-year preceptors, and attendance at a weekly staff meeting, at which all CC teachers gather together to discuss the upcoming works. James Steintrager, who is finishing his dissertation in comparative literature, is teaching a CC section for the first time this year. ""One of the biggest problems is that no one can be an expert on all the material in this class,"" Steintrager said. ""We have to know more than just what we're reading, [such as] an idea of how Plato's ""Republic"" fits in with all of Plato's work. In some ways, the training is always going to be inadequate because CC, as opposed to Lit Hum, is nevergoing to be standardized. Not only do you have to make some difficult choices witli the reading [selections], there's many more choices with which themes you want to focus on."" According to Steintrager, preceptors are motivated to dedicate considerable amounts of energy and work developing the class, if only to put to rest undergraduate students' concerns that their status as graduate students diminishes their teaching. ""I always have this fear in the back of my mind,"" Steintrager said. ""Students expect you to be a little more humane, but on the other hand, they do tend to be a little bit more critical of what your credentials are for teaching. You may find that grad students overcompensate for this, something which could really add to the course. Grad students aren't resting on their laurels, because they really don't have any."" Steintrager said he disagrees with the idea that faculty-led classes are inherently more successful than those led by graduate students. ""Ultimately, I don't know how well that holds up,"" Steintrager said. ""Teaching CC requires more energy and time commitment than it does expertise in a given field."" Although one student who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he has had positive experiences with graduate students teaching his other Core classes, his experience with a graduate student teaching CC has been considerably less fulfilling. ""I feel like I'm being robbed educationally because my grad student CC professor is such a disorganized teacher. Although he himself knows the material reasonably well, he has little pedagogical skills,"" said the student. ""I've given him plenty of chances, yet every time I feel that he's failed at effectively handling a text or conveying an idea."" The student also said the experience has affected his perception of graduate student teachers in general and would influence who he selected to teach his CC class in the spring. ""After over a year here, I feel I have no contact with any professors as well as no academic direction,"" he said. ""Next semester I'm choosing a section on behalf of the status of the professor that's teaching it,""the student added."
77,Art Humanities,Study plans for growth of Columbia College Feasability study's details include possible closure of River Hall,5 February 1996,"Feasability study's details include possible closure of River HallBy KIM VAN DUZER Spectator Staff WriterMajor changes affecting the undergraduate community —including plans to close River Hall, the construction of a new 420-bed residence hall, and the creation of an additional 42 sections of Core classes —comprise the finer points of the long-awaited written report on the University's proposed plans to expand Columbia College. The report, entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia,"" described River Hall as ""a poor quality facility that probably does not merit further capital investments,"" and said the closing of River, along with the construction of a new residence hall at the proposed 113 th Street and Broadwaysite and an $8 million renovation project for Wien and Woodbridge Halls, ""will result in a significant improvement in the quality of Columbia's undergraduate residence halls."" According to the report, the renovation projects and the construction of a new student center to replace Ferris Booth Hail (FBH) are two principal initiatives that will be financed in part by the increased revenue resulting from an increase in Columbia College enrollment. In its analysis of the effects of increased enrollment on class size, the report concluded that fixed-enrollment Core classes—including Literature Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, andLogic and Rhetoric classes—would require the greatest increase in number of sections with 42, while courses such as languages, labs and seminars would only require a few additional sections to accommodate increased enrollment. According to the report, the additional sections of Core courses will be taught by a mix of junior faculty and graduate student preceptors. University Provost Jonathan Cole stressed that there would be no increase in the maximum size of Core classes, andsaid an effort would be made to maintain a ratio of onethird senior faculty, one-third junior faculty and one-third graduate students teaching Core classes, though the report does not mention the addition of senior faculty members to accommodate an increase. ""We may have to have senior faculty teaching more than one section of certain Core courses, but we will try to maintain that ratio,"" Cole said. According to the report, a 15percent increase in enrollment will ' have less of an effect on lecture courses in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, though the report projects that the social sciences, which currently have the highest average enrollment per class with 50, would experience the largest increase in average class size. Cole pointed out that in 1994-95, the majority of classes had enrollments of less than 29 students, and only four percent of classes had 100 or more students. ""There is a common misperception that most of our classes arc ifiese large lecture classes, but in reality we have an overwhelming number of small classes,"" Cole said. Cole noted, however, that within more popular majors such as English, history and economics, and within smaller majors such as German and classics, these distributions vary greatly. In evaluating the effects of increased enrollment on centrallymanaged services such as financial and academic computing services,the report created a ""place-holder"" cost of $933 per student to account for the possible expansion of such services that the increased enrollment may necessitate. According to the report, however, ""it is likely that very few administrative units will need any additional resources to accommodate 530 additional students over the current University-wide student enrollment of roughly 20,000."" Many of the goals for enhancing the quality of undergraduate life outlined in the report arc an outgrowth of the results of the annual Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) Senior Survey in which outgoing students rate their satisfaction with Columbia in areas such as academic advising, administration responsiveness, food services, sense of community, climate for minorities, and ethnic/racial diversity. In the past, student responses to the areas covered in the survey ranged from ""generally dissatisfied"" to ""very dissatisfied"" in almost everyarea. Climate for minorities and ethnic/racial diversity on campus were the only two areas with which students said they were ""generally satisfied"" with Columbia. The survey, which also compared Columbia's results to those of six other research universities, including Harvard University, Yale University, Dartmouth College, and Georgetown University, found Columbia student satisfaction well below the median and often on the low end of student satisfaction at other schools. According to the report, plans for renovations of existing residence halls, the construction of a new residence hall, and the construction of the new student center will improve Columbia's performance in many of the areas covered by the survey and also increase Columbia's rate of student satisfaction. In examining the potential increase in revenue that would result from a 15 percent increase in the size of Columbia College, the report projects that an additional $l3-1 million per year will be brought in by the academic year 2007-08. According to the report, approximately half of the increased revenues will be used to cover ""variablecosts,"" which include financial aid, housing expansion, administrative support, and instructional and academic support costs. ""Academic enhancements,"" which involve improvements in the academic departments of the arts and sciences, will receive approximately one-third ofthe additional revenues. According to Cole, ""academic enhancements"" could entail hiring new faculty members, maintaining faculty quality through raises for faculty members, and possibly adding classes in new areas of study such as Latino Studies. The remainder of the increased revenues will be targeted for ""student quality enhancements,"" which relate to the new student center and the renovations of Wien and Woodbridge. Cole said his administration will be consulting with the University Trustees on the series of proposed actions in the report, though the proposal will not be formally voted on by the Trustees. Member of the Student Committee for the Future of Columbia Avi Green, CC '96, said an increase in enrollment will make achieving the goal of a more cohesive University community impossible. ""There is absolutely no argument that a larger class size brings any good in and of itself except for more money,"" Green said. ""There is no question that there is a sense at Columbia that the community is fragmented, and it is only going to get worse with an increase."" Green also said he was concerned that the increased revenue would not necessarily all go back to Columbia College. ""All the money made from an increase should be spent on the College,"" Green said, ""and I don't see any guarantee of that.""Advocates of ethnic studies programs spoke last night at a Columbia College Student Council meeting."
78,Art Humanities,Faculty react to planned increase Professors divided over effects of increase in Columbia College,19 February 1996,"Professors divided over effects of increase in Columbia CollegeBy ADRIENNE CARTER Spectator Staff WriterThe debate over the proposed increase in the size of Columbia College is being waged throughout all segments of the University, from students to administrators to staff members. One of the groups that will be most affected by the planned additions is the faculty—many of whom were divided on the ramifications of the increase. According to the report, entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia,"" University administrators have proposed increasing the size of Columbia College from 3,500 students to approximately 4,000 by 2002. Assistant Director of AfricanAmerican Studies Curtis Stokes said the increase will negatively affectthe undergraduate experience at Columbia College and in the end, students will feel the greatest consequences. ""I am disturbed because my understanding is that Columbia College is committed to academic excellence and implicit in academic excellence is the idea that students should be a priority. That is undermined when the size of the class is significantly increased,"" Stokes said. ""One has to certainly, as an instructor, be concerned about what the future holds for the students."" However, Chair of the Physics Department Professor of Physics Norman Christ said he is enthusiastic about the prospects of the increase, saying it will allow the physics department to do more in way of scientific research. ""I think most of the science department, certainly physics is small compared to other departments at competing universities. Anything that goes in the direction of going larger is of benefit to the University,"" Christ said. ""In general, it's better to get bigger than smaller."" The report concluded that in order to maintain the size of lim-ited-enrollment Core classes —including Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Logic and Rhetoric classes—an additional 42 sections would be necessary. According to the report, lecturecourses in the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities will be the least affected by the increase because of the high registration already in those classes. However, there will be some increases to various classes, but the affect of this increase varies, according to Columbia College faculty members. Chair of the Anthropology Department Alexander Alland Jr. said the anthropology department will not feel the effects of an increase in the class size. ""I don't think it will affect the [anthropology department]. Our classes have always ranged from small to large depending on the entry level,"" Alland said. Chair of the Sociology Department Mary Ruggie said the increase in the number of students will affect classes in different ways. For instance, she said, with larger classes that have over 75 people the effect will be great if there aren't enough discussion sections. ""We already have a couple of classes that are really large. If you can't have extra discussion classes, they won't have'as good of an experience,"" Ruggie said. ""When [the classes] get to be too big, there isn't as much discussion."" However, she said, classes with only 50 people will not be affected as much ""if there are just.minimal increases. Chair of the Religion Department Wayne Proudfoot said classes in the religion department are already too large and the size increase will only add to the problem. ""Some of our classes are too large already because of the Major Cultures requirement,"" Proudfoot said„ With the increase in class size for Columbia College and the possible effect on various courses, faculty members agreed that additional resources in most departments will be necessary to facilitatethe increase. However, professors were split over whether or not the administration will parallel the increase in students with an increase in resources. Higgins Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Chemistry Department George Flynn said the administration has proposed an increase in labs as well as teaching assistants in order to deal with an increased students load in the chemistry department. ""The incremental costs have been calculated quite well,"" Flynn said. ""Nobody is trying to pull a fast one with regards to budgetary calculations."" Similarly, Alland said his department will be able to handle an increase because there were already plans in motion to hire new faculty members before the announcement. ""We're recruiting faculty. [The increase in faculty] depends on who we get, but it's a very significant number,"" Alland said. ""We're hoping to have these people in place by next year."" Christ said he believes added resources—such as labs and discussion sections —are needed, but the current faculty will be able to handle extra students. ""I think there is enough flexibil-ity [in the physics faculty] that we can deal with a 10 percent increase [in students] without too much increase in faculty,"" Christ said. However, Proudfoot said he was unsure of whether there will be sufficient support systems to handle the extra students. ""It can't be done without the resources,"" Proudfoot said. ""The report from the administration says resources will be made available, but it's not really quite clear [what those resources will be] right now."" Proudfoot added that hiring additional teaching assistants is especially crucial in light of the new proposal. ""It's very hard to teach it in the proper way if we don't have enough teaching assistants,"" Proudfoot said. Ruggie is similarly unsure if the current resources are enough to deal with the extra students ""What we would like to do is have more discussion sections,"" Ruggie said. Ruggie also said an increase in professors would help make the students' experience in the sociology department a better one. ""We wish there were going be more professors; we're just not sure that's going to happen,"" Ruggie said."
79,Art Humanities,"Cole, Quigley, and Cohen present plan Cole says plans to close River Hall are now 'off-line'",28 February 1996,"Cole says plans to close River Hall are now 'off-line'By ADRIENNE CARTER Spectator Staff WriterWith only a month a half until Columbia College admissions officials mail out acceptance letters, University administrators say the size of the Class of 2000 has yet to be determined, as the debate over class size continues among students, administrators, faculty, and staff members within the University. University Provost Jonathan Cole released a letter to the faculty on Monday addressing numerous issues and questions that have been ""raised repeatedly"" over the course of the class size debate. Cole, Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley, and Vice President for Arts and Science David Cohen also addressed various concerns at a presentation to an audience of approximately 10 students. In the original report entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia"" released by the University at the end of January, administrators proposed a 15 percent increase in class size—a total of 530 additional students—by the year 2000. The report also called for the closing of River Hall, the construction of a new 420-bed residence hall, and the creation of 42 new sections of limited enrollment Core classes such as Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Logic and Rhetoric. However, after the concerns offaculty members, students, and alumni became evident in committee meetings, town meetings, and other venues, the administration, according to the faculty letter, has ""learned a great deal and have also been able to articulate more fully the benefits and risks associated"" with the proposed class size increase. One of the main concerns of the student body voiced in various meetings has been the closing of RiverHall. River, which was originally slated to be closed down because it was, according to the original report, ""a poor quality facility that probably does not merit further capital investments,"" was the subject of a study conducted by engineers that was influential in determining the status of the residence hall last year. However, in the Monday meeting with students Cole said plans to take River Hall ""offline"" are being reconsidered. ""We're now going to take another look,"" Cole said. This change is due in large part, Cole said, to the reaction of the students. According to Cole, plans are in the works for another engineering study as well as a look intohow River's closing will affect the ""sense of community."" ""Although cost will be an important factor in the University's ultimate decision regarding River —including the opportunity cost of not being able to undertake improvements in other buildings—students' sentiments regarding this facility will also be fully heard and taken into account,"" Cole said in the letter to the faculty. Students and faculty were also concerned about the effects the proposed increase would have on the Core classes and instruction in various departments. While the University still plans to add 42 section of the limited enrollment Core classes, Cole said the administration has taken the necessary steps to add an additional eight instructors who will be responsible in part forteaching some core classes. Similarly, Cohen said the University ""has been moving forward""in adding more faculty to the departments in which the largest number of students major. According to Cohen, the economics department is in the process of getting five new senior hires, while the political science department hopes to bring in four new professors, and the department of English and comparative literature has been given authorization to start recruiting new faculty, Cohen said. Cohen also said the University will ""begin to manage faculty hiring,"" which would include making more professors responsible for teaching in the Core, a practice which, he added, the University has moved away from in recent years. The issue of the new residence hall was also addressed in both the faculty letter and the panel discussion. According to the letter, the decision to build a 420-bed residence hall has not yet been finalized. The decision, ""that needs to be made over the next several years,"" is contingent on two factors—""whether there are sufficient gift funds to carry out the project and whether [the University is] confident that [administrators] will proceed to the full 15 percent enlargement,"" Cole said in the letter. Even if the University decides to go ahead with the construction and then stops expanding Columbia College, Cole said in the letter, they will ""sell"" the extra beds to the School of Engineering and Applied Science or to Bar-nard. ""In the event that neither of these schools [are] interested in 'purchasing' undergraduate residence space, [the University can] transform a number of small off-campus residences nowused for undergraduates to graduate students housing,"" Cole said in the letter. Quigley similarly addressed how he hopes the plan will ""promote the further development of the house system,"" as well as foster a sense of community within the University. Quigley said that in order to further thr house system it is necessary to have a different center of social interaction. ""We would want to focus less on the dining hall and more on lounges,"" Quigley said. Quigley said the creation of social events that ""bridge"" various groups within the community including faculty and alumni are also included in the plan to increase the sense of community. For instance, Quigley said, he hopes Colum bia College administrators can make use of the ""strong alumni base"" as well as encourage students' activities in New York City. According to Cole, the Monday meeting which addressed various student and facultx concerns, is most likely the last formal meeting with students ""I don't think we'll have another meeting before we actually have to make a decision about the incoming class,"" Cole said. However, Cole urged students to continuing addressing their concerns to both the administration and student leaders.31/ur rriu 1 uviiwrntn —LX/UI mmAjrr University Provost Jonathan Cole addressed the concerns of several students at a meeting focusing on the effects of a proposed 15 percent increase in the size of Columbia College."
80,Art Humanities,SPECTATOR PERSPECTIVES Professors say teaching should remain a priority Lectures and seminars provide different classroom experiences,27 March 1996,"Professors say teaching should remain a priorityLectures and seminars provide different classroom experiencesBy SANDRA P. ANGULO Spectator Staff WriterAlthough Columbia is not among the five Ivy League schools in the annual U.S. News and World Report listing of the top 24 schools ranked for effectiveness of undergraduate teaching [""America's Best Colleges"", Sept. 18, 1995], there are many professors who would argue that Columbia's dedication to undergraduates is evident in its commitment to maintaining the Core Curriculum and offering a variety of departmental and interdisciplinary seminars. Faculty members claim they are often unintentionally omitted from debates about expanding the class size, decreasing the number of faculty members, and overcrowding in Core classes, which have focused on the student or administrative perspective. Professors, many of whom serve on committees that help analyze and formulate University policies that affect student life, are more aware of important issues and more dedicated to the cause of bettering undergraduate education than a ranking in U.S .News and World Report can indicate. The Importance of Maintaining the Core Six professors in different fields of study unanimously asserted their belief in the benefits of teaching Core classes and mentioned the necessity of retaining strict limits on the number of students within Core sections.. Director of Contemporary Civilization Wim Smit, who has taught at Columbia for more than 30 years, said the Core is inextricable from Columbia's reputation for excellence. ""The Core is basically an education in reading and thinking about the most importantsocial issues and cultural concepts in our history,"" Smit, who has taught Contemporary Civilization, as well as Art and Music Humanities, said. ""Contemporary Civilization, for example, is not a disciplinary course but one in which the teachers as well as the students learn the basic problems and developments of social life and try to understand them through discussion."" Professor of History Marcia Wright, who also teaches Contemporary Civilization, said Core classes provide a unique opportunity for familiarity and in-depth discussion. ""While teaching the Core you can expect people to read the material and come to class prepared to discuss it,"" she said. ""It's quite a distinction from teaching a lecture in which the students don't usually speak."" While these professors enjoy teaching their respective Core classes, Smit recognized that fewer professors offer to teach the Core due to both the increasing number of professors who are on sabbatical each year and overwhelming time constraints that result from teaching in individual departments. ""In the 30 years since I've been here, the teacher-to-student ratio has become less favorable, in Core classes especially, where there are fewer professors than there used to be,"" he said. v- Hilary Ballon, Professor of Art History and Art Humanities, said that despite Columbia's low ranking in U.S. News and World Report, she considers the Core Curriculum to be an indication that undergraduate teaching is a significant issue at Columbia. ""I regard Columbia as an environment where undergraduate teaching is taken very seriously, and the Core Curriculum testifies to that,"" she said.Despite Columbia's notoriety as the smallest Ivy League school, it is common for an undergraduate to sit in at least one or two lecture courses a semester with as many as 150 to 200 other students. Professors of Columbia's larger introductory and most popular lecture courses must sometimes resort to turning students away or petitioning for an accommodating classroom. For every seemingly overcrowded lecture, however, there are also an adequate number of seminar courses that departments usually offer to juniors and seniors. All of the professors interviewed recognized the distinction between teaching behind a lectern in a classroom with over 100 students, and sitting at a table with six to 12 students in a seminar, but none of them claimed to prefer one to the other. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Franco Moretti taught at Italian universities for 19 years before moving to New York six years ago. Since then, his lecture in 20th Century Fiction has attracted more than 150 students each fall. Moretti said preparing for a lecture is an exercise in organization. ""Since I have to prepare in English, which is my second language, I have to prepare more carefully,"" he said. ""Since I don't master all of the nuances of the language, lectures get more black and white and extra clarity is inevitable."" Professor of Anthropology Terence D'Altroy, who began teaching at Columbia 14 years ago, also teaches over 150 undergraduates in his introductory course Rise of the Civilization, but heads a seminar in archeology with only 10 students. D'Altroy noted that the biggest difference between teaching a seminar and a large lecture is the requirement of student participation. ""Most students don't do all of the assignments for a lecture course —that's standard —and because of that, the upper division seminars cause students to think more than in the lower division lectures,"" D'Altroy said. ""You don't have room to deal with ambivalence in large lectures, which are more straightforward."" Like D'Altroy and Moretti, Donald Hood, Professor of Neuropsychology, teaches to more than 160 students each fall, but he also holds a 10-student seminar in his apartment called Mind and Brain, which he co-teaches with his wife, who is a neurosurgeon. ""Clearly we can't teach all of our courses to 10 students, and there is a certain order to first teaching the vocabulary of a field and then to do something more in-depth in an advanced course,"" Hood said. Moretti stressed how conciseness and spontaneity are necessary to teaching an undergraduate lecture. ""Clarity is the quality of enlightenment; if a professor is clear he establishes an equality with his students,"" he said. ""If you're not clear people can't disagree with you, which is very cozy, but it's a coziness at the expense of lack of intelligence."" On the other side of the teaching spectrum are professors who continually teach small lectures and seminars, partly because the nature of their courses is more specialized than popular introductory or survey courses. Professor of History Marcia Wright, who specializes in African History, has never taught a class to more than 50 students in her 30 years at Columbia. ""I think it is a lot better for a student to have an instructor who reads and grades all of their work instead of having it graded by a teaching assistant,"" she said. ""I don't condemn big classes, but there is something to be said for having an instructor who knows you."" Similarly, Smit teaches lecture classes to an average of 30 students and seminar classes to six or seven students. ""I've never done or taught a survey lecture course; I would hate to give one of thoselectures which are a series of informational facts,"" he said. ""Even a seminar with more than 10 students makes it much more difficult to concentrate on the issues at hand; I like a seminar in which no one is silent."" Changing Times at Columbia One of the questions that tenured professors are more qualified to answer is how undergraduates' attitudes and perceptions have changed throughout their teaching careers. Smit, who began teaching in 1965, said students are much less politically aware than they used to be in the '6os. ""I came here during a rather turbulent time when there was an active political community both on the left and the right, not just the students involved in the 'Columbia revolution,' but also their opponents,"" he said. ""In the late '7os, that began to disappear, and now I find that the majority of students are apolitical and not interested in taking a stand."" Wright agreed with Smit and said this generation of undergraduates is more cautious than the one preceding it. ""Different temperaments seem to rule at different times; this generation is very careful and has lost a whole sense of political alterna-tives that were alive and relished by the generation of the late '6os and early 705,"" Wright said. However, Hood, who began teaching at Columbia in 1969, said that, fundamentally, undergraduates students haven't stopped being politically involved. ""The number of students helping the homeless or taking a year after college to work in the public services hasn't changed,"" Hood said. ""Only the way you see mobilization on campus changes, but that is a sign of the environment in which 20-year-olds are put, not a sign of change in the 20-year-olds."" Undergraduate and Graduate Students The cross-section of professors interviewed said undergraduate teaching is a more exhilarating experience than graduate teaching, because undergraduates tend to ask more provocative questions, challenge the professor's assertions, and force the professor to offer stimulating material. Hood said it was the biggest surprise of his career to enjoy undergraduate teaching more than graduate teaching. ""I find it more enjoyable to teach undergrads because they are more open to being wrong,"" he said. ""Once people enter grad school theybecome young professionals really fast, which restricts their possibilities."" Ballon said her experience with undergraduates demonstrates how fulfilling it is to be a professor. ""It is said for every exciting discussion in an undergraduate seminar there is a graduate seminar that is stiff and more silent, because the expectations change radically,"" she said. ""Undergraduates have a much bolder approach to their educations."" The Faculty's Vision for the Future When asked about the validity of Columbia administrators' proposal to increase the class size, more than half of the professors expressed their concern that faculty resources would not increase as the number of students increases. Some of the problems highlighted by faculty members include the decrease of faculty hires in the past 10 years, the lack of adequate classroom space, and, most notably, the need to add extra Core Curriculum sections to accommodate the extra students. ""I think any kind of increase in enrollment would make it difficult to continue what I call the real Columbia education,"" Smit said. ""The Columbia education is one in which"
81,Art Humanities,Ethnic studies advocates take over Low 125 people still occupying Low Library Rotunda this morning,10 April 1996,"125 people still occupying Low Library Rotunda this morningBy SPECTATOR STAFFAs of 4:30 this morning, 100 demonstrators demanding the creation of an ethnic studies department continued to occupy Low Library. The demonstrators stormed Low Rotunda yesterday afternoon following a planned ""mass rally"" held at the Sundial at 4:00 p.m. Throughout the afternoon and into the evening, a seesawing standoff evolved between ethnic studies advocates—who insisted upon immediate action in response to their demands —and administrators. Protesters —resisting threats of arrest, expulsion, and other disciplinary action —repeatedly refused to give up what they considered to be their primary bargaining tool: a large numerical presence in the Rotunda. The takeover led to a meeting with administrators, a support rally of 100 additional protesters held outside the guarded doors of Low, and a scuffle between protesters and security. One student, who suffered an asthma attack during the shoving match, was rushed by Columbia Area Volunteer Ambulance (CAVA) to St. Luke's hospital. Security then retreated from the second floor of Low and protesters were left in control of the building, where they remain.The events of yesterday transpired as follows: 4:00 p.m. rally The protest began at the Sundial, where ethnic studies supporter Elbert Garcia, CC '97, told the nearly 200 demonstrators in attendance to move the protest to the Low Library steps ""in order to get a better view of things."" On Low Steps, Garcia addressed supporters with a message of frustration with University President George Rupp for not mentioning the hunger strikers in his letter to Jane Bai, aday 10doctoral candidate in the School of Arts and Sciences and a member of Committee on Ethnic Studies.Rupp issued a letter addressed to Bai stating that the administration has no plans to create an ethnic studies department. ""[Rupp] did not admit that his students are in a hunger strike,"" Garcia said, ""Does the University care? If the University truly cared, they would address the issues."" Garcia also outlined his goal for the rally. ""We are here so we can move forward as an academic community with more programs of knowledge,"" Garcia said. Following this speech, a representative from the Student Committee to Support Barnard Local 2110 spoke about a link between her causeand the ethnic study cause. ""There will be a strike at Barnard tomorrow. Most of the people on 2110 are black and Latino. We need to link up those movements,"" Sasha Cagen, BC '96, said. The President of the City College Graduate Student Council, DavidSuker, spoke next in support of creating an ethnic studies department at Columbia. ""A program without a departmentain't shit,"" Suker said. 4:20 p.m. takeover Following Suker's presentation, Garcia led a march from the Low Steps to the building's southeast entrance, located on the first floor. Three security guards protected the main entrance of Low during the protest, but only one was guarding the southeast entrance. Protesters knocked aside the security guard, who tried to shut the door from the inside, and stormed into the building, climbed the steps to the second floor, and seated themselves in Low Rotunda."

The event was scheduled to occur this morning and was to be viewed by students in classrooms in Harlem and Virginia. The presentation includes a computerized tour of Amiens Cathedral, which Murray hopes will enhance the visual experience of Art Humanities classes at Columbia. Murray added that one of the first application of the presentation's technology may be a computerized display of African Art. The occupation of the Rotunda by protesters may force Murray to postpone his lecture. ""It's not in [the protester's] interest to block the event. We're both trying to expand what Columbia does.

83,Art Humanities,NETSPACE VOILA AMIENS!,26 September 1996,"VOILA AMIENS!By KEITH HAYSWhen it comes to cathedrals, there are some that stand out above the rest: Notre Dame, Chartres, Rheims, and of course, Amiens. Few buildings equal the grandeur and architectural intricacy that a cathedral possesses. As centers of worship, Gregorian chants echo between buttresses, the penitent cross the divinely adorned portals for redemption, and heaven radiates from every stone and stylus. These colossal churches symbolize the ultimate construction for the Almighty. Though the religious values imparted in these cavernous structures have changed through reformation and dissolution, the cathedral remains unmoved. It will forever be preserved as well, as Columbia's Media Center for Art History has devoted itself to immortalizing Amiens Cathedral on the Internet, and the results have been nearly as monumental as the building itself. Spearheaded by Professor of Art History and Archaeology Stephen Murray and executive producer Maurice Luker, the multi-faceted media tool offers an authoritative information source on this landmark and further establishes the Internet as a valuable tool of educational value and historical preservation. The site's development began in 1994, when it started as a computer graphics animated film. The general goals were broad from the beginning, taking on as many angles of the cathedral as possible, from both land and air, interior and exterior. When the Media Center first received funding, it was intended for a Core Curriculum project, and Mr. Luker found ""architecture is one of theharder concepts to grasp"" for students and requires special visual tools. The World Wide Web provides such a utility. The complex nature of a cathedral must break down simply on the Internet to create a sense of orientation for the distant Web user. Therefore, upon entering the digital portal of Amiens, the page splits itself into frames with useful instructions to embark on a virtual exploration of architectural splendor that is easily navigable. Nearly every inch of Amiens Cathedral shines across the project's screens. Netizensmay view hundreds of images at the site, from computer graphics to charcoal sketches. Producer Maurice Luker said ""we are most proud of the ease of navigation with the images,"" and these visuals truly are fantastic. The. computer graphic images create the three-dimensional perspective that eludes conventional photography. This depth of field in the image gallery dissects the structure down to its fundamental skeleton of beams and buttresses, and tracks the addition of essential components to make the building as eternally sound as possible. The finished product presents itself in the photographic collection. Some photographs were shot especially for the Web, while others were pooled from Professor Stephen Murray's own collection. An omnipresent camera captured every breathtaking portal and path of the finished product. One can peer down at the church from aerial pictures, or follow the contours of each sculpture extending skyward from below. These images dynamically flash before beholders in quicktime movies as well. The viewer can zoom over the town'srooftops in a sweeping approach to the awesome monument standing in a cloudy mist above the placid town's rooftops, all in about 15 seconds of colorful, resolute frames. In addition to aesthetic appeal, the Media Center strives to place the edifice in a historical context. Murray meticulously addresses the important religious and historical aspects of the architecture. A large collection of text documents elaborates on the cultural issues and the church's condition for construction. The site's files chronicle each phase of building, including tragedies or political eventswhich affected the work, such as Amiens' destruction over World War I. Amiens stands out because of its elaborate sculptural program. This program unfolds with detailed descriptions of the portal's designs and biblical influences, and spatial calculations are broken down in the original architect's formula plus measurements from famous Gothic restorer Viollet-le-Duc. To round off the factually packed location, anything unanswered may be addressed through the discussiongroup attached to the page, with viewable questions and answers, as well as areas to provide feedback. Of particular interest for non-art majors are the interactive portions of the site that any tourist can enjoy. One can choose the guided tour, or make use of green and pink buttons and bars to maneuver around the structure. When nearing a sculpture, sound buttons appear that play the sculpture's ""voice"" when pressed, an added touch by Web tech-nician-David Ruy. The site's frames allow users to sidestep some pictures and focus on particular portions of the architectural scheme. An interactive photographic tour of the cathedral's interior is also being developed. Users will find an uncommon freedom to explore the pages and appreciate this Gothic relic . Executive Producer Luker feels the Media Center is quite pleased with the project so far gaining educational and public recognition. The digital architecture was featured in the Frankfurt Times, as well as Spanish and German television programs. Educationally, Luker said Amiens Cathedral on-line hasfunctioned as a focal point for cross-discipli-nary education. At the secondary school level, French teachers use the site's bilingual text documents for translation exercises. Geology departments say the significant topography surrounding Amiens makes the site worthy of study. At Columbia, art humanities students are urged to view the pages to supplement classroom slides. Thus Murray makes his publishings accessible to wider audiences through use of new media. Both for educational and entertainment value, the project does justice to its overwhelming subject matter. Pushing technology to its limits renders an impressive history from the cathedral's inception in 1220 until today. No postcard, Art Hum slide, or Monet painting quite captures Amiens Cathedral with such completeness as does Columbia's Media Center for Art History website.WWW.LEARN.COLUMBIA.EDU/AMIENS.HTML"
84,Art Humanities,Discussion examines the Core,5 February 1997,"By BECCA BURNS Contributing WriterNearly 25 students, instructors and chairs of Core Curriculum classes gathered last night at the Heyman Center to discuss the role of the humanities in the Core. Discussion at the forum, which was sponsored by the Heyman Center for the Humanities, the Columbia College Student Council and the United Students of Color Council, extended to a number of other topics beyond its original focus, including the quality of teaching in Core classes and possible changes in Core requirements. As in previous forums in the Reaching into the Core series, students expressed concern over the Western focus of the humanities classes in the Core. Adina Berrios, CC '9B, said the education offered by the Core lacks diversity. ""I'm very well-versed in Western issues and nothing else,"" Berrios said. Chair of Art Humanities and Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History and Archaeology David Rosand noted that Core classes have tried to integrate non-Westernworks in the past with poor results. ""[These works] are thrown in as a sort of expansionist token,"" Rosand said. ""There's not a neat fit."" Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures William Theodore deßary said the major cultures requirement does exist as an alternative, but it doesn't have as strong a role in the Core. ""Even though we do have Asian Humanities, the [Core] requirements don't direct students to those classes. We have the capability to do so, and it's unfortunate that the requirements don't foster that,"" de Bary said. Rosand added that in order to do justice to major cultures classes, it is necessary to maintain small sections like those in Core humanities courses, and this requires a stronger faculty base. ""We need more faculty bodies, especially due to class size enhancement, and we're working toward that,"" Rosand said. The issue of choice in the Core was also addressed in the discussion. Some students argued for more choice among Core humanities classes, with possible substitu-tion of non-Western art and music courses for the traditional courses now required. Others suggested that the current Core, though limited in options, forces students to study topics necessary to a complete education. ""Given the option, would you take it? Maybe not. But should you take it? I think so,"" Berrios said. Chair of Literature Humanities and Professor of English and Comparative Literature Kathy Eden agreed with Berrios. ""It might be a bitter pill to swallow, but we should be forced to swallow it,"" she said. Professors and instructors noted other benefits of the Core, including the intellectual interactions between students outside of the classroom fostered by a common curriculum, with Rosand summarizing the purpose of the Core. ""The goal of [humanities courses] is to elevate the student up to some level of visual literacy and provide a vocabulary with which to discuss art. I'm not talking about simply acquiring a cocktail party vocabulary, but the ability to react intelligently to art,"" Rosand said."
85,Art Humanities,Women in the Core lecture takes place in Wien lounge,26 March 1997,"By ELIZABETH K. CARROLL Contributing WriterHistory Professor and Contemporary Civilization Instructor Martha Howell and Art Humanities Instructor Laura Auricchio described the past, present, and future of the role of women in the Core Curriculum last night in Wien Lounge. Auricchio, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, began by talking about a feminism project which will make its first appearance in Art Humanities this fall. The project involves putting together ""kits"" on feminism that can be used as resources for the course. A team is currently working on collaborating bibliographies, discussion, essay, exam questions, and even museum visits pertaining to women and feminism. Completion of the kits is expected by summer. This fall, a simi-lar committee will begin collaborating such kits for Literature Humanities. Use of the kits will remain an option for each section's professor. ""We are not looking to incorporate more women into the Core,"" said Auricchio. ""We are trying to get professors to think about gender. These kits will enable them to draw on gender."" The readings and such materials included in the kits even contain some books written by men that bring up gender issues, according to Auricchio. ""We want students to understand both men and women and how they rely on the gender hierarchy,"" said Howell, who added that the Core has in the past attempted to incorporate feminism.""Ten to 15 years ago, we just added more women writers to the curriculum,"" she said. ""The problem was that the reason they had been left out in the first place was that they were second-rate. With this current project, we are showing how the male must exclude the female citizen."" This sparked a recollection from one of Howell's students who attended the meeting. ""The first paper that we wrote on Rousseau and the social contract had to address the question of whether the social contract could exist if it were to include women,"" said Julie Sensat, CC '9B. ""The answer wound up being that it could not exist because the men in the social contract could not have the rights provided without a private sphere in which women would have to stay."" Howell said that her education as a feminist began by deconstructing such texts as Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau. She said she sees a resistance to the patriarchy of these minds, yet she insists on their importance. ""Feminism relies on them more than the new generation realizes,"" Howell said. ""We need to really grapple not just what is wrong with them, but the possibilities they give us to speak."" Several members of the audi-ence indicated that they found it difficult to express their views on feminism with some of their Core professors. ""I think that has to do with inertia on the part of the faculty,"" Howell responded. ""They don't want to bother learning all this, which is why I think the kits are a good idea."" Auricchio added that the kits will draw feminism into courses of professors who do not tend to involve it in their curriculum by providing material like exam and paper questions when they find themselves in a bind. ""If this stuff is here, they can use it and that way it will get filtered into the system."" Meryl Zwanger, GSAB '95, questioned the availability of the kits for students. ""Will the materials be provided for students so they can have the option of exploring it even if their professor doesn't involve it in the curriculum?"" Zwanger said. Howell and Auricchio agreed that they thought it was a great idea, and Auricchio noted that the kits seemed, to her, to be an inclusive concept. ""I found I couldn't incorporate feminism without incorporating class, race, and everything else,"" Auricchio said.A discussion focusing on the importance of including women in the Core curriculum took place last night in the Wien Lounge."
86,Art Humanities,GS deans look to create core,2 April 1997,"By SABRINA ROJAS WEISS Spectator Staff WriterIn a town hall meeting School of General Studies (GS) Dean of Faculty Gillian Lindt, Assistant Dean Richard Braverman, and Dean of Students Rick Ferraro spoke about academic issues to approximately 20 students in Lewisohn Lounge last night . Lindt opened the meeting with asummary of the GS Committee on Instruction's (COI) work on formulating a core curriculum for the school. Lindt said students expressed concern at a meeting a year ago that the school's lack of classes such as those in the Columbia College Core left many GS students at a disadvantage. In most of the Columbia Collegehumanities courses, which GS students often take, the professors make references to information learned in Core classes such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities Lindt explained. Because GS enrollment in Core classes is strictly limited,Lindt said they often feel they are missing the foundations professors assume they have received during their tenure as a Columbia undergraduate. To remedy the situation, the COI has been considering the creation of a core compatible with the Columbia College Core. Braverman said plans are still very vague, however. ""[The GS core] would not be a substitute for Columbia Core classes, nor try to ape them,"" Braverman said. While still using the ColumbiaCollege Core as a model, Lindt said GS would try to give the classes a more multi-cultural perspective reflective of present-day academia. ""The Core classes are hallmarks of the time period in which they were developed,"" Lindt said. A GS core would also have to be compatible with the school's tradition of using distribution requirements that accept the credits of the school's many transfer students while at the same time providing a common foundation for all students, Braverman said. ""We need something that is not just ideologically driven but alsoworks for our students,"" Ferraro said. Lindt added that GS students can take Columbia College Core courses as electives if they give her a petition in writing and there are spaces available in the classes. According to Lindt, the COI has also been reviewing the math distribution requirement in response to student dissatisfaction. Lindt said the administration has been talking to the math department about making the Basic Math course a more valuable experience for students. ""The complaint I've heard at thelearning center about Basic Math is that it isn't taught, it's told,"" Bernie Lenahan, GS '97, said. To assist the GS night students who have been having trouble taking courses required for their majors, Lindt said most department chairs have agreed to a plan to increase the number of courses given at night. The plan would make all courses required for majors available at night, rotating over a period of three years and including summer sessions. In the case of the smaller departments, which might find it difficultto provide faculty for night courses, Lindt said they would be more flexible about course requirements. To solve the problem of GS students being closed out of chemistry classes, Lindt said the department has now made a commitment to hire adjunct professors if there are not enough graduate students to teach an adequate number of class sections. Lindt said any other difficulties GS students might have with being closed out of necessary classes can usually be remedied by giving one of the administrators a complaint in writing.At last night's GS town hall meeting, administrators discussed the idea of a core cirriculum for the school's students."
87,Art Humanities,Connors discusses dome architecture,16 April 1997,"By ELEANOR LAISE Contributing WriterApproximately 150 students and alumni attended a lecture entitled ""The Renaissance and Baroque Dome in Cultural Context,"" delivered by Dr. Joseph Connors, professor of art history and archeology and director of the Core Curriculum's Art Humanities program, at the Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Science Research last night. Yesterday's event was the fourth in a series of annual Magill Lectures in Science, Technology, and the Arts, established as a means of communication between the often-polarized academic worlds of art and science. Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) Zvi Galil, the director of the lecture series, pointed to the importance of creating a ""synergy between the arts, science, and engineering"" in his introductory remarks. The lecture's topic, the Renaissance and Baroque dome, was appropriate, Galil said, because it illustrates the ""beauty of art and engineering in one of its most tangible forms."" Connors' lecture traced the evolution of the dome from ancientRome through the modern era, placing equal emphasis on the technical and aesthetic aspects of the architectural form. Connors hailed the technological achievements of Renaissance and Baroque architects while focusing on the artistic value of the domes. ""There is an aura of spectacle connected with the domes,"" Connors said. ""They are a simulacrum of the heavens."" Moving from Roman architecture to the design of St. Peter's in Rome, the Louvre and the Pantheon in Paris, St. Paul's Cathedral in London, the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, and St. Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Connors discussed thehistorical continuity that made these widespread structures possible. ""St. Peter's became the archetypal dome,"" Connors said, ""casting its shadow as far as London, Paris, and even, at the close of the day, St. Petersburg and Washington."" Connors showed that each major architect made essential contributions to the ultimate success of the Renaissance and Baroque domes, despite constant revisions and professional disputes. ""No builder of a great dome could afford to neglect any domes that came before him,"" Connors said. ""This is not a story of scientific breakthroughs, but rather recognition of the past.""After the event, Galil expressed approval of the speaker as well as the lecture itself. ""Several people suggested Dr. Connors to me, and he proved to be fantastic. The talk was superb,"" Galil said after the lecture. Audience members, many of whom were SEAS alumni, found the lecture to have both personal and professional appeal. One alumna cited her own experience at Columbia as an example of the relevance of the lecture's goal to create a ""synergy between art and science."" ""I remember being completely bombarded with engineering classes,"" she said. ""I finally took a Renaissance architecture class, and I found it so refreshing."""
88,Art Humanities,"Met, MoMA now offer free admission with Columbia ID",15 September 1997,"By SUSAN FREEMAN Spectator Staff WriterAll undergraduate students enrolled at Columbia University will be able to gain free admission to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) using Columbia ID cards, as part of a new University program called Passport NY, University President George Rupp announced Friday. Columbia's agreements with the museums also include yet-to-be-finalized plans for student internships and work-study jobs at both institutions, as well as an internship program with Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. ""This is part of the enhancement of the undergraduate experience. Students who come to Columbia have opportunities to make use of some of the greatest institutions in the world. Now they can do it free of charge,"" University Provost Jonathan Colesaid about the program's inception. ""This is a great opportunity for Art Humanities students. I wish I'd had it last year [when I took the class]. It would have saved me a lot of money,"" Stephanie Bryant, CC 'OO, said, adding that now she will be more inclined to continue visiting the museums. Cole said all of the agreements are on a reciprocal basis and that no payment to either of the institutions was involved. According to a University press release, in return for free student admission and opportunities for work-study positions, employees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art who are enrolled in degree programs at Columbia may be eligible for tuition assistance. The agreement with the MoMA allows student internship opportunities in addition to free admission. In return, Columbia will allow MoMAemployees to use the school's libraries, collections, and courses. Cole said the University is in the process of securing similar arrangements with other institutions and associations such as the National Basketball Association, the United Nations, and IBM. ""These are job opportunities thatare available for Columbia students which would not be available for students at Princeton or Dartmouth,"" Cole said. ""Columbia has a special relationship with the city of New York,"" Rupp said in the press release. ""Our location in the intellectual and cultural capital of the world is a magnet for students and scholars fromaround the globe. Indeed, 19 percent of our students and 30 percent of our faculty have come to us from other countries, and most have become committed New Yorkers."" ""There is no question that this is a great opportunity. It just adds to the endless possibilities that come with Columbia and the City of New York,"" Steve Cooper, CC 'Ol, said.Thanks to the Passport NY Program, Columbia University ID cardholders will be able to gain free access to the Met and MoMA."

90,Art Humanities,"Modi, Rosand named Great Teachers",27 October 1997,"By DAVID KARP Spectator Features EditorMore than 40 members of the Society of Columbia Graduates crowded into Faculty House Thursday night to honor Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Vijay Modi and Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History David Rosand, CC '59, Ph.D. '65, with the Great Teacher Award. The Society of Columbia Graduates established the Great Teacher award in 1949 to reward excellence of character and the ability to interest students in a subject, as well as someone who is there for his or her students. Each year the award is given to two members of the Columbia undergraduate faculty, one from the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), and one from Columbia College. According to Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley, the award recognizes excellence in teaching as well as a commitment on the behalf of professors to continue the tradition of a quality education. ""Each year, the Society of Columbia Graduates meets to recognize two teachers who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in their role as teacher and advisor. Their commitment toj undergraduate education represents the seriousness with which we take our academic reputation,"" Quigley said. Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science Zvi Galil stressed the need for both superior teaching and innovative research at Columbia. ""One of my great pleasures as dean is the recognition of great teachers. They help to stress the centrality of an undergraduate education to Columbia's exis-tence,"" Galil said. Professor Modi, the SEAS recipient of the 1997 Great Teacher Award, began teaching at Columbia in 1986, and was tenured in 1995. According to Modi, the importance of teaching is not simply to transmit information to students, but to transmit passion for study as well. ""I believe that it is important to make an effort, as a teacher, togive students an experience that is hands-on; a practical experience in a subject, without sacrificing the subject matter,"" he said. Professor Rosand, a Columbia alumnus, has served as Chair of the Society of Fellows and Chair of Art Humanities. Additionally, he helped to establish the Wallach Fine Arts center in Schermerhorn Hall. According to Rosand, being the recipient of the Great Teacher Award has particular significance because of the long list of names to which he has now been added. ""It is strange to note that many of the pro-fessors on the list of Great Teachers I had the pleasure of knowing in an academic setting as well,"" Rosand said. Rosand added that, to him, the Great Teacher award represents all of the positive aspects of receiving a Columbia education, and he is happy to be added to the list. ""This is a very emotional time for me. While it is wonderful to note the list of esteemed professors to which I have been added, it is, in a way, a new responsibility which I must live up to. We all have to play our parts,"" he said.David Rosand, right, accepted his Great Teacher Award from a member of the Society of Columbia Graduates."
91,Art Humanities,Professor Murray speaks on medieval cathedrals,6 November 1997,"By JOHN V. BENNETT Associate Editorial Page EditorProfessor Stephen Murray, chair of the art history and archaeology department, delivered a brief lecture last night in Hartley Lounge on the medieval cathedral in the context of technological innovation. The lecture culminated in a presentation of a new computerized graphic display that Murray has developed. The technologicallyinnovative display uses digitized images of the famous Cathedral at Amiens as part of an effort to revamp the Art Humanities curriculum. Hartley-Wallach Professor-in-Residence and Professor of Civil Engineering Raimondo Betti said he invited Murray to present the lecture, entitled ""The Medieval Cathedral asHigh Technology,"" because he had been impressed with Murray's presentation two years ago in Low Library. Murray opened the program by discussing broad-based thematic issues in the field of art history, focusing on the Cathedral of NotreDame in Paris as an example of how art can be misunderstood by overlooking empirical evidence in the pursuit of ideological interpretations. Murray also presented a new program he designed that provides a computerized ""vir-tual-reality"" guide to Amiens Cathedral using quick-time movies and digitized graphics. This program, which was developed with the help of a Challenge Grant from the NationalEndowment for the Humanities, is now integrated into the Art Humanities curriculum as an innovative means of teaching students about Gothic architecture. The presentation garnered high praise from students in the audience. ""After having taken Art Hum I enjoyed seeing how the curriculum is being improved using new technology,"" Sara Steindel, CC '99, said. Resident Adviser Rekha Reddy, CC '9B, who is taking Art Humanities currently, said the new program ""seems like an especially vivid way to study theCathedral, especially because I'm architecturally challenged."" Murray concluded his presentation with the thought that Medieval Gothic architecture was, above all else, a radical break from existing convention —a ""plunge into the abyss"" that created flamboyant new structures with no certainty that they were even structurally sound. He said he felt the work in the field of digitized art as a means toward teaching art history was, in the same sense, just as startling a break with accepted tradition, with just as many possibilities for innovation and progress.Chair of Art History and Archaeology Stephen Murray discussed the medieval cathedral in terms of technological innovation last night in Hartley Lounge."
92,Art Humanities,Going Ape: The Guerrilla Girls Do Art Herstory BOOKS review,29 January 1998,"BOOKSreviewBy KIRSTEN OLDSTHE GUERRILLA GIRLS' BEDSIDE COMPANION TO THE HISTORY OF WESTERN ART By The Guerrilla Girls Penguin Books $18.95If you are in need of a short quick book to help you through Art Humanities, then the Guerilla Girls' Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art will be of no help to you. Conversely, it intends to debunk the myth that Western Art has been canonized solely by a group of white males. Sadly, while the Guerilla Girls find some female artists who have been forgotten from most art history survey books, their absence in these texts points to the fact that there were relatively few women artists before the 20th century. The book begins with a disclaimer: ""There are many women artists who deserve to be in this book and would be if we had more room."" However, the book's relatively small size and the large quantity of ""filler"" makeone wonder if other great women artists have existed to be mentioned in the book. The chapters on the early years, such as classical Greece and Rome and the medieval era, give more information on history of the periods and the treatment of the women in those times than on any one artist or woman. The background information is peppered with quotations from misogynist men of the period, such as Aristotle's elucidation of the distinction between the sexes: ""It is absurd to argue from an analogy with wild animals and say that men and women ought to engage in the same occupations, for animals do not do housework."" While this information is interesting, its relevance in an art history book is questionnable. It serves as just another reminder that maybe women artists did not play a great role in establishing Western art. When describing the 20th century, however, the Guerrilla Girls buttress a text otherwise lacking in content by presenting 14 artists who have affected art history. Although they decide not to mention living artists because they do not ""believe in evaluating or excluding"" their peers, they still have plenty of fodder with which to work, choosing to highlight artists that often get little publicity. These artists span all genres of art, many of which are not considered to be plastic art forms, such as weaving, quilting, and pottery.The Guerrilla Girls also emphasize minority artists, the likes of Tarsila Do Amaral, Alma Thomas, and Maria Montoya. Many people have never heard of these women before, even though they have all achieved groundbreaking feats; Montoya created her own movement of blackware pottery that incorporated aspects of her Native American heritage and which has since emblemized a pottery of the San Ildefonso pueblo. Thelma Johnson Streat was the first African-American woman whose work was incorporated into the MoMA's collection. But again the Guerrilla Girls steal the show away from Streat's artwork by focusing on the public's reaction to her. Another factor which detracts from the presumed purpose of the book is their attempt to lend it light, tongue-in-cheek atti-tude; however, instead of the levity they intend, it trivializes the women artists that they present. In doing so, they accomplish what they criticize male artists for doing —relegating women to frivolous roles throueh the course of art history. The book' c style also contributes to this effect; it combines mock letters ""written"" by female artists posthumously comic strips starring damsel-in-dis-tress heroines, and pulp poster-like presentation, causing one to take the book even less seriously. The titles of the chapters (for exan pie ""Classi babes,"" ""Ho flashes from the Middle Ages"") presumably intend to ape male treatment toward women, but instead merely reinforce it. The Guerrilla Girls also high light the womens' sexual lives, detailing accounts of abusive, prodigal husbands anusupportive lesbian lovers. One would think the authors would like to remove female artists from the sphere of sexual politics, but the Guerrilla Girls spendmore space talking about that than the artwork. This is disappointing in a book that ciaims to attack disgusting misogynistic treatment of women. These characteristics do not prevent the book from being an entertaining read. In fact, they make it just the right kind of book for a light, funny look at art history. But the Guerrilla Girls occasionally attempt to get too political, almost militant in their will to promote feminism and criticize misogyny. They say they use humor to show that ""feminism can be funny,"" but instead they present themselves as whining, bitter girls complaining about the bullies of Western Art. The everpresent gorilla mask painted over the faces of much of the artwork in the book ruins some very beautiful paintings, reducing them to the role of political agents in some kind of femi-"
93,Art Humanities,Summary Execution-LAUREN DeMILLE Unifying Core Course Needed To Contextualize All the Others,21 September 1998,"Unifying Core Course Needed To Contextualize All the OthersPerhaps suggesting another class to be added to the Core will not make me the most popular girl in the communal bathroomthis week, but I'm willing to take that chance. The Core already (and I think somewhat unwisely) dominates students' schedules for their first two years, but the class I shall propose would significantly enhance this pan-undergraduate experience, and make some students less resentful of the time and (sometimes) workload that the Core demands.I think that the Humanities segment of the Core stands as one of the most fulfilling aspects of this school, and I praise it to any Columbia-hopeful high school senior who asks me about the merits of the Core. During particularly rhapsodic moods, my enthusiasm reaches such a pitch that I feel entitled to ask for a commission from the University. I do,however, believe that without the opportunity to draw sweeping conclusions based on the important works studied in Art Humanities,Music Hum, Lit Hum, and Contemporary Civilization, the information garnered in each class might merely aid students in winning games of Jeopardy! or Trivial Pursuit. That is, no universal conclusions are drawn that show how each discipline interacts with another, and the currents of history. This interdisciplinary class could be taken the junior orsenior year andwould discuss such topics as how Bernini's sculptures and European writings of the New World were linked to the new nationalism andAbsolutism in Europe, or the relation between Modernism and World War I, as seen in the works of Picasso, T.S. Eliot, and Stravinsky. Many Humanities instructors do provide various degrees of historicizing, but the focus is clearly on the particular discipline, and incorporating aspects of other fields is, for the most part, not encouraged. The new class could place its focus on intellectual and sociopolitical history, examining the interplay between art, philosophy, andlife. Many students need or want this iteration of art and academia's relevancy to ""reality."" In fact, the way certain sections of the Core are taught seems anachronistic, given academia's embrace of postmodernism, of which historicizing is an"
94,Art Humanities,Roving Reporter on: Overcrowding,23 September 1998,"Compiled by Grace Lee Photos by Alicia DoughertyJAMES HU-YOUNG CC, 'Ol Do you think class overcrowding is a major problem at Columbia? Well, I think so, since a lot of classes are huge ... like biology, chera, and economics classes. Does it play a factor inyour course selection? No, not really... but sometimes big classes are g00d... like when the professor is boring and it makes it easier to sleep and get away with it How should Columbia deal with this problem? Get the professors to teach more sections.OLIVER MARQUIS CC, '99 How do you feel about overcrowding in classes? It's a problem, especially for lower level courses, but it doesn't affect me too much right now. Based on your experience, which classes have beenovercrowded? I had an Asian Art Humanities class that was so big because out of the two sections that were offered, one got canceled so 40 people showed up for one section. The professor had a lot of trouble trying to manage and determine who was going to be in the class. What ended up happening is the professor decided to go back to having two sections, one in midday and one at night. So did that work out? Yeah, for the most partHave you had trouble getting into classes? Not really, except for my core classes like CC. What do you think Columbia should do? Offer more sections for popular classes such as History of New York.PATRICK KUZNIA CC, 'Ol Do you think overcrowding in classes is a problem? Definitely. Do you want me to elaborate? All right, especially in the bigger classes like Principles of Economics ... you got about 400 people in there and you got people sitting onthe floor. When I was a freshman, chemistry was also definitely overcrowded. Basically, all big lecture esHow often do you not find a seat in class? I usually get there pretty early, but I see people sitting in other places- sometimes like in left-handed seats when they're right-handed, so you gotta learn to adjust. Does the problem of overcrowding play a factor in your course selection? No, you gotta take the classes that you gotta take, but if there happens to be another smaller section, then definitely try to get into it. How should Columbia address the problem? More professors.SHEFALIDESAI SEAS, 'OO Do you think class overcrowding is a major problem? In some classes, I've found that there are around 300-plus people, but that was a problem I faced mostly in freshman and sophomore years. Now, myclasses have gotten slightly smaller except for one with like 100-plus people. Whaf s the biggest class you've ever had? Chemistry with over 300 students. And because I'm in engineering, there isn't really much choice in what I can take. In those overcrowded lectures, I couldn't get to know the professor and there wasn't enough chances to ask questions. Possible ways Columbia will be able to eliminate the problem? ' Have more sections, flexible times for recitation, more open office hours."
95,Art Humanities,High AP Scores Often Fail to Make the Grade,8 October 1998,"By MATTHEW KONDARATOWIZ and MICHELLE J. LEE Spectator Contributing WritersIn high school, many students take advanced placement (AP) courses in hopes of exemption from certain college classes or attaining college credit. Once at Columbia, actually attaining either benefit from AP scores is much more difficult than many students expect. ""I spent a fair slice of money to show that I already know this stuff. Unfortunately, Columbia is of the opinion that the AP is not good enough of a measuring stick,"" Dixon Gaines, CC 'O2, said. Advanced Placement exams are administered once a year in a large variety of areas and are intended to test college level mastery of a subject. Scores range from one to five, with five being the highest score and representing a ""mastery"" of the material, according to the College Board's Educational Testing Service. A score of four shows deep understanding, while a three is ""passing."" The exact policy for any advanced placement at Columbia is decided by individual departments. Each year departments receive a copy of that year's exam for their subject and evaluate the exam according to their current standards. Standards vary for each department. In general, Columbia and Barnard College maintain a policy in which credit is only awarded for a score of four or five. Furthermore, when credit is awarded, even with a five, it is often not possible to receive exemption from certain classes, especially Core Curriculum classes. One example is the art history. Students scoring a five can receive three points of advanced credit in the Art History Department but still cannot be exempt from the Art Humanities requirement. ""Art Humanities is not a matter of the content of the course. It is a pedagogical experience that is a fundamental part of the Core,"" Associate Professor of ArtJonathan Crary said. Students who had hoped to be exempt from Logic and Rhetoric with a score of five on the English AP exam were also disappointed. ""My experience has strongly suggested that AP scores are not a good indication of how well a student writes,"" Sandra Pierson Prior, director of composition, said. ""AP scores are considered by deans and others in determining a student's placement and requirements in expository writing. However, AP scores are not the only or even the determining factor."" While students are able to receive three points of credit in the English Department with a five on the AP exam, there is no Logic and Rhetoric exemption. Barnard College: Less Rigid In comparison, Barnard's curriculum is less rigid than Columbia's Core. While first-year English is a mandatory class for Barnard students, an AP score of four or five can exempt a student. Yiyi Wong, BC 'O2, said she appreciated Barnard's looser requirements because ""it allows you to skip certain classes and then you can take the classes you want."" Not everyone shares this view. At a lecture presented by Margaret Vandenburg, director of first-year English at Barnard, some students exempted from firstyear English because of AP scores voiced complaints that a score of three should not be counted. Vandenburg agreed with Prior on the AP's accuracy, but made the following analogy: ""It would be absurd if a football player or dancer declared that they didn't need to practice. The same applies towards writing. It is a skill you need to practice in order to become better at it."" A Department by Department Decision Another subject in which Columbia students often seek exemptions is biology. The Biology Department at Columbia usually does not grant exemptions, even with a score of five on the Biology AP exam. The AP covers material usually taught in college introductory biology courses, but it does not duplicate Columbia's course, according to Deborah Mowshowitz, undergraduate departmental representative for Biological Sciences at Columbia. ""In an ideal world, we would like to have an intensive introductory biology class for students with special preparations in biology, but we don't have enough faculty to teach any additional intro courses. Given the staffing realities, we think it is far better to have some students suffer a little repetition than to throw them into courses that are over their heads."" Over the course of the year, departments analyze new AP exams to determine if they can distribute credit, and credit is applied to those that qualify, Ellen Kreger, first-year dean at Barnard, said. Same Throughout the Ivy League Columbia AP criteria is relatively similar to other schools in the Ivy League. At Harvard, most AP exams require a grade of four or five, except for the language exam, in which a score of three or better on the German, French, and Spanish exams can fulfill the requirement. At Dartmouth, on the other hand, exemption from requirements is usually not granted based on AP exam scores. ""AP credit seems to bring us more opportunities to enhance our knowledge with new ideas,"" Leonara Mui, an undergraduate at Cornell said. In the past, Columbia students received a letter in the beginning of the year stating their testing record and credit. This year, credit will be awarded in June, Kathryn Wittner, first-year dean of Columbia College, said. Barnard students still receive immediate notification of their testing results and exemption situation. Roughly 60 percent of the Barnard student body receives some AP credit, according to Constance Brown, registrar at Barnard. One-third of Columbia students send scores to the school, Dean Wittner said. Even without receiving credit, most students appreciate the value of taking AP exams. ""life is much easier because of all this [AP credit] Tanya Gullep, BC 'O2, said. ""Hard work should be accounted for."""
96,Art Humanities,IRC Showcases Multicultural Student Artwork,23 November 1998,"By CARLESTE HUGHES Spectator Associate News EditorUpon graduating from high school in Connecticut two years ago, Daryl Ng, CC 'O2, was required to enlist in the Singapore militia for two years. After serving in the military, struggling through basic training, and learning a national anthem in a language he could barely pronounce, Ng was ready to return to the U.S. When Ng finally completed his enlistment last spring, he celebrated with acrylic paint. His painting ""Flowers"" is a large and vibrant abstraction of all that he had learned from spending two years in his country of citizenship. ""It's a scene of spring. 1 just came out of the infantry, and I wanted to celebrate,"" Ng said. Thursday evening, dozens of students viewed the painting, hanging at the entrance to the Intercultural Resource Center (IRC) on West 114 th St. as part of the center's first multi-cultural art exhibit since 1989. Entitled 'Through My Eyes and By My Hand: Representations of Students of Color,"" the exhibit includes paintings, photographs, pastels, and graffiti art created by five undergraduates at Columbia. The exhibit is designed to offer physical suggestions about what culture is, according to Rhonda Henderson, CC 'OO and curator of the exhibit. ""All the paintings and drawings are what the artists believe to be their culture,"" Henderson said. The mission of the exhibit has been twofold. ""A bit of it is to celebrate and also to make people aware that there are a lot of students of color artists here. If you take art humanities, you are not going to get this,"" Henderson said. Henderson added that although African Art and art from other cultures do appear onthe Columbia campus, the experience of American minorities has not yet been adequately represented. ""There aren't that many physical representations of people of color at Columbia,"" Henderson said. 'The physical structure of the campus of Columbia University contains little that reflects the tradition of cultures of color and even less of its present community of color. This exhibit aims to fill the void,"" Henderson said. ""The exhibit was us, the community of color, putting out a bit of our own identity."" In addition to his painting, Ng also has four photographs hanging in the exhibit, all of which are excerpts from a series of photographs he took on the streets of Hong Kong. ""1 wanted to portray the idleness of the men in a really busy industrial district,"" Ng said of his photos of Asian men at rest. 'The perception of Asian culture is that Asian people are always on the move. I wanted to show that they take a break also."" For Ng, the exhibition at the IRC was a chance to show his art to a more diverse audience. ""Art transcends cultures or nations where languages form barriers,"" Ng said. Kenshin Ichikawa, CC 'Ol, has three lithographs on display in the exhibit. Filled with images of Asia including images of skulls and fetuses, and an image of Buddha hanging from an earlobe, Ichikawa said his art is an outlet for him to expresswhat is like to be a member of a minority group. 'The artist allows the unconscious to take control of the hand, creating a single image that expresses volumes and volumes of ideas and thoughts, making sense to the artist an abstract idea that reality and the conscience has thoroughly confused,"" Ichikawa said. ""I use art this way to understand myself."" The first of his images shows a spine extending from a fetus. ""For me, culture is my backbone. Culture starts in the womb,"" Ichikawa explained. Also included in the exhibit were pastel and pencil portraits of African-Americans. A Nigerian firstyear from the Bronx, Imo Nse Imeh displayed works entitled ""Cry Africa,"" ""Girl of Manners,"" and 'The Gift."" ""As a Nigerian I know that a tremendous amount of my inspiration is my culture, the history, the customs,"" Imeh said. The Intercultural Resource Center was founded in 1989 on West 113 th St. in response to an incident of violence between African-American and white students and prospective students in the Ferris Booth Hall during the 'Bos, according to its director, Susan Stuart. In the spring of 1997, the center moved to its current location on 114 th St. Currently the IRC is fully supported by the Institute for Research on African-American Studies and works with the newlyformed Latino Studies and Asian American Studies departments. The departments were created as a result of student protests during the spring of 1996. ""We at the IRC make a commitment to ethnic studies and to ensuring that the student protests weren't in vain,"" Stuart said Thursday. Stuart said she felt the exhibit was a success. ""I've heard nothing but positive feedback about the exhibit. I think there's something about art that bridges gaps in ways that we can't do with other exhibits,"" Stuart said. Students attending the opening were also supportive of the IRC's efforts to bring students of various cultural backgrounds together. ""I think it's great they are having it at the IRC—it's a central location. We need to have more art shows like this,"" Carolina Perez, CC 'OO, said. ""A cultural resource center is very, very important on a college campus that claims to have a diverse student body which it d0e5...l think that a center that is based around research'on culture and the juxtaposition of culture is very good,"" Ichikawa said. ""I grew up in Tennessee so most of my subject matter was seen as something that was hella different. People would be interested in it, but they wouldn't be interested in it for what is was."""
97,Art Humanities,Registration For Art Hum Causes Jam,2 February 1999,"By DANIEL FELDMAN and ANDREW FORREST Spectator Staff Writer and Spectator Junior Staff WriterThe Art Humanities Office has been underestimating the number of Art Hum sections needed over the past four years, causing a registration logjam for the course, according to officials in the Art Hum Office. Professor Barry Bergdoll, director of the Art Humanities program, said the problem was unforeseeable, even though the first-year College class has increased from 838 to 956 since 1994 and the Art Hum Office has only added one more section over that period. During that time the official cap on Art Hum classes has remained at 24 students, making it difficult for students to register for, or switch, Art Hum sections. Other Core classes have added sections as the undergraduate class size has grown; Literature Humanities and Music Humanities each added three more sections in the past five years, and Contemporary Civilization has increased from 46 to 54 sections in that period. ""What we have done in the College and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to address the needs of students as we have progressed through Enlargement and Enhancement is to try to accomodate student demands,"" said Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis. ""I think we have been rather successful,"" she said. Art Hum instructors, however, think otherwise. ""It presents a real challenge to teach this course when there are 30 students in a class,"" Art Hum instructor Lynn Catterson said. Catterson's two sections of Art Hum have 29 and 25 students. ""They want Art Hum to be interactive, and it is challenging with a class of this size,"" Catterson said.""It makes field trips difficult if the instructor is short,"" she added. Yatrakis 'said enrollment in Music Hum and Art Hum classes can be difficult to predict since students may take them at any point in their Columbia careers. ""According to our calculations we add sections as needed,"" Yatrakis said. However, as the College has encouraged students to complete the Core during their first two years, the number of students in each Core section has steadily risen. Using a formula of dividing the total number of first-years by the number of Art Hum sections per semester, it is clear that the ratio of students to sections has increased significantly. In Fall 1994 there were 29 College students for every Art Hum section. This semester that number stands at 32 and including SEAS students the number has gone from 38 to 42 students per section since 1994. Since first-year students are now preregistered for Art Hum and Music Hum, as few as two spots per section remain for upper-class students to fill in classes where the cap is 24 students. Every Art Hum section this semester is full, and every one but those offered at nine a.m. are over the cap. The number of students per class peaked in the 1996-97 academic year, when 975 College first-years squeezed into 29 Art Hum classes, 55 Lit Hum sections, and 25 Music Hum sections. The following year, the College Class of 'Ol fell to 961, and two Music Hum sections and four Lit Hum sections were added. In 1997-98, SEAS reached a peak number of first-years, with 316. Last week, the Art Hum Office stopped students from registeringfor Art Hum so its staff could catch up with all the changes in enrollment that had been taking place since the start of the semester. The registration freeze was the result of an overload which occurred when an unexpected influx of students, who had not registered for Art Hum during early registration in November attempted to sign up for the course two weeks ago, according to Bergdoll. ""We weren't oversubscribed until the first day of class,"" Bergdoll said. ""Now it's hard to fix anything because we're already in the middle of the mess."" As a result of the increase in Art Hum enrollment, many sections exceeded their cap of 24 students per class. The Art Hum Office then told Art Hum instructors to freeze changes in their rosters and submit a final, uncapped roster at the end of last week.Bergdoll said the shuffling led to incorrect rosters and glitches in the automatic registration system. ""The problem is the chaos of people moving back and forth between sections,"" he said. ""It's an extremely imperfect system."" One problem is that many students retain spots in Core classes even after they plan to stop attending, according to Deputy Registrar John Carter. ""It's a concession to people who don't drop the course on time,"" he said, noting that shopping and Core classes can only coexist ""in a limited fashion."" ""I hate to reward the bullies and punish the pious, but we'll do it if that's convenient for students,"" Carter said. In Sept. 1998, the entering classes of both CC and SEAS leveled off from previous years' increases, at 956 and 299 students respectively.Core classes, such as this Lit Hum section, have grown in size since 1994."

99,Art Humanities,"the cause Feature of seven activists, on the legacy and future of the movement",21 April 1999,"Feature of seven activists, on the legacy and future of the movementBy TIZOC BRENES AND YOJAIRY SANCHEZ Spectator Staff WritersIt was this time of the year. In April 1996, students frustrated with an inadequate African American Studies program, the lack of Latino Studies program and Asian American Studies program, organized a hunger strike and takeover of Low Library and Hamilton Hall. After five days of fasting, Heather Starr, BC '96, was carried to the hospital. Ten days later, and after 22 arrests, the activists and the administration agreed to a compromise. The last three years of the ethnic studies movement have consisted of negotiations between students and administrators to achieve the promises made by the 1996 agreement. Hiring senior and junior faculty in Latino and Asian American studies, and an overall strengthening of the three programs, has been the subject of student debate with faculty. Today, African American Studies is a thriving program, but Latino and Asian American Studies are still struggling to be established. Native American studies remains only a rare topic of conversation between advocates. All three existing programs are run from the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race. Advocates of ethnic studies are still fighting to find the subject's place in Columbia's curriculum. Ethnic studies has once again garnered recognition around the Columbia campus because of the activities of the organization Students Promoting Empowerment and Knowledge (SPEaK). The group organized a three-day Higher Education Conference earlier in April at the pinnacle of their activities this year. The conference, organized entirely by students, was the first conference that directly addressed the state of ethnic studies programs at Columbia, and encouraged a dialogue between students, teachers, and administrators. The activities of SPEaK demonstrate the position of the advocates —there is still much progress to be made. Seven current and former ethnic studies activists share their thoughts on and experiences with ethnic studies. Garcia One of the more visible figures in the movement this year has been Antonio Garcia, CC '99, co-chair of SPEaK Garcia joined the movement four years ago, in October 1995, out of a desire to be involved in the campus community. ""The community of color knew who was involved in the movement —they were articulate, visible, and passionate,"" Garcia said. ""I wanted to be like them, so I hung around them, and before I knew it, they approached me."" His time in the struggle, says Garcia, has shaped him as a student and equipped him with the skills that he needed to make an impact on society. ""The movement has changed my life in a powerful way,"" Garcia said. ""It has been my initiation into social justice, reformand activism, and more than anything it has developed me into a critical thinker and caretaker of my community."" Garcia said he believes those who criticize the movement should ask themselves critical questions regarding the apparent lack of racial equality within American society. ""They need to take a look around and ask themselves why Americans of color are disproportionately the most impoverished, poorly educated, and most disempowered sector of this country and many regions of the world over, and analyze why there are more black and Latino men in prisons than institutions of higher learning,"" Garcia said. ""If you don't believe that this is natural and that these people aren't inherently stupid or lazy, then drop your security blanket and dare to think about race, injustice, and inequality."" According to Garcia, many of his own personal experiences as a minority have motivated his participation in the ethnic studies movement. ""In my Contemporary Civilization class my sophomore year, I remember literally being taught that Native Americans were savages, and I don't remember any teacher addressing the critical implications of racism, sexism, and classism which affected our daily lives,"" Garcia said. ""I saw that the thinkers, writers, artist, musicians, generals, heroes were never Chicano, Filipino, or black and I realized that this was never intended for me.""Kaufman Elizabeth Kaufman, BC '99 and a co-chair of SPEaK, has been involved in the ethnic studies movement since her first year at Columbia. Her political activism, however, extends itself to her years in high school. The transition from activism in high school to college required her to temporarily step back and get acquainted with organizing at the college level, which the student leaders of the time showed her. ""The movement that was going on at Columbia was the embodiment of what I had been fighting for at my high school,"" Kaufman said. ""However, [Columbia's struggle] was on a scale that was hard for me to imagine, since the racial balance was so different and the level of organization was so high,"" she said, but she ""immediately related to it because I shared the same progressive standards, but I had to figure out what role I was going to play in it."" Kaufman said her commitment to the movement was strengthened by the attitude of people in academia toward people of color. ""My freshman year, [a Columbia researcher] conducted a 'study' of primarily African-American and Latino children where she tried to 'prove' that they were more prone to violence. She gave them some kind of substance that made them hyperactive and then tried to say her theory was right,"" she said. Kaufman's involvement with ethnic studies was gradual. ""I became involved as a first-year, but I wasn't in the core organizing group. I went to most rallies, general meetings, marches, etc., but didn't go to smaller meetings until my sophomore year,"" she said. Columbia's climate in 1995, the year Kaufman entered the College, was one awaiting explosion of social protest. ""My class, '99, entered at a very tense time politically. All of the organizing from the '6os to the '9os, led up to the conditions of '95 and '96, and the student base was extremely strong and reliable. The upper classes all had really strong leadership, and my class provided a lot of mass support and was basically down for anything,"" Kaufman recalled. ""We came in kind of in the middle of everything, to really fast paced conditions, and there was no time for an orientation —we learned through direct actions and observations."" Shiroma lan Shiroma, CC '99, is a Sociology major who graduated in December and currently works for the Coalition Against AntiAsian Violence. Like Kaufman, he arrived at Columbia just before the hunger strike and takeover of Hamilton.""l've been involved in this ethnic studies movement since around February of '96. I was familiar with the wealth of courses available at CUNY schools at the time and it was painfully clear that [Columbia's] offerings in ethnic studies were woefully inept. While that much was clear, I didn't understand my own power to do anything about it."" Shiroma was inspired by the leaders of that time. ""A multiracial coalition of fearless, dedicated, and articulate students became visible in their attempts to bring ethnic studies to Columbia. Sharod X, [then President of the Black Students Organization], was a part of that coalition who had gained national notoriety earlier in the year for some statements he made in his Spectator column. In February, he wrote something like, 'Students of all races and religions must come together to fight for justice',"" Shiroma said. Shiroma said he responded to the column by calling for more activism. ""I wrote to the Spec challenging all Columbia students to heed the call. For me personally, it was natural to support the movement because it reflected the discipline's explicit commitment to racial justice."" His reasons for being active in the ethnic studies movement were political and personal. ""I feel that the University has a responsibility to be a place where solutions to community problems are addressed and where students really struggle to find solutions. Ethnic studies is a field that attacks some of the more pressing problems of the community, institutional racism, poverty, and how those problems affect peoples everyday lives."" He added, 'To me, ideally, ethnic studies focuses on those problems in the community and creates new possibilities for solutions. On Columbia's campus there was so much racial tension—much more than I was accustomed to. Columbia was shocking. I have a younger sister, five years old. I felt a responsibility to be involved in the movement which fought for constructive solutions."" Shiroma recounted a critical experience in Contemporary Civilizations (CC) that deepened his understanding for greater representation of people of color in Columbia's curriculum. ""For me, one critical event was when we celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday in 1996 and we dedicated a whole class in CC. By far that was the most meaningful class of my career at Columbia."" Shiroma's realization helped him think about the entire curriculum, not just CC. ""It really highlighted the need for more of those forums, that the struggle for freedom and justice in this country didn't endpassing of a few laws in the '6os. Around that time, ethnic studies activist students \X were fighting against the racial- \^ N ly exclusionary curriculum at \ Columbia. It showed me how desper- \ ately students at Columbia needed a more meaningful curriculum which strove to further the struggle for justice in this country."" Ochoa One of the major figures within the Ethnic Studies movement of 1996 was Joaquin Ochoa, a graduate of Teacher's College and one of the 15 hunger strikers in the Spring 1996 protests. Unlike many of the student activists, Ochoa's participation in the movement began long before his time at Columbia. He says that his involvement started when he undertook a hunger strike for the establishment of a Chicano Studies department during his undergraduate years at the University of California at Los Angeles. Ochoa believes that, although progress might be slow, many people are beginning to recognize the importance of ethnic studies within higher education. ""I think that a lot of liberal whites have seen the benefits to the issues at hand and they don't live in a little bubble as much, so they see that learning about all people is important,"" Ochoa said. ""Before, I didn't see it happening, but now I know you need gay, white, black and all other communities to work together to build a strong bridge."" Columbia, says Ochoa, is at a good position for the development of an ethnic studies department, in that it would set the pace for other universities that are looking to develop a more culturally encompassing curriculum. ""The administration should take note that the room to forge a study for others to follow isn't always presented, so in my opinion this is a very opportune time for Columbia to be an innovator,"" Ochoa said. Jealous Ben Jealous was part of Columbia College's class of 1994, but graduated in 1997. He currently works in the Chaplain's office in Earl Hall. His long association with Columbia was interrupted his freshman year when he was suspended for his involvement in the Audubon Ballroom takeover during the fall semester of 1994. When he came back to Columbia, the ethnic studies move-ment was active, and \ despite his sus- \ pension, he joined \ the activists. \ Jealous says the reasons \ were ""basically friendship and solidarity with a number of leaders whom I had gone with to the Audobon, and a general frustration of lack of professors of color and the mistreatment of the ones that were here."" He acted as an advisor by sharing his expertise in political organizing. Jealous remembered studying the Core Curriculum and - finding that the experiences of his people were ignored or marginalized. ""The first day of Art Humanities, I was told that 'For the purposes of this class, we will consider Egypt to be in Europe.' For me, that geography was as tragic and misguided as it was creative and bold,"" Jealous said, ""In Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, they always throw people of color at the end. We were either negated or tacked on at the very end in a very nonchalant way."" Ethnic studies was an investment in the future, said Jealous. ""As a student of color at Columbia, I felt it was a responsibility to make sure that this university continued to be improved in ways [that many might not see]."" He continued, ""As someone who expected to be an alumnus of the University, I wanted to make sure this University was a place where I would want to send my kids to, that their culture would be valued, studied, and celebrated by this University.""Richardson Evans Richardson, CC 'O2, became involved in the Ethnic Studies movement shortly after his arrival at Columbia. He attributes this early activism to his disillusionment with school's curriculum. ""I came to this school expecting an education that would, as the College brochure claims, provideme with an 'international perspective and a cutting edge curriculum,""' Richardson said. ""I was deeply disappointed when I recognized the blatant Eurocentrism behind Columbia's curriculum."" By not providing students with an adequate curriculum, says Richardson, the school is not preparing students to face the realities of contemporary society. ""Every university should provide its students with a curriculum that will prepare them for life in an increasingly complex global environment, but the problem is that Columbia has yet to reconcile its academic rhetoric with its educational reality,"" Richardson said. ""If our goal is to cultivate the world's future leaders, let's free ourselves from the shackles of Western tradition, and create a new curriculum that will accomplish this task more effectively."" Richardson said he believes the movement is reflective of the need minorities have to receive an education that informs them of their own background and culture. ""This movement seeks to put the study of people of color within a position of academic legitimacy on Columbia's campus,"" said Richardson. According to Richardson, the changes that the Ethnic Studies movement proposes have wider possibilities for establishing change in the outside community addressing societal problems. ""Ethnic studies attempts to help everyone reach a greater understanding of race and ethnicity, how our notions of race have developed through the years and how we can identify and deconstruct the institutions that have perpetuated racism and the oppression of people of color for so long,"" Richardson said. ""Basically, the goal of all ethnic studies advocates is the liberation of people of color."" Baylor Amber Baylor, CC 'O2, just recently joined the ethnic studies movement when a friend invited her to one of the meetings for SPEaK. Baylor said she feels her activism has allowed her to more deeply understand her position as a student within the University and the responsibilities that come with it. ""Before I became involved I was enshrouded in a sort of apathy, but this organization has definitely encouraged me to play an active role in my education,"" Baylor said. ""I feel like imparting true knowledge means taking into account and trying to understand the various perspectives our society is comprised of, not simply observing these communities peripherally through a narrow, traditional viewpoint,"" she said. Baylor believes that her exposure to incidents like the death of Amadou Diallo, helped her to see the potential impact of ethnic studies in the community. ""If one thing was imparted to first-years of color, it was the danger of and chaos incurred by those in power when they are separated and completely out of touch with many of the ethnic communities they deal with daily,"" Baylor said. ""It is imperative that we work towards becoming more aware of the perspectives and histories of the people who surround us."" ""Many people are unaware, however, of the tremendous behind-the-scenes work [such as] planning sessions, meetings with administrators, networking, that goes on before students are forced into public protest,"" Baylor said.

100,Art Humanities,Hamilton to House New Core Office,14 October 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN Spectator Associate News EditorAs part of the planned renovation of Hamilton Hall's classrooms and entrance area, which is scheduled to begin within the next year, the University is constructing a new Core office that will serve as an administrative center and home of the new Director of the Core, College representatives said. The Core office, which will be located where the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is currently housed in 212 Hamilton, will become a physical center for the Core Curriculum where students,preceptors, and professors will be able to gather for social and intellectual purposes. The office will handle administrative actions, such as section changes for all Core classes, including Contemporary Civilization as well as Literature, Music, and Art Humanities. It will also house the Science and Major Cultures administrators to the Core, according to Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis. The new office will also serve as the administrative base for African Civilization classes, Yatrakis said, because there is currently nodepartment under which these Major-Cultures classes fall. Yatrakis said that the director of the Core position is a further development of the administrator of the Core position, which is currently filled by Eileen Gillooly. As administrator of the Core, Gillooly manages students' requests to change their Core sections, develops the class lists for Music and Art Humanities, and attempts to integrate the different aspects of the Core. Gillooly said that the new position does not add any duties to the current one. She will move into the position of director when the renovations are completed. The creation of the office is meant to unify all aspects of the Core, since many students consider the Humanities courses as separate from the Science and Major Cultures classes, Yatrakis said. ""We are seeing the office as a center for the teaching of, and the learning of the Core,"" she said. Yatrakis added that the committees on Science and Major Cultures will meet in the new office, and that all administrative actions associated with them, along with the humanities courses, will be centralized and overseen by the director. The office will be essential in the continuing integration of Major Cultures classes into the Core, Gillooly said. The office will ""facilitate interac-tion between various parts of the Core to Major Cultures to give it more support, and to greater integrate it into the Core,"" she said. Gillooly also said that the office would provide greater interdepartmental communication and encourage direct relationships between Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, and Art and Music Humanities. ""There is an idea that Lit Hum does in fact lead into CC, and that those two courses are highly connected with Music and Art,"" Gilooly said. Gillooly envisions an office where a student, inspired by his or her Literature Humanities class, will be able to research the connection of a particular book with a piece of music or a work of art that was produced in the same period, she said. Yatrakis said the office comes as part of recent growing support for the Core. She said a greater number of professors and graduate students express interest in teaching Core classes than ever before, and that there is a greater commitment to the pedagogy of those graduate students. The entire renovation of Hamilton will be ""a celebration of the Core,"" Yatrakis said. ""The office will give the Core a sense of place."" With the new office, a full-time administrative assistant will be hired to assist the Director position —it is the first such assistant to be hired in the College's history, Gillooly said. Yatrakis added that in the past, a single graduate student was responsible for all administrative aspects of the Core. Gillooly said that the decision to build a new office is one of manyrecent administrative changes to the Core. She said this was the first fall semester in which first-years were able to change their Literature Humanities sections via telephone. This policy was implemented in the spring and was made permanent this semester, she said. Gillooly also said that her office moved the deadline for changing sections via phone from October 17, which was the final date to add a non-Core class, to October 13. Gillooly noted that the move was ""a compromise between a desire to have a shopping period and credit the importance of not getting behind in Core classes."" In addition to the Director's office, there will be a seminar room, used for weekly meetings between graduate teachers of the Core and professors, as well as for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization staff meetings, Gilooly said. She wants the seminar room to have the ability to serve as a technologically advanced classroom. In addition, there may be a library as well as a separate area that would house computers. Yatrakis said that there is an ""outside time"" of two years for completion of the office. In December, architectural plans for the renovations of Hamilton will be submitted for approval, at which point the College will create a final blueprint for the new office. Construction will begin in May and be primarily completed during the summers. The goal for the completion of the renovation is the 2001-02 academic year, Yatrakis said. Facilities managers have said that Lion's Court will be used as a home for construction workers until the Hamilton renovation project is completed.Future Director of the Core Eileen Gillooly and her associates will be moved to a new office Hamilton."
101,Art Humanities,Core Remains Prize Jewel In Columbia's Crown,22 November 1999,"By CHARLES LANDOW Spectator Staff WriterIn an era of change, with construction dotting the campus, entering classes expanding, and departments moving to accommodate more students, Columbia College has remained steadfast in its insistence that every student complete the Core Curriculum. Even though some departments are making do with fewer profes-sors than they have had in the past, courses in the Core have remained small and, according to many of the instructors who teach them, relatively problem-free. ""It has never been better taken care of,"" J & G Siegel Professor of the Humanities Cathy Popkin said about the Core. Popkin, who also teaches in the Department of Slavic Languages, is the chair of Literature Humanities (Lit Hum). Eileen Gillooly, who as director of the Core manages all of its administrative aspects, agreed withPopkin. Despite growing College enrollment, the Core has maintained its small classes and will keep them, she said. ""With these kinds of pressures that the College is under, a lot of attention is being paid to the Core, so I'm not actually worried."" Interviews with 20 instructors of Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization (CC) revealed that, while individual departments may have their problems, most regard Lit Hum and CC as oases, sanctuaries from larger lecture classes. And their students agree. Nathania Nisonson, CC 'O3, said her Lit Hum class was ""a perfect size."" She said her teacher, a senior professor, often lets students lead the discussion. ""It's very good because it's not the professor talking the whole time,"" she said. Core administrators also spoke about closer integration of Lit Hum and CC with the Major Cultures, Art, and Music Humanities courses that comprise the rest of the Core.Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that integration would be enhanced by the creation of a Core office, planned to open in the lobby of Hamilton Hall in the next few years. The current health of the Core has come about despite claims of understaffing by history and English professors in their departments. Each department is obliged to staff a certain number of sections in the Core, with English and History contributing the most professors to Lit Hum and CC classes, respectively. These obligations, which have been increasing due to an enlarged enrollment in the College, are putting a strain on course offerings for majors in those departments but at the same time are maintaining the health of the Core. Still, there are two main concerns with the Core's continued strength: the size of sections and the percentage of senior faculty teaching them. Yatrakis said that the desired enrollment for each Lit Hum and CC section is 22. This year's average enrollment in Lit Hum courses is 20.5, and 21.4 in CC courses. Most of the instructors interviewed thought the size of theirclasses was appropriate. Professor of Classics Eleanor Dickey, whose CC section has an enrollment of 21 students, said, ""The size seems ideal, actually. I normally prefer small classes, but in CC a smaller class would make discussion harder —you need some diversity of opinion to get a good discussion."" Besides class sizes, another issue of discussion about the Core has been the ratio of senior tenured professors to junior nontenured professors and graduate student preceptors. Yatrakis said the University's goal is to have Lit Hum and CC sections taught by one-third senior faculty, one-third junior faculty, and one-third preceptors. Yatrakis said that even if the College wereable to fill each Core section with a senior faculty member, they would instead maintain the stated goal in an effort to have a ""multi-gen-erational"" staff of Core teachers. Some students have said they would prefer being taught by a senior faculty member, and some senior professors have said the level of the University's dedication to the Core is shown by the percentage of senior professors teaching Core classes. Others, though, say that senior professors are not necessarily better teachers than junior faculty or preceptors. Justin Marks, CC 'O2, who has a preceptor for CC, said about his instructor, ""I don't have any qualms about his status [as a preceptor], because he's so knowledgeable."" Of the 50 sections of CC offeredthis semester, 10 (20 percent) are taught by senior professors, 18 (36 percent) by junior faculty, 19 (38 percent) by graduate preceptors, and one by a part-time administrator in the Office of Alumni Relations. Of 55 Lit Hum sections, 12 (22 percent) are taught by senior faculty, 22 by junior faculty (40 percent), and 20 by preceptors (36 percent). (Attempts by the Spectator to find the teachers of the remaining two CC sections and one Lit Hum class were unsuccessful.) Not everyone is convinced, however, that more senior faculty would improve the quality of the Core. Popkin, the Lit Hum chair, called the preceptors who teach the Core ""the cream of the cream of the cream of the graduate student crop. They are so smart it's terrifying,"" she said. ""I don't think the program would be served by reducing the number of preceptors. I think they breathe life into the program."" Professor of Political Science Douglas Chalmers, who teaches CC, said, ""I think graduate students are often better teachers than professors. I don't think the ratio is a problem. I think they ought to continue to urge seniors to teach, but it isn't a crisis."" Bonnie Kent, a religion professor who also teaches a section of CC, said that senior professors have more experience than preceptors, but added that graduate students are apt to pay more attention to their sections. For a preceptor, Kent said, a Core class is ""like your first child. ""If your section coughs twice orlooks frightful, you panic. That level of attention fades with age,"" Kent said. Though the ratio is not now cause for concern, some instructors still said that more senior faculty should give the Core a try. Professor of Islamic History Richard Bulliet said, ""As I see it, what other university would allow their professor of Islamic history to conduct a class on Plato, St. Augustine, Michelangelo, and Virginia Woolf?"" Bulliet currently teaches a section of Lit Hum and has taught CC and Art Humanities in the past. The interviewed professors said the main reason few tenured professors teach the Core is that there are far fewer incentives for them to do so than there are for younger instructors. Dean of the College Austin Quigley said that the College has created a set of endowed chairs that would give senior faculty a monetary incentive to teach the Core.Quigley said that the chairs are given to faculty members, selected by their peers, for five years. In a speech given at the Hamilton Awards last Wednesday evening, Quigley said three new chairs had recently been established, and that two are about to be established."
102,Art Humanities,1923 College Discovers an Ideology and Changes,13 December 1999,"""We are here to gain a firmer message upon the realities of life, to get knowledge and to transmit it into wisdom, to find new understanding and to be guided to new interpretations, both of nature and of life and of organized man.""Although Nicholas Murray Butler's 1919 commencement speech was not directly addressing the College's brand new Contemporary Civilization course, his lofty sense of purpose for the University reflected Columbia's search for explanations of the unparalleled destruction caused by World War I. The faculty members who created the first class in Columbia's Core Curriculum in January of 1919 believed that an understanding of the present was predicated on the understanding of the philosophy and events of the past. Twenty years previously, a controversy raged in Columbia as the school began to drift toward what today's students would call a pre-profes-sional education, moving away from its traditional focus on liberal arts. The cause for an education that rooted itself in classical Western thought was championed by Professor John Howard Van Amringe, a reject of Columbia's 1890s Greek and Latin department and a mathematics professor who had a reputation for ""favoring athletes over serious students,"" according to An Oasis of Order, Timothy Cross's book on the Core Curriculum. Van Amringe wanted a liberal curriculum ""to teach [students] to look before and after, and in general to use their minds in ways which are appropriate to civil existence."" But Van Amringe, teaching at Columbia at the turn of the century, would fail at his attempt to shape the University into a haven of liberal arts that produced ""gentlemen.""It took until the First World War and a ""war issues"" course, offered at the request of the United States Army for their Student Army Training Corps, to stop the institution's slide toward pre-professional training. But by the time ""war issues"" became Contemporary Civilization in 1919, Van Amringe's lofty statement had been replaced by the desire to educate students who have knowledge of and question contemporary politics. ""The idea rests upon the belief that each new generation as it grows into maturity needs to be aware of the problems of its own group,"" said John J. Coss, first director of the CC program. ""And [they] should be brought to some appreciation of its responsibility within that group."" It is ""an attempt so to inform the students that their social usefulness will be increased in proportion as they follow the methods of intelligent investigation and discrimination,"" said then-Columbia College Dean Herbert Hawkes. Today, as Columbia celebrates the Core's 80th birthday, Van Amringe's statement is an ideal philosophy that attempts to give purpose to Columbia's College insistence that its students take CC, along with Literature, Music and Art Humanities. Coupled with the additions of Logic and Rhetoric and distribution requirements in Major Cultures, science, foreign languages, and physical education, the Core provides the undergraduate College with a universal identity. ""Having this very solid undergraduate education prepares you for life,"" saidDirector of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly. Because every undergraduate in the college must take the full Core Curriculum, it provides a common academic experience for all students to share with one another. Cross said that these required classes give students a common vocabulary ofthe means for intellectual 4f discourse. The ""war issues"" class was in part created to explore the issues surrounding the current conflict in Europe. The end of the war marked the shift in ideology from war issues to issues that concerned American citizens in times of peace, and was temporarily renamed ""peace issues"" and then ""Contemporary Civilization."" The move to institute a mandatory general education course was met with opposition by some faculty members. Many professors felt that the proper mission of a University was to prepare students for future professional work and that a liberal arts education was becoming superfluous in an increasingly modern world. In turned out that CC proved so popular that a second year was added in 1928. The freshman course, CCA, focused on historical issues that shaped the present, while the second year, entitled CC-B, focused on current political and economic problems. However, CC-B proved less popular among students than CC-A. After persisting for a number of years, a 1959 committee recommended that the course no longer be required. The University followed this suggestion in 1961. At the same time that CC was flourishing, Columbia added a General Honors course in 1920 at the behest of Professor of English John Erskine, 'OO. The precursor toOLiterature Humanities, the course was a two-year sequence offered to elite students who passed examina-tions and received personal recommendations from professors. The course consisted of small discussion groups reading well-known works of literature in translation, as Literature Humanities does now, but was discontinued when a second year of CC was added to the curriculum. Given the success of CC in the early '3os, Professor Mark Van Doren led a movement to add a sequence of literature courses to the general education program. The first course entitled Humanities A and later renamed Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), began in 1937 and was required for first-years. The syllabus incuded literature that dated back to medieval times. The second required course, Humanities B, was devoted to fine arts and music and was to be taken in the sophomore year. In 1941, Humanities B was split into two separate semester-long classes that covered art and music individually. Music and Art Humanities became a required component of the Core Curriculum in 1947. There have been several failed attempts to add a science course similar in scope to the humanities to the Core. As early as 1934, Hawkes oversaw the development of an optional two-year science sequence. Loosely modeled after CC, the courses provided a general education in the natural sciences. In 1941, however, with faculty focusing their efforts on World War 11, Science A and B were dropped. Since then, other attempts to addft* general, inclusive science classes to the core have been unsuccessful. According to Cross, among others, science often involves lab work, and thus it would be difficult to offer nonspecific overview courses. The Core thrived in the years following World War 11, solidifying its place in the College and in Western education. Administrators and professors from other universities regularly took trips to Columbia to observe its famed Core. Humanities A and CC sections were taught by some of the College's most distinguished faculty members, including Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, '25. Adding to the Core's influence within the University was the 1959 decision to require engineering students to take some Core classes. However, the Core did have its opponents. Increasingly, students and faculty denounced Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization as the study of dead white males. In the aftermath of the 1968 protests, students deemed the Core to be conservative, Eurocentric, and irrelevant. In 1970, a committee headed by Professor Robert Belknap proposed replacing Core classes with distribution requirements. In response to the committee's suggestion to end CC, the editors of the alumni publication Columbia College Today wrote: ""Even if the course is still basically sound, its eventual disappearance would not necessarily be a tragedy."" In retrospect, Professor William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, described the committee's recommendations as ""insignificant"" and said that the Administration never seriously considered implementing the plan. In 1988, a committee headed by de Bary asserted that CC and Lit Hum should maintain a Western focus and recommended that the Core be extended to include new courses that would examine Asian and African civi-"
103,Art Humanities,Keeping the Romance Alive Professors Find Love Amid Academic Demands,14 February 2000,"Professors Find Love Amid Academic DemandsBy CELINE GOETZ Columbia Daily SpectatorAlongside the links to his CV, various papers, and research results, Economics professor Matthew Kahn's Webpage concludes with another proud statement, ""Everyone knows that economists are romantics at heart. Professor Costa and I were married on May 29, 1998."" Professor Kahn is not the only Columbia professor with a romantic side. In the midst of academia, with its reputation of tough competition for tenure, grants, and publication, top professors find love —often with each other. In fact, the marriage of Professor Kahn and his wife, Professor Dora Costra of the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, has been a subject of research for the two. Together, they published a paper on the rise of dual career households, or ""power couples,"" a phenomenon experienced by the couple first hand. According to Professor Kahn, the couple found that, ""the co-location problem of 'power couples' increases their demand for living in big cities."" Thus, Columbia's location is a recruiting tool for professors from Dartmouth, Yale, or Cornell (holding salaries constant) because New York City gives a career-minded spouse a lot of freedom. Along the lines of Kahn's research, Professors Carol Sanger and Jeremy Watson were both able to find positions beneficial to their respective careers at the Columbia Law School. ""We were about as blessed as one [couple] can be,"" said Professor Watson. ""When the opportunity to move to Columbia came, it was a good move for both of us."" The couple met at the University of California-Berkeley in 1989, at which point both professors had already established careers in their field. ""I just met her in the coffee shop one day,"" Professor Watson reminisced. The two professors have different backgrounds—Professor Watson is from New Zealand and trained at Oxford, whereas Professor Sanger is American and trained at Wellesley College and the University of Michigan. Their interests compliment each other, though. Professor Watson specializes in the philosophy behind law, while Professor Sanger focuses on family law and contract law. ""For her, it's a new experience getting into the more philosophical argumentation. For me, it's getting used to policy theory and also literary theory,""Professor Watson said. Unlike Professors Watson and Sanger, Professors Dawn and Andrew Delbanco also met when they were quite young. Now married for 26 years, the couple ""met as undergraduates at Harvard, went through graduate school together, and began teaching at about the sametime in the same place,"" the Delbancos said. Like Watson and Sanger, they feel fortunate to be together teaching on the Morningside Heights campus. ""Though it is not a novelty for us to be in the same academic institution, we feel very lucky to be at Columbia today,"" the couple added. While the specialties of the Delbancos differ—Dawn Delbanco teaches Art Humanities and Asian Art Humanities, while Andrew Delbanco teaches Literature Humanities and courses in American literature — ""there does seem to be some traffic between our courses,"" they commented. In other words, students will take the courses of both professors. Luckily, ""so far, no student has placed any stress on our marriage by praising one of us excessively to the other,"" said the Delbancos. Like the Delbancos, prominent Economics Professors Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai met in Cambridge, Massachusetts and havebeen together for a considerable amount of time. Both from the West Coast of India, the two met in 1957 and have spent almost four decades together. Like Kahn and Costa, the couple has conducted research together. Before they were married, the two professors wrote a book entitled India Planning for Industrialization. Together, they argued that India needed to open up to the world economy in order to reduce the country's poverty. Writing the book ""deepened our relationship,"" Bhagwati said. ""We saw eye to eye on that [issue]... How can you see so much poverty and not want to do something about it? But we didn't just want to state sediments and slogans; we wanted to examine what India was doing about it [in thebook]."" Desai also felt that the joint writing of that book was an influential force on her life. ""That [experience] made me think, should I be doing professional work in the area that is also my husband's professional area?"" Desai said. ""Because we were both working then in economic development, I decided to switch to [specializing in] the Soviet Union."" Desai emphasized the need to maintain a professional identity when married to an equally prominent professional in the same field. ""The search for professional identity should be important for every person, but especially for women,"" Desai said. ""And when you are married to someone who not only works in the same field, but also the same department, ... it's very important to have separate identities."" Accordingly, she has kept her maiden name, as a sign of her professional identity. Ultimately, one of the main bonds Bhagwati and Desai share is a willingness ""to take on positions where we are alone some of the time,"" Bhagwati said. Both experts in their field, Desai and Bhagwati have stood up and supported arguments that have not always been popular. For example, Desai said she would not support the ""shock therapy"" approach to revitalizing the Russian economy after the fall of the Soviet Union. Although few other specialists in the field shared her view, she believed that reforms must be gradual. Bhagwati supported his wife's position in this matter; to this day, he recounts her debates on McNeal/Lehrer News Hour. Desai shares this admiration for her spouse. ""There is no one whom I admire more [than my husband],"" said Desai. ""He enters the room and the sun comes out.""In the midst of academia, with its reputation of tough competition for tenure, grants, and publication, top professors find love—often with each other.When you are married to someone who ... works in the same department ... it's very important to have separate identities.' —Padma Desai"
104,Art Humanities,"Core Awards Honor Art, Music Hum",18 February 2000,"BY DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily SpectatorDuring his junior year, Maurice Toueg, CC '96, was behind in taking classes in his economics major and working late nights at the Spectator. He certainly didn't think that he had time to take a class on Mozart, especially not one that met at 9 a.m. But Professor Elaine Sisman, his former Music Humanities instructor, was teaching the course, and he never missed a class all semester. Sisman, along with Professor of Art David Rosand, was honored last night at the 7th Annual Core Awards for commitment to the Core Curriculum, which speakers said encourages breadth of vision. In his opening remarks, John Mitchell Mason Professor Emeritus William Theodore de Bary distinguished between other forms ofteaching and teaching the Core, which he said required professors to draw students out in a classroom setting. ""Everyone wants to get in on the act of recognizing great teachers,"" he said. ""But there's a difference between getting in front of students and performing and the type of experience the Core provides, where the whole learning group must perform for themselves."" Professor of Art Jonathan Crary said in his introduction that Rosand was intent on keeping the Core Curriculum focused on refining methods of intellectual inquiry rather than on learning specific facts. ""Whenever we interview graduate students applying to be precep-tors for Art Humanities, and we ask them how they would teach, say, the Parthenon, the graduate students always say that they would give their students an overview of the history of Greek sculpture or something,"" Crary said. ""Rosand always says, 'no, that's precisely what you're not going to do.' He understands that that's not what it's about."" Dean Austin Quigley agreed with this sentiment, saying that without the Core, it would be too easy to ""gain depth of knowledge at the expense of breadth of vision."" He added that undergraduate education excessively focused on major-specific instruction allows students to ""learn more and more about less and less."" Rosand said that his experiences teaching Art Humanities were among the best of his career. 'The previous speakers have said that my commitment to the Core is selfless. I consider it the most selfish —in terms of self-fulfill-ing—thing I've done,"" he said. Crary said that it was his experience as a Columbia undergraduate in Rosand's Art Hum section that convinced him to be an Art History major and to go on to become a professor. Sisman defended the Core against charges that it is too timeconsuming. ""From time to time, people suggest that students only be required to take either Art Hum or Music Hum. When I hear people say that, I always think, would you rather cutout your eyes or cut off your ears?'"" Sisman said. In his remarks, de Bary stressed the importance of the Core in an era when college courses are being offered over the Internet. ""It is unlikely that something called 'distance learning' can match the attention given to students by the Core,"" he said. But new technology also gained a favorable mention last night, due to Rosand's attempts to integrate new media into Art Hum instruction. Rosand recently completed the Raphael Project, which uses electronic media to analyze one of Raphael's frescoes and which is now being used by Art Hum staff. ""[Rosand] continues to provide colleagues and preceptors with a powerful sense of the original vision of the Art Humanities program while actively leading efforts to modernize the program for the 21st Century,"" said the event's program notes. Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen said that while he did not take the Core himself because he did not attend Columbia as an undergraduate, he was impressed by the effect that it has had on Columbia graduates. He cited as an example David Denby, CC '65, a film critic who came back to Columbia several years ago to write a book on the Core. ""Most of the time when you have a midlife crisis, you go out and buy a Porsche. If you're a Columbia alum and you have a midlife crisis, you retake Literature Humanities,"" Cohen joked.Art Professor David Rosand is presented with his award."
105,Art Humanities,"Often Overlooked, Smaller Depts. Thrive",22 March 2000,"By DAVID SOLOWAY Columbia Daily Spectator■ Despite enticing options that smaller departments provide, most undergraduates are looking elsewhereUndergraduates often come to Columbia in search of one-on-one interaction with their professors, small class sizes that attempt to fos-ter discussion and student participation, and advisers who actively guide stu-five majors are often understaffed, cannot always offer the numerous courses that are needed to fill the excessive demand, and lack the necessary personnel to guide individually the hundreds of students that are a part of their discipline. It is in many of the other smaller departments that students would appear to reap the most rewards, as majors like Classics, art history and archaeology, and religion, among others, provide a menu of options that seem very enticing to the average undergraduate. While these departments often face the burden of less flexibility and fewer resources than their fellow departments, they offer much of the personal attention that many Columbia students say their education often lacks. ""Many of our students have had a higher level of satisfaction in our discipline because they never have the fear of going unnoticed,"" said Roger Bagnall, chair of the Classics Department for six years. ""Our undergraduates are attracted at first because of material, but they thrive because of the individual contact and because of the attention that is given to each and every major."" Yet regardless of the benefits that Bagnall praises, the flow to the larger departments appears to be a growing trend. ""I understand that the smaller departments provide me with certain aspects that I might not be able to find elsewhere,"" said future Economics/Political Science major Dany Berghoff, CC 'O3. ""But I'd rather spend my college years pursuing what I enjoy, and the more popular disciplines just interest me a lot more."" Some departments fear the possibility that a lack of student interest will either lead to a drasticdents down their desired path. Yet when choosing a major, a majority of the undergraduate population opts to follow the masses, as most drift to the departments of economics, political science, history, English, and psychology. Students consistently say that thesereduction in the size of the faculty of their department or, in the extreme case, will lead to the extinction of the department. Pierre Force, chair of a French Department that has approximately 35 undergraduate majors and concentrators, worries that his major will eventually reach the point where it will be too small, a dilemma of which the faculty of the more popular departments can only dream.""Our primary concern is that we will lose the major,"" Force said. ""Our faculty size has a strong correlation with the number of majors we have, and any given year we could lose our students to the other departments."" Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen believes that for many students, it is simply a default decision to go to the more popular majors. But he added that the University takes steps to preserve the smaller departments, not simply looking at enrollment numbers when determining the allocation of funds. ""Undergraduate instruction is a primary mission of any department, but the smaller ones are obviously able to provide those undergraduates with more personal interaction,"" Cohen said. ""We would love to see students spread out on a larger level, but that is something we would never attempt to mandate. The University prides itself on being strong in every department, and it is for the students to choose where to spend their time."" The decision to take the road less traveled is one that is not met with much enthusiasm by many students. But it is a decision with its advantages and disadvantages, as the smaller departments provide their undergraduate majors withboth much to be desired and much that they have no way of providing. Strengths A student has a strong possibility of dedicating a significant portion of his/her Columbia career to one of the five most popular majors without ever developing a personal relationship with any one professor. In the smaller departments, the lack of individual contact is a rare occurrence. ""We make a large effort to make sure that each student is actively involved in the major,"" said Hamid Dabashi, acting chair of the Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures (MEALAC) Department. ""We have just 30 juniors and seniors that we are responsible for each year, and we strive to have each one leave feeling that they have relationships with our faculty that have influenced their college careers."" The extreme case of student/professor interaction is best seen in the Italian Department, where five full-time professors teach the eight tol2 majors and concentrators. 'We are a small and friendly department where one-on-one interaction is not only available, but necessary for the student to take full advantage of what the department has to offer,"" said Jo Ann Cavallo, acting chair and associate professor for the Italian Department. Most of the smaller departments also offer smaller courses to their majors. While some of the introductory courses offered to all undergraduates, including Core classes, are often large lecture classes, the more advanced courses usually have a number of students that facilitates good discussion. In the MEALAC Department, the average class size that a major will see is from 10 to 40 students, according to Dabashi. Religion majors rarely take classes with more than 20 students, according to Department Chair David WeissHalivni. The Classics Department offers a couple of lectures with 60 students, but most of its classes have 15-30 people, according to Bagnall. ""Class participation is an integralpart of teaching,"" Dabashi said. ""And the only way to guarantee that each of our majors will actively participate in class discussions is to provide them with the intimate setting to do so."" But perhaps the most advantageous quality of the smaller departments is the guarantee that students will always know what is required and how to best meet their needs and desires in the department. ""I never have to worry about being led down the wrong path,"" Classics major Frank Mazarela, CC 'Ol, said. Advisers meet with their students multiple times throughout the semester, and the departmental representatives don't see the large loads of students that the advisers from the larger departments do. Bagnall said that in the Classics Department students are not only required to meet often with the departmental representative, but they often feel comfortable consulting their professors as well for advice. ""Our representative has a manageable load, and for that reason our students get most of their ques-"
106,Art Humanities,Enrollment For Summer Session Rises,2 August 2000,"BY SUNNIE KIM Columbia Summer Spectator■ Small classes, personal instruction attract over 2,300 to Summer SessionStudents searching for a meaningful way to spend their summers have increasingly turned towards the University's summer session. Whether the participants hope to fulfill core curriculum requirements or perhaps hone potentially marketable skills, one fact is evident: the popularity of the program is increasing. This year's summer session has increased enrollment 19 percent since 1998, resulting in almost 2,400 participants, according to Director of Summer Session Dr. Carole Slade. For these students, the most popular reason to take summer courses is to gain course credit at either Columbia or, for the 480 students who do not attend Columbia during the academic year, at their respective college or university. ""98 percent of the...courses I direct confer college or graduatelevel credit,"" Slade said. ""Students using the summer to try out new fields choose to take the courses for non-credit."" Among the most popular summer courses that students take for credit include core requirements such as Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Latin American Humanities. In addition, courses that count towards majors and classes like photography and other equipment-based courses whichhave limitations of enrollment, thereby closing quickly during the year are also popular. For students who do not have room in their fall and spring schedules to focus on their potentially marketable skills, the summer offers students a chance to take classes like computer game programming and corporate finance. Students who face problems trying to get a spot in an especially popular course during the regular academic year are more likely to take courses like Professor Katherine Morgan's Introduction to Accounting and Finance and Professor Kristiaan Versluys' New York City in Recent Fiction. During the summer students have an easier time enrolling in these popular courses. As a result of the smaller pool of students during the summer, popular courses such as these are, according to Slade, ""usually smaller than academic-year courses, allowing a good deal of individual attention."" Professor Besserman, currently a Professor of English and Comparative Literature from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem teaches a course entitled Bible and English Literature. With 20 registered students in his class and several auditors, the personal interaction between professor and student has impressed Besserman. ""I'm gratified with the high level of dicussion and the fact that they teach me too,"" Besserman said. The classes, which are more diverse in the summertime, have a mix of students from the four undergraduate schools and graduate schools at the University. Besserman's course, which he characterizes as a ""nice variety [of students]"" has a balanced mix of undergraduates and graduate stu-dents. ""[The classes] are definitely smaller and more intimate...there are students from other schools,"" Daniela Mitrovich GS 'Ol, said. As for the rigor of these summer courses, summer school personnel, administrators, and students agree that the quality of these classes and the amount of work expected from students remain the same as during the academic year. To attest to the quality and intensity of these classes, Isabel Trafton, GS 'O2, noted that even ""two science classes at a time was way too hard."" Students had mixed reactions to the truncated time for each class, some appreciating the increased amount of information but others wondering whether they will remember all the information once the class is over. Mitrovich, who is currently taking Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature believed that the intensity of a summer class made it easier for her to absorb the information. However, Trafton, who is also enrolled in the same course course said, ""I liked doing things intensely, but I don't know how much I'll remember later on."" Nevertheless, Slade and some students noted that summer classesare often the highlight of a student's academic career. ""Students often comment that their summer courses are among the best they have taken at Columbia,"" Slade said. Mitrovich, who despite disliking the courses she has taken over the summer, attributed her problems with the professors themselves and ""nothing to do with summer session."" ""But I generally think the classes in summer are better. I get more because there is a lot of info in a shorter amount of time,"" Mitrovich said. Slade hopes that the summer courses, despite their shortened length, will still provide students with the same amount of academic challenge, even serving as an equivalent to the academic year courses. ""My goal is to offer high-quality courses that complement or extend the academic-year offering,"" Slade said. ""Of necessity, summer courses are different, in that they are compressed into six weeks. If the courses are well-planned and if students avoid overextending themselves with a heavy work schedule, similar results can be achieved."" Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis noted that theCommittee on Instruction (COI) now approves all courses offered in the summer that will receive college credit. As a result, Yatrakis said, ""this is a very good change in policy and means that the faculty see the summer session as having the potential to enhance our curricular offerings to students."" Columbia students who wish to enroll in these classes are automatically accepted into the session. Those from other universities and colleges undergo an application process, which Slade explained to be as a good indicator of whether a student would be able to flourish in Columbia's academic setting. ""Students are admitted only if their academic records suggest that they will be able to succeed in Columbia's very competitive academic environment,"" Slade said. Faculty members during the summer session, of which approximately 10 percent hold full-time professorial positions at Columbia, and of which about 15 percent hold regular or part-time positions as instructors or lecturers at the University, number almost 200. In addition, professors from other colleges and universities also have ties to Columbia, many of them alumni of the undergraduate or graduate programs. Professor Besserman, CC '6B, who taught his English class last summer as well, explained that the favorable experience he had at the University during his undergraduate years, in addition to the locale of Morningside Heights, have encouraged him to teach again at the University this summer. ""[The University] is really thriving—very desirable —as it was when I was here,"" Besserman said. Additional Research by Derek NarendraCourses like this printmaking class, which normally fill up quickly due to enrollment limits, are more accessible in the summer."
107,Art Humanities,Core Profs. Honored in Ceremony,15 November 2000,"BY AMBA DATTA Spectator Staff Writer■ Speakers award gifted faculty, discuss concerns for future of the Core.During a ceremony marked by concern about the future of what Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley termed the ""intellectual signature"" of the College, Professors Robert Belknap and Richard Kuhns were honored with the annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum. Held in the Heyman Humanities Center last evening, the ceremony featured several speakers lauding the contributions to the Core made by Belknap, professor in the Slavic Languages and Literature Department, and Kuhns, professor emeritus of philosophy. Professor J. W. Smit, the Queen Wilhelmina Professor of the History, Language, and Literature of the Netherlands, received a special award in recognition of his accomplishment as the only professor to have taught the four Core Curriculum classes: Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. While the evening focused on celebrating the professors' achievements and the continued existence of the Core, both the speakers and honorees expressed their concerns about the future of the Core in the face of the College's expanding population. Michael Rosenthal, professor of English and Comparative Literature, spoke on the difficulties of staffing the Core Curriculum, which requires a large number of professors and instructors for all the class sections, which are capped at 22 students. ""No one before [Smit] has had the range, capacity, and commitment to teach all four [courses]... He is a man who has totally embodied and internalized the values of the Core,"" Rosenthal said. John Rosenberg, the William Peter field Trent professor ofEnglish and Comparative Literature, noting that students in his classes often have to go into other classrooms to find enough chairs, emphasized the need to cap the size of Core classes and his own concern over the expansion of the College. He also expressed concern over the increase in the number of sections of Core classes. 'This is wonderful from one perspective,"" he said. ""From another, it's the end of the collegiality of the staff,"" referring to the different levels of experience that Core preceptors and professors have. Smit also had concerns, particularly in connection with the expertise of instructors of the Core Curriculum saying that ""the question of whether we are serving our students as well"" should be examined."" Smit made a comparison to Pericles' funeral oration in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War when he said ""I think what we learn from those classical texts is how fast an ideal state can be changed.""He urged necessary planning for the future of Core Curriculum staffing before a true celebration of the Core Curriculum could be held. ""Only when we have made that decision do we have the right to celebrate being here together,"" Smit said. Quigley responded to these concerns and emphasized administrative awareness of staffing problems with the Core. Quigley said that as of now, the Administration is addressing concerns through an Endowment for the Core, an ongoing fundraising activity. He said the endowment will probably provide for approximately 10 Core chairs awarded on a rotating basis for fiveyear terms. Quigley was not surprised by the honorees' concerns. 'This is a conversation that goes on in the background all the time,"" he said. ""I was glad [to have] the opportunity to be able to address what we're doing."" Belknap received his Ph.D from Columbia in 1960. He served as director of the Russian Institute, now known as the Harriman Institute, from 1974-1977 and is anauthority on Dostoevsky. He currently teaches the Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and 19th Century Russian Drama courses, as well as Literature Humanities. Belknap has also published works analyzing plots in narrative and drama. Kuhns also received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1960. He specializes in aesthetics and has written on classical philosophy and drama. As a teacher of Literature Humanities as well, Kuhns is particularly interested in Apuleius' The Golden Ass and Boccaccio's The Decameron. Rosenberg observed that it was particularly appropriate that Kuhns and Belknap receive the award together. Kuhns and Belknap coauthored Tradition and Innovation, General Education and the Reintegration of the University in 1977. It covered, Rosenberg said, a time when the ""disintegration of the university and nation seemed a closer reality than reintegration."" Additionally, the two instituted a series of seminars in the 1970s on general education encompassing the different schools of the University.""Both have sustained their commitment to general education for over four decades,"" said Rosenberg. Director of the Heyman Humanities Center, Professor Wm. Theodore de Bary said that both professors have been ""identified long with not only the Core Curriculum and humanities courses but with the whole idea of generaleducation as exemplified by the Core Curriculum."" All the speakers praised the two professors' commitment to the Core Curriculum. ""We clearly owe a special debt to the faculty who have been dedicated to maintaining its vitality and excellence,"" Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen said.Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen, right, honored Professor Robert Belknap for his service to the Core Curriculum.Professor Emeritus Richard Kuhns, center, accepted his honor last night.

108,Art Humanities,CU Installs High-Tech Classrooms,16 November 2000,"BY JULIANNA GOLDMAN Spectator Staff Writer■ DVDs,VCRs, e-podiums enhance education but create new challenges.Students registering for classes this week are still able to refer to the hand-held Pencilbook, and Columbia College and Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences students cannot yet register for classes online. School-wide class selection at Columbia has yet to go hi-tech. But when they get to many classes, students find an ever-increasing level of technology that can either enhance or detract from their learning experience. Each year, the University spends $500,000 to improve classrooms around campus. Many of these upgrades add technological resources such as overhead projectors and DVD players to everything from large lecture halls to small seminar rooms. A professor in these ""e-class-rooms"" can use a touch screen —or ""e-podium""—to show a DVD, project an overhead, or control thelights in the classroom. In order to show a DVD, for example, a professor can touch one button on the podium, and the lights automatically dim, the screen comes down, and the DVD begins. Where professors once had to lug heavy tape recorders and VCRs to class, DVDs, screen projectors, and computers are now all standard in e-classrooms. The electronic classroom project began in 1994 and has been expanding since then, with six rooms added since January 2000. Throughout that time, the definition of ""e-classroom"" has changed greatly. ""What technology meant five years ago was basically a TV and a VCR in every room,"" said Joe leunuso, assistant vice president for facilities and financial administrative services. 'The definition of technology keeps changing,"" he said. Using this technology is not difficult, said Robert Cartolano, manager of academic technologies for Academic Information Systems. ""If you can use a bank machine, you can use this,"" he said, noting that professors are required to go through extensive training sessions to learn how to use the equipment. But even though the technology may be easy to use, integrating it successfully into a professor's teaching can prove more difficult. ""The technology has to enhance the teaching experience,"" lenuso said. Such technology, Professor of Psychology Robert Krauss said, often requires professors to alter their teaching methods. ""You find that you have to change teaching style to some extent, and you learn from experience."" Krauss taught in an e-classroom last year. Yet he still sees the electronic classroom as bringing great benefits to the learning experience. Learning how to use the e-podium, Krauss said, ""really takes time. [lt's]labor intensive, in a way that preparing for a lecture isn't."" ""For those of us who have learned how to use it effectively, I think it's terrific. [From] the feedback I get from the students, I find it helps, and makes the subject more accessible to them,"" he added. William Welch, CC 'O3, has Art Humanities in the e-classroom in 608 Schermerhorn. His professor, Anthony R. Scibilia, uses the projector on a regular basis. ""Having larg-er, higher quality projected images is much more effective than having photographs that are reprinted in a book,"" Welch said. ""When he is trying to describe a line, or a color, it is much easier if everyone's attention is focused on the front of the class, all looking at the same image, and not some small poorly reproduced image in a book on their desk,"" One significant benefit of classroom technology, Krauss said, is that it helps students understand specific concepts more easily. He said that his course in human communications especially benefits from the resources the e-classroom offers. ""A particular topic I teach in speech perception is very technical and requires understanding,"" Krauss said, adding that before the technology was available, his students ""never seemed to quite get it. And now I demonstrate it, and once I demonstrate it, I go over the explanation a second time and at that point they seem to understand it.""Jonathan Goldstein, CC 'O3, was in Professor Alan Brinkley's America Since 1945 class, taught in Altschul Auditorium, last semester. Goldstein remembers one lecture particularly because of Brinkley's use of the e-podium. He said that when the class discussed Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Why We Can't Wait, Brinkley showed King's ""1 Have a Dream"" speech. ""It really tied everything we were learning in class together and brought history into the classroom. It didn't seem like history, it almost seemed like a current event."" Yet with all of the advantages that the e-podium brings to the professors and to the students, some fear that with all the new resources, the learning environment may be compromised for the sake of technology. 'You have to resist the temptation of showing off and doing things just for effect,"" Krauss said. Some students are skeptical of the e-classroom idea. Matthew Fox, CC 'O3, said, 'Teaching should be a teacher lecturing their students trying to help them learn, rather than solely using a teaching aid to help them. Limited use of it is fine, but to put too much emphasis on it, I think is detrimental."" While Cartolano and lenuso agree with Krauss that technology can be misused, they also said that major advances in the ways in which technology is used in the classroom is necessary. ""Every room needs technology of some sort —that is where we will have to evolve,"" lenuso said. ""It is a question of growing and maintaining high quality service, and understanding what the faculty would like to do. We don't want to fit in technology for technology's sake,"" Cartolano said. Cartolano said one upcoming advance is the addition of wireless Internet technology in classrooms. With a wireless Internet connection, students will have a direct connection to the Internet right fromtheir seats during lectures, which will enable the student to follow a professor's demonstration on the Internet. But wireless Internet access would also allow students to check their e-mail, send instant messages, and check online sports scores from class. ""Its very hard for an instructor to develop rapport with students,"" Krauss said. ""And by the end of thesemester I am lucky if I can recognize the faces of 90 percent of the students in the class. You don't need things that reduce the rapport."" Another factor to consider when debating e-classrooms is what happens if the technology fails. ""It's not that technology doesn't break. It does,"" lenuso said. ""And it always breaks at the most inoppor-tune time."" Krauss attests to this. ""When it works, it's great. It was better last year than the year before. Initially it was not at all unusual to work for three days preparing a presentation and the computer wouldn't boot up or the projector wouldn't work,"" he said. Psychology Professor Lois Putnam, who teaches in an e-class-room, agreed. Two years ago, she lost 40 percent of her lectures because of equipment problems one semester. ""I think of [the e-class-room] as an airplane because you can reach heights that you would never reach without it, but when it crashes, it crashes like it has never crashed before,"" Putnam said. But Cartolano still sees the epodium as being truly beneficial to the students and the professors. ""As more and more faculty use [the epodium], requests will rise,"" he said. The e-classroom, he added, ""Sharpens and enhances instruction [so] technology fades into the background and lets what the teacher is trying to teach come out.""

109,Art Humanities,Art Hum Revisited Extracurricular activity in the City of Seven Hills,24 January 2001,"Extracurricular activity in the City of Seven HillsBy Emily Morris Spectator Art EditorAfter wasting away in Dallas for two weeks, I couldn't take any more home-cooked meals or lazy mornings of sleeping in, so I hopped on a jet and flew away into the sunrise. Destination: Rome. Land of la dolce vita, the sweet life, Rome is where cherubs spew into fountains, where the Coliseum is a block away from Mussolini's monument to himself, and where the authority of fashion is equaled only by the authority of the Pope.Within the first few minutes of arriving in Rome, I found myself in the chapel Santa Maria della Vittoria. Positioned along the route from the stazione to the hotel, it sits inconspicuously on the corner of a square, dwarfed by a larger chapel across the way and ignored by the people constantly flowing in and out of the coffee bar down the street. One would never know that the unassuming and unmarked chapel housed Gianlorenzo Bernini's ultimate masterpiece, the Ecstasy of St. Theresa. Walking inside, the chapel seemed more a function of life than art; old women kneeled with bowed heads, and working men stopped by on their way home. My cumbersome suitcase seemed a light load compared to the weary faces of the congregation; the people appeared as old as the marble. The fact that Bernini's art is housed there didn't faze the priests administering communion. In fact, I wouldn't haveeven noticed the Ecstasy of St. Theresa unless I had walked around the entire periphery of the chapel, as the sculpture is recessed along the left wing of the transept and not visible from the chapel's entrance. A small altar set up on a table in the corner of the chapel by the Ecstasy of St. Theresa was draped with bright red cloth and gold tinsel with a light shining upon the plastic figure within. This gaudy setup got more attention than St. Theresa, who was neglected by all except the angel poised above her.Bernini's other great works, such as Apollo and Daphne and Jupiter and Persephone, are in the magnificent Galleria Borghese, a shining white building on the summit of one of the Borghese Park's hills featuring a long line of tourists waiting to buy tickets. People reverently circled the statues, pointing out Persephone's toes or Daphne's vine-like hair in various languages, being careful not to breach the unspoken code of museum silence. The sculptures were surprisingly lifelike; they glowed in the museum lighting and truly seemed as if they were people frozen in midmotion and relegated to marble forever. When Bernini's work is compared to the other statues in the museum, which are significantly cruder and less imaginative, his inclusion in the Art Humanities curriculum seems especially valid. A young German hooligan provided comic relief by invading the velvet ropes and attempting to scale thepedestal of Bernini's David to the dismay of the museum guards. The Vatican is even more dramatic than the Galleria Borghese. The muted whispers in the Borghese were replaced by an eerie silence, broken only by footsteps in the Vatican. Tourists milled about with awed expressions. Crowds adorned with fanny packs and cameras crowded around Michelangelo's Pieta while priests hurried about with a look of concentration upon their faces. The Vatican museum, including the Sistine Chapel, is only open for three hours each morning. Their closing foiled my first attempts to infiltrate the museum. The doors shut exactly at noon and apparently flipped a meteorological switch. Rain started pouring down upon the unsheltered tourist; perhaps God was in league with the sternfaced museum guards. Returning at the ungodly hour of 9 a.m., more crowds of tourists milled around with looks of stupor on their faces—caused either by the early hour or the sheer amount of religion that pressed in from every side, even from the ceiling and floors. Moving from chamber to chamber, angels, Madonnas, saints, and sinners are represented thousands of times over in gold, paint, clay, marble, and even in a certain medium that looked suspiciously like macaroni. The sheer density of the environment propels visitors from one room to the next, as if it is too much to just stand in one place for longer than a few minutes. I walked past Raphael's School of Athens the first time I passed through, hurrying to make the train and not realizing that Raphael's frescoes were different from those in the dozens of other rooms I walked through. In my defense, however, the School of Athens is not in the direct line of sight as I followed the arrows pointing to the Sistine Chapel. When walking back through (my Art Hum teacher will be ashamed to know), I almost missed Raphael's frescoes a second time. The presence of a large group of young female tourists who were all wearing red ribbons in their hair was the only factor that prevented me from noticing I was again in the presence of true greatness.Raphael's fresco is painted into the walls of a room that initially seems to be merely another decorated passageway in the labyrinthine maze of the museum. Nothing distinguishes the room from the hundreds of others except for Raphael's distinctive touch.Raphael differentiated himself by composing a painting with a non-Christian theme; the Vatican is the last place one would expect to see an ode to Classical philosophy and thought rather than Christian morals and ideals. Yet the School of Athens preserves the overall sanctity of the Vatican, and was only slightly compromised by the chattering ribbonwearers. As if to excuse his breach in Catholic subject matter, directly across the room is Raphael's other masterpiece, Disputa, which isentirely focused upon a Catholic subject: the sacrament of communion. Michalangelo's Sistine Chapel culminated the trip. The Chapel is the crown jewel of the Vatican Palace. Arrows throughout the museum herd the visitors toward"
110,Art Humanities,Where's the Money?,25 January 2001,"The Weissing on the Cake By Kike WeissColumbia University just completed a $2.8 billion fundraising campaign. Hmm. And none of my friends can get into any of their classes. Junior and senior years at Columbia traditionally involve a movement away from the core curriculum into more specialized classes within their range of interests. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations are replaced by 4000-level classes like Post-Pre-Industrial Colonization and its Raphaelite Transgender Affirmation of the American Male in (hyper) Popular and Non-Specific Anti-Culture. (I haven't taken it; I hear it's all Teaching Assistants.) Lectures are replaced by seminars, graduate students are replaced by actual professors, and everyone is meant to begin a beautiful two-year period of general enlightenment. The only problem is, of course, that all the classes are full. Anything that sounds interesting has been pre-pre-registered for, with students buttering up their prospective professors months before registration. Lists of hopeful students are compiled, wait lists develop, and suddenly we have created a twice-annual expectation that all students must stand in intellectual bread lines, waiting for their esteemed professors to hand them the sustenance that they crave deep down in unspeakable parts of the human psyche next to recipes for pot brownies and Wilson Phillips lyrics. So where has this $2.8 billion injection into our already cushy endowment gone? We have a new student center that came in a scant $26 million over-budget. The sod on South Lawn is replaced every couple of months, and it remains green for about two and a half days, until the South American Amateur Soccer League hears that its field has been repaired. Lions Court is still made out of corrugated metal, and it is still destroying the campus's claim to aesthetic pride. There should be plenty of leftover cash. Why haven't new professors been hired? The English department is not crowded. There is plenty of room for more professors. No one would object. Why is it that when $3 billion are raised, classes are still shutting students out at record rates? Shouldn't hiring new professors be the very first expenditure for a school that has just successfully raised more money than anyone could ever be expected to count? Of course, I could be just another radical peacenik speaking off the cuff and tellin' it like it is. Money is wasted at this school by the truckload. We throw parties every night of the week in Low Rotunda, and I have yet to be invited. Not once. George Rupp's bi-monthlytrip to the beauty salon? Columbia picks up the tab. Granite-and marble-stud our campus, their expense belied by their inability to offer traction in slippery conditions. And granite and marble do not come cheap. Lions. They are two of the most expensive rocks on the market, coming in just after The Rock. It costs $35,000 to go to this college, a price tag that increases at about a 2.5 to 3.0 percent rate, never mind that the inflation rate over the past ten years has hovered at about 1.2 percent. What does that mean, all you nonecon majors? It means that it is damn expensive to go to this school. A lot of parents would be shocked to learn that during their children's first two years at Columbia College, they were taught by graduate students in Lit Hum, C.C., Logic and Rhetoric, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. It's not necessarily a waste of money to have a professor-free college education; but then again watching Road Rules and The Real World compete in a tattoo contest in Park City, Utah isn't a complete waste of time either. Which is to say that it, is a waste of money to attend a college where it is more difficult to take a class with an actual professor than it is to receive an A.' Two point eight billion American dollars. The possibilities are endless. They're difficult to imagine. Columbia could buy its own XFL team, the New York Teaching Assistants. We could fund a program to teach undergraduates and high school students how to teach college classes, to free up busy graduate students who are composing their theses on Formations of Sexual Identity: Pre-Acculturalized Art and Artifact in Post-Radio Indochina. We could hire Emeril Lagasse to be the chef de cuisine at John Jay Dining Hall. (""You left your card in your dorm room? BAM! You need your card there brother, BAM!!!"") All ""zany"" ""off-beat"" ideas aside, Columbia University should hire more degree-bearing, actual professors. To teach classes. It's a simple concept, something I've been working on over the past few weeks. I believe that upperclassmen have earned a class or two that wasn't taught by a wet-behind-the-ears, jumpy, unprofessional, whiny, incompetent graduate student who can't find the remote control to turn off the lights so that he can show the class a riveting video covering the mating habits of poisonous tree frogs and their analogous place in a feminist understanding of the worker's representation in print media. More professors is a simple, good idea.Mike Weiss is a Columbia College junior majoring in English and Comparative Literature."
111,Art Humanities,Editorial Journal by Adam B. Kushner Unions Undermine Education,29 March 2001,"Unions Undermine EducationOn university campuses nationwide, the discussion continues over whether or not graduate students should have the right to unionize on campus. At issue is what a graduate student union might mean for the undergraduate students of Columbia. Unions hold the power to undermine the undergraduate education by striking and drawing other resources for the university. The Graduate Student Employees United (GSEU) has a motto: ""Columbia works because we do."" There is no doubt graduate student instructors play an integral role in the instruction of Core Curriculum classes like Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. Additionally, Columbia's lecture classes could not operate without the graduate teaching assistants who help to run them But because graduate students are so involved, a graduate student strike at Columbia —a very real possibility with unionization —could cripple nearly all of the requisite undergraduate curricula. If Core class instructors were to stop instructing, the Core would not work; a two-week strike might set an undergraduate's course of study back by an entire semester, postponing graduation orthe completion of a major. Imagine the potential undergraduate outcry that would ensue, calling for a refund in tuition, or an exemption from one or more of Columbia's Core classes. Additionally, a union will allow its members to bargain with the University about the number of hours they work each week. Though this could improve the lifestyles of Columbia's graduate students, it could also detract from the work —both inside and outside of the classroom —that instructors and teaching assistants would put into class preparation. Bargaining over hours could affect the quality of in-class instruction if instructors were not required to put in the appropriate amount of work for a section. While presenting a unified front against the University would certainly give graduate students leverage in negotiations for better pay and other benefits, graduate instructors and teaching assistants must not forget their importance to the continuity of undergraduate education. At a university like this, where such dependence is inevitable and irrefutable, the Administration and the graduate students must come to an arrangement by which they will not endanger this university's educational mission."
112,Art Humanities,"Ladies of the MET, East Village Style",26 September 2001,"By Vanessa Lau Columbia Daily SpectatorBeginning Sept. 7, the men and women of the fashion world descended upon Bryant Park to exhibit, discover, and record the spring 2002 collections of New York's Fashion Week. While the rest of the city begins to shop for fall sweaters and jackets, some 85 designers presented their visions for next season's major trends to roughly 80 television crews, 600 photographers, editors from more than 250 publications, and hundreds of private retailers. So what did this world that runs the spectrum from wrap dresses and bonsai prints (Diane Von Furstenberg) to graffiti in Day-Glo colors (Stephen Sprouse) have to do with the staples of Art Humanities, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin and Renaissance artist Bergognone? Two words and one designer: Mark Montano.His Sunday show, titled ""Women of the Metropolitan,"" begins to the blaring tune of Pavarotti's ""La Donna e Mobile"" as we watch a model's silhouette fanning herself beneath his signature up on the wall. The music intensifies into the beat of techno music, the lights brighten, and the model finally sashays out onto the catwalk. She wears a tight-fitting yellow silk bodice and an organza aqua and red striped skirt. He has copied Degas' The Singer in Green to a T, even adorning her neck with the exact ribbon choker as the figure in the painting. Another model follows and another after that. This time they are his ballerinas, in costumes oflight greens, whites, and creams, with sashes around their waist just like the paintings depict them. These are the dancers of Degas, portrayed detail for detail; the pastels and oils of the artist transformed into fabrics of crinoline, lace, silk, and chiffon. Lest his garments be called mereimitations, questioning the creativity involved in their making, Montano provides a cascade of designs that pull these women out of the world of art history and into the world of contemporary fashion. He pairs fishnet stockings with 18th century gowns and dresses, slashes the sleeves of Georges de la Tour's The Penitent Magdalen and raises her hemline without incurring the discordant sight of Mary Magdalen in a micro-mini. Montano loosens the feel of the cloth, changing the heavy puritan ensemble of Degas' Portrait of a Woman in Gray into an airy summer dress of cotton gauze and silk chiffon. Colors abound in light iridescent hues: fuchsia, periwinkle, and sunset gold, among others. He has made these women sexy, with off-the-shoulder, form-fit-ting numbers. A frumpy nightgown (Edouard Manet's Young Lady) becomes a stunning opera coat, and the robes of the Madonna in Bergognone's The Assumption of the Virgin, a red silk dress. Even men become women: Bronzino's Portrait of a Young Man appears as a model in a black shirt dress which maintains the ruffled choker collar of the painting, and Picasso's Harlequin with a Glass now wears a corsetedgown down the catwalk. The audience can't help but take delight in the cleverness of Mark Montano's sense of adaptation. I found that to be the case when he went a step further in blurring the boundaries between art, fashion, and representation and used actual canvas and paint as the base fabric for his designs. We are no longer speaking along the same lines as Moschino's trompe I'oeil ink drawings of laces, buttons, and seams on this season's shoes, coats, and bags, but of a fleshing out of paintings and a flatteningof garments into canvas. Take, for example, Gauguin's Two Tahitian Women. Montano has created clothes from clothes, but how is he able to do that with a painting of nude figures? The result is a short, sleeveless dress made of cotton canvas that bears near the front a painting of women's breasts; he has literally taken the body of Gauguin's left nude and reproduced it as apparel with the aid of artist Hannah Lew. The most wild design of his collection follows suit: Gustave Moreau's Oedipus and the Sphinx is replicated in a dress of the same cut as the previous one but with one excep-tion-there is a right sleeve that opens up into a bird's wing. Montano has taken the two elements of the painting and merged them into one outfit; the bare breastof Oedipus is painted on the canvas dress, as is the spread wing of the Sphinx. One can easily get lost in the ideas his collection seems to be presenting and of the porous boundaries between art and fashion. Artists may have been the inspiration for many a designer this year — Degas for Armani, ToulouseLautrec for Versace, and Girard for Anna Sui—but Montano has truly literalized this concept. No longer does a painter's canvas have to lie flat against a museum wall. Now it can wrap itself around the human body as fabric while still functioning as an instrument of display. Montano's show, however, becomes more than that and the bringing to life of paintings and past figures. With the playful wink of a model who turns on the catwalk and thewhimsical sight of these women taking up the melodramatic gestures of the paintings, Montano keeps his presentation and his clothes lighthearted and fun. As with all other events in this eight-day period of fashion, style, and the hottest trends, when the curtain falls we must ask ourselves what we have walked away with. With Mark Montano we learn that clothes can be entertaining and inspired, classic yet hip; that ruffles, lace lining, and everything feminine are in; that the 80s are out and replaced by the women of the Metropolitan, and that there is such a thing as downtown couture and museum chic. The Mark Montano Store and Showroom is located at 434 E. 9th St.No longer does a painter's canvas have to lie flat against a museum wall."

114,Art Humanities,V&T's Fixes Health Code Violations After Closing,31 January 2002,"By Felice Bajoras Spectator Staff WriterHealth Dept. cited restaurant for a faulty gas pipe and other concerns.Popular Italian restaurant i V&T's closed for four days last weekend to fix health code violations the New York City Department of Health had cited in November. The eatery, located at 1024 Amsterdam Ave. between 110 th and 111 th St. was cited for five health violations on Nov. 5, 2001: a food protection certificate was not held by the owner, food was spoiled, canned food products were observed leaking, the gas pipe was faulty, and vermin were present in the food storage. According to Health Dept. reports, many of these findings are common among restaurants and sound worse than they actually are. The gas pipe, however, need-Ed to be fixed immediately. ""Our waste pipe was over 50 years old,"" store manager Aler Gjolaj said. 'The problem needed to be taken care of immediately. So we closed for a few days."" Residents walking by noticed the closed sign on the door and assumed the restaurant was going out of business. The Italian restaurant, known for pizza so messy it requires a knife and fork to eat, opened Sept. 11, 1945, and has always been popular with the Morningside Heights community. The shutdown was the pizzeria's first since a fire seven years ago. ""I've eaten there since the good old days,"" said Mary D. Edwards, former Art Humanities professor and now a teacher at Pratt. ""I've always considered it to be the best pizza in the neighborhood. This news makes me wonder retroactively what's been in my stomach all these years."" The restaurant is making cosmetic improvements, as well. Recently, it opened an outdoor seating area to compete with its neighbor, the Hungarian Pastry Shop, and to allow its patrons ""to eat and pray while looking at the beautiful cathedral,"" said Gjolaj. He assured neighborhood residents that the restaurant is safe and hopes to remain open for another 56 years. Upon reflecting that the owners closed down in order to remedy the situation, Edwards said, ""I'll definitely go back. It's the best pizza around!"" V&T frequenter Hannah Tran, CC 'O4, said that even though V&T is not closed permanently, she is not too eager to return in light of its numerous health violations. ""Well, I wasn't crazy about the food to begin with, but now I definitely wouldn't go back. Health violations are a no-no in my dining options book,"" Tran said.V. & T.

116,Art Humanities,Staff Editorial Art for Art's Sake An Art Hum exemption test would benefit students and faculty.,23 October 2002,"Art for Art's SakeAn Art Hum exemption test would benefit students and faculty.Columbia College prides itself on the Core Curriculum. The Core asks students to take courses that, in many cases, they may not otherwise choose. Students thus graduate from the College with a broad, shared academic background in the studies of art, music, science, foreign languages and cultures, and the humanities. The College makes exceptions for students to test out of the languages and Music Humanities, and should offer an Art Humanities exemption exam as well. Students proficient in a foreign language have the option of taking an exemption exam. Similarly, students with an adequate background in music can test out of Music Humanities; roughly 50 percent of the 60-odd students who take the music exemption test each year pass. A similar exam for Art Humanities is an important option. Some students arrive at Columbia with high marks in AP Art History or with an otherwise considerable exposure to the arts, and should be exempt from the course. Art Humanities is a useful course because it provides a general introduc-tion to art history and art criticism and teaches students to consider art in new ways. The limited class size generates a healthy discussion atmosphere. Unfortunately, as a small and required course, the class size puts an undue strain on the Art History department—especially given the recent enlargement of the College. Allowing some students to test out of the course would ease the pressures that the department faces. More importantly, the exemption option would eliminate what is an unnecessary inconvenience for some students. It is difficult for students to fulfill the Core's extensive requirements while pursuing such undertakings as study abroad, multiple majors or concentrations, internships, and extracurricular activities. Those who have no need for the basic Art Humanities instruction should not spend their time taking the course. Though the Core experience is crucial, there are other aspects of college life that deserve priority. If a student is qualified to test out of Art Humanities, he or she should have the option."
117,Art Humanities,"Aix Marks the Spot News French addition gambles, raises the bar for Upper West Side Dining",11 November 2002,"News French addition gambles, raises the bar for Upper West Side DiningBy Ben Falik Columbia Food EditorAix is a gamble. The success -of Ouest as an upscale, upper-West Side newcomer restaurant was like counting cards at a blackjack table. Just because the right cards had come up so far, it didn't mean that Aix was going to turn out an ace. Last month, Aix opened its doorsto a different group of diners, often elusive in the neighborhood. The way things look so far, it's hard to imagine this beautiful bistro busting. Bright acrylic-painted sculpture people greet patrons at the door. The figures—l think the Art Humanities term would be extreme impasto—are misleading in twoways. For one, the color scheme of the multi-level, mirror-filled dining room is far more uniform, with deep reds and yellows. Also, the animate staff is far more beautiful, similar to the contrast between the white flatware pictured on the menu and the intricate dishes that arrived throughout the meal. Jack, our sharp-like-an-aspiring-actor waiter, first brought a Mojito and Leffe —the best of Cuba and Belgium, respectively—along with a basket of warm bread. Warm bread might not seem like much, but it's an important little detail. Many of your most expensive establishments treat bread like a throwaway, cold and crumbly. Aix seems to know what kind of a first impression the staple can make. My Tuna Carpaccio ($l2) was woven in and out of sliced cucumber in a grid pattern. The two main ingredients made for a perfect cut with a fork, and the textures came together behind a horseradish kick. The Tomato Tart ($9) proved a hearty vegetarian choice. The flaky crust surrounded a tomato that reminds us just how much flavor that wanna-be veggie can have when it is picked and cooked properly. The woman at the next table had two pieces of advice for me. One, take her abnormal psych class next semester. Two, get the Lobster (MP). Lobster is a big deal of a meal that always comes with high expectations. This meaty offering, peeking out from beneath a hill of green beans and atop a basmati rice cake, was as exceptional as a bottom feeder can be. If her understanding of the mind is half as good as her appreciation for fine seafood, that might be a class to look into. As good as the Venison ($2B) was—and it was great—the supporting cast stole the show. Next to the medallions of tender game was aquince-beet strudel, a profound pastry that wowed my guest, an admitted beet dissenter. Not wanting her world thrown into flux, I took it upon myself to eat the rest of it, in addition to the six root vegetable puree, which had a subtle mastery of its own. The fruity Muscat ($8) probably would have been enough to cap off the meal on its own, but the dessert descriptions were like poetry and demanded our attention. Neither the Chocolate Banana Tart ($9) nor the Pineapple Ricotta Cake ($9) had an overpowering sweetness. Each had help in that department, with flavored flan and ice cream to share fork fulls. Waiting patiently on the corner of each plate was candied fennel, a natural breath freshener and digestive aid. The card that really brought the Aix to 21, however, was the least expected—the ace when all you hoped for was a jack. I noticed it come with someone else's check and asked the waiter. He looked at me as though I had just guessed that Bruce Willis's character in The Sixth Sense is dead throughout the movie. The French name is Barbapapa, which translates as ""grandfather's whiskers"" and exemplifies Aix's playful sense of chi-chi. I'd tell you what it is, but the dealer has to keep at least one card face down. Aix is located at 88th Street and Broadway. 212-874-7400.Intricate dishes, a rich interior, and a beautiful staff define Aix, a memorable dining experience."
118,Art Humanities,Core Journal to Be Published Next Spring,23 September 2003,"By Morgan Sellers Columbia Daily Spectator■ The new journal will include exemplary student essays written for Core classesOvadia Labaton, CC 'O5, was sitting in the Core Curriculum office last fall, trying to switch his section of Contemporary Civilization, when he asked Professor Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum, if anyone had ever attempted to anthologize students' papers from Core classes. She said that no serious effort had ever been made. Now, Labaton is the editor-in-chief of the Core Journal, a new annual publication on campus that will highlight superior literary and scholarly work that Columbia students have done for the Core. ""The numbers are compelling.... There are thousands of kids per year taking Literature Humanities, and thousands taking CC. Even if only one percent are writing good papers, that's hundreds of papers. You can't even print that many,"" Labaton said. But Labaton also wants the journal to be more than just a showcase of student work. He aims to create an ""intellectual history"" of the Core.""We're trying to create an intergenerational dialogue and place current Core papers in a greater context,"" he said. ""The journal can be a time capsule, showing what texts were used and what people were saying about them. Papers change as the world changes"" The Core Journal has plans to publish annually, with three to five papers included for each Core course: Lit Hum, CC, Logic & Rhetoric (or University Writing), Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Major Cultures courses. Labaton intends to find out if there are any assignments in the new Science Frontiers Core course that would lend themselves to such a publication. ""If there's writing in it, and especially if there's a fusion of science and philosophy, or other aspects of the Core, then we'll absolutely include it,"" Labaton said. Recent requests for submissions have gone out in e-mails from the class centers and student government In the future, the journal will ask instructors of Core classes torecommend individual papers for publication, as well as announce submission deadlines in their courses. The board is also hoping to get papers from upperclassmen. The journal has a submissions box in the Core office, and it is also accepting submissions through email at corejournal@columbia.edu. The deadline is Oct 3 at 5 p.m. The executive board members—Eva Gardner, CC 'O4; Rebecca Weber, CC 'O5; and Labaton —are in the process of selecting an editorial board from a pool of more than 70 applications. Student response to the journal is varied, perhaps based on experiences with the Core itself. Emily Kadish, CC 'O6, is anxious to read the first issue of the journal. ""I'm a Core junkie,"" she said. ""There are so many people that complain about it, so it's nice that some people admit to liking it in long, written form."" Cara Rachele, CC 'O5, was somewhat skeptical. She claimed that papers written for Core classes are not representative of college work.""The Core produces a lot of bad writing,"" she said. ""If [the essays] really were the best things that came out of the Core, then that would be interesting, but I wouldn't assume that."" But it is that same idea that the Core Journal is hoping to combat. ""If someone who didn't like their CC class picks up the journal and reads a really great CC paper, maybe it will inspire them,"" Gardner said. The three executive board members already have a lot of experience in on-campus publications. Gardner is currently the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Literary Criticism, and Weber holds the same role at the Columbia Political Review.But the three intend the Core Journal to target a broader audience than other undergraduate literary publications on campus. As Labaton pointed out, the papers would be ""in the context of the Core. [The journal] is about the intellectual history and currents of the Core. I hope there will be great literary research, but we're looking at a much wider topic range. Every undergrad in the College, and even some in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, can relate to this."" The journal has received some funding from the office of Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis, and it will apply for the President's and Provosfs Fund, which provides finances for first-time activities that benefit a significant portion of the undergraduate student body. Also, the journal is in the process of applying for recognition by the Activities Board at Columbia. In the next few years, the executive board also hopes to send copies of the journal to prospective students. And they would like to ask distinguished alumni to write reflections on their experiences with various classes.Currently, the only official support being provided by the Core office is the submissions box. However, Gillooly indicated that if the students asked for any editorial or technical assistance, she would do all that she could, saying, ""Student involvement, energy, and ideas should be supported wherever they can be. What I love about the Core is that all these minds are thinking about the same thing at the same time, and [the journal] will lead to even greater sharing of ideas."" - The journal's executive editors hope to publish the first issue in February, a deadline that Gardner called ""ambitious.""'[The journal] is about the intellectual history and currents of the Core.' —Ovadia Labaton, CC 'O5 Editor, Core Journal'We're trying to create an intergenerational dialogue and place current Core papers in context.' —Labaton"
119,Art Humanities,"Art Autumn Landscape, Circa 1860",22 October 2003,"Autumn Landscape, Circa 1860By Thomas Quick Columbia Daily SpectatorCan't get upstate to see the leaves turn? Head to Fifth Avenue instead to see the grand autumnal landscape paintings of Sanford R. Gifford and George Inness, on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Academy of Design, respectively. These artists shared the influence of the Hudson River School, a movement inspiredby the heroic wilderness landscapes of Thomas Cole and further shaped by the use of nature studies. As a comparison of their work illustrates, however, Gifford and Inness's conceptions of the American landscape diverged considerably. ""Hudson River School Visions: The Landscapes of Sanford R. Gifford"" introduces viewers to Gifford's work with Lake Nemi (1856-57). This striking landscape reflects the influence both of heroic yet scientifically accurate Hudson River School painting and of the lightfilled seascapes of the British painter J. M. W. Turner. Sunlight bathes the tops of the botanically correct trees in golden hues and covers the entire landscape in a brilliant haze, transforming a frequently painted Italian subject into a truly visionary work.This effect of light became a hallmark of Gifford's style, but he employed other techniques as well. The cool palette of A Coming Storm (1863), with its contrasting, fiery orange highlights, is a radical departure from the warmth of his earlier pictures, a change that may reflect his grief at his brother's death in the Civil War. Hunter Mountain, Twilight (1866) evokes a similar mood in its depiction of aformer battlefield littered with splintered tree stumps bathed not in golden light, but in somber deep red glazes. In his later work, Gifford often abandoned the attention to detail characteristic of the Hudson River School; instead, he concentrated on the intangible atmosphere that had been the strongest quality of his paintings since Lake Nemi. The role of atmosphere as subject matter will startle Art Humanities studentsin Ruins of the Parthenon (1880), in which the temple is subordinated to a view of the distant sea. Gifford said that this painting, which he considered his finest work, was ""not a picture of a building but a picture of a day."" ""George Inness and the Visionary Landscape,"" which is curated by Adrienne Baxter Bell, a Columbia Ph.D candidate, focus-es on the manifestation in Inness's painting of his Swedenborgian religious beliefs and Jamesian philosophical convictions. Despite this focus, the viewer will be struck by the variety of styles and moods of Inness's work in comparison to the relative continuity of Gifford's vision. The range of styles in Inness's 50-year career can perhaps be attributed to his artistic self-edu-cation, which left him without a single master to imitate. A bit of the Roman Aqueduct (1852) shows his imitation of the classically ordered landscapes of the great 17th-centu-ry French landscape painter Claude Lorrain, while the precise, vibrant Clearing Up (1860) represents the careful study of nature practiced by the Hudson River School.In the early 1860s, Inness reacted against the objectivity of the Hudson River School with subjective emotional responses to nature such as the ecstatic Evening Landscape (1862). As Gifford did, Inness unified the composition with the light of an intense orange sunset, which shines through a silhouetted row of trees. He also departed from the exacting detail of Clearing Up, instead applying paint thickly and in broad brushstrokes. The majority of paintings in the exhibition are from the last 10 years of Inness's life. The loose brushwork of the early 1860s returns in Inness's late work, creating ambiguities which encourage close examination and a spiritual response to nature. The autumnal subject simply entitled Landscape (1888) combines open brushwork and rich color in a harmonious composition that reaches back to the early influence of Lorrain. Inness's last paintings are thinly painted and tend to look unfinished,but they are among his greatest; their simplicity of design and the softness of their forms inspire a contemplative approach completely different than the response elicited by much of his earlier work. The Home of the Heron (1893) is subdued in color, yet the irregular regularity of the thin, dark tree trunks that emerge from its murky gloom has an uncanny hypnotic power. Having looked at nature through Inness's eyes, once you step out of the National Academy of Design, Central Park will amaze you. ""The Landscapes of Sanford R. Gifford"" is on view through Feb. 8 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; ""George Inness and the Visionary Landscape"" is on view through Dec. 28 at the National Academy of Design on Fifth Avenue at 90th Street."
120,Art Humanities,Your Mother's Diary Revealed,1 December 2003,"By Victoria Loustalot Columbia Daily SpectatorWhat Catcher in the Rye did for high school youths troubled by the onslaught of adulthood, H.T. Hamann's Anthropology of an American Girl does for college women struggling to reconcile their dreams with reality. Chronicling the life of artist Eveline from her last days wandering the halls of high school through her navigation of New York City and college, it's the story of your mother, sister, aunt, or best friend, of you, and even of that ass clown in Art Humanities. And while few women could read this book without finding multiple parallels to their own lives, it remains an acquired taste. The novel opens in June 1984 at a party in New York. Eveline is there, but more as an observer than an actual guest. Eveline's stilted conversations and her brief flight to the bathroom —when her boyfriend Mark dances with a redhead named Amy—reveal that she is out of place, an awkward 20-something whom the other partygoers gingerly acknowledge, but otherwise ignore. At a mere five pages, this introduction seems to pity Eveline, but its vagueness causes confusion. The reader does not know who Mark or even Eveline is. Their jobs and lifestyles are omitted, in favor of paragraph after paragraph of Eveline's misery and loneliness. Abruptly, the introduction ends, and the narration sends the reader back in time to autumn 1979, during Eveline's senior year of high school. The focus shifts from a depressed adult Eveline to a depressed teenage Eveline. Here Eveline's depression is more obvious because it exists in direct opposition to the portrayal of her graceful and beautiful best friend Kate. And while it is soon revealed that Kate's life has been less than perfect, even Kate's losses affect Eveline more tangibly than Kate herself. The rest of the novel follows suit as Eveline dwells on events that do not directly involve her. Since the book is written almost as a journal, you have to ask yourself whether or not you want to read 568 pages of your diary, or your mother's. As Hamann herself admitted inan interview, 'This story isn't sugarcoated."" Yet assuming you aren't suicidal, and can appreciate the sort of writing that makes an art of self-congratulation, you will find this book an experience. There is no passive reading when sentences read like short stories: 'To stop the feeling I had of falling sideways off my seat, I made a picture in my head of what it was to be Ellen Carnevale of the übiquitous E.S.C. monogram, charging up to Grand Central to catch the 7:55 to Rye, popping into Zaro's Bread Basket and ordering with a certainty that was enviable and supreme a choco-late croissant or a toasted raisin bagel and a coffee —no, not a coffee, she would want to nap—a fresh-squeezed juice—before picking up a few magazines to breeze through on the train as she anticipated the luxuries that awaited her at home, Jacuzzis and tuna salad with fresh dill."" The book is an exhausting history. For truly, it is a history, set in Manhattan, New Jersey, and East Hampton. Eveline is raised in the Hamptons, as was Hamann, who spent her childhood shuttling back and forth between her father in the Bronx and her mother in Long Island. Hamann, like Eveline, fled to New York City for college, attending New York University. The novel is clearly a history heavily influenced by Hamann's own path, but it is the emotions, the reactions of Eveline to her experiences, that readers will recognize. It is impossible not to be impressed by Hamann's flawless portrayal of a woman's journey toward gratification. But, as is evident from American Girl, this journey is about as idyllic as Ethan's life in Ethan Frome. Yet the difference between Ethan Frome and American Girl is that while Ethan's life is nauseatingly heartrending in its cruelly accurate depiction of poverty and people who do not have the luxury of choice,American Girl is poignantly devastating because it is your life. And frankly, living this life provides more than enough challenges; one doesn't need to read about it too. Perhaps for the girl whose life has played like a series of satisfying dominoes tipping in the right direction, Hamann's novel will be a modern Jane Eyre—a stunning novel to be read and reread, but whose Jane is living a life entirely alien. But truth be told, Anthropology of an American Girl is an upsetting, if beautiful, reminder of reality."
121,Art Humanities,Why Is the Core Curriculum So Eurocentric?,5 April 2004,"By Julie Carson Columbia Daily SpectatorThe debate over Eurocentrism in the Core Curriculum has never been hotter. Since its beginnings in 1918, the Core has drawn primarily on Western tradition to educate Columbia students. But after the recent protests on the steps of Low Library, which resulted in a group of students presenting University President Lee Bollinger with a set of demands that included a re-exami-nation of the Core with an eye toward its lack of diversity, we may be seeing changes to even the most fundamental Core courses. But still, there is no consensus on whether the Core should teach primarily Western tradition or incorporate non-Western and modern material as well. The main criticisms focus on the Core's lack of non-European texts and its alleged failure to address contemporary issues. Questioning the Core is far from a recent phenomenon. Its history has seen constant experimentation and overhaul, with a re-evaluation of class syllabi every two years. The Core introduced the Major Cultures requirement in 1989, while a course devoted to contemporary cultural issues disappeared. These reassessments have dealt with the perennial challenge of not diluting a coherent curriculum while still responding to an increasingly multicultural student body and cultural environment. Supporters of the current Core hope that the major departments will allow students to pursue a focus on contemporary or nonWestern cultural studies. But recent events on campus, including the Affirmative Action Bake Sale and the controversial Fed cartoon, have led some students to band together and demand that contemporary cultural analysis not be optional in the Core. Skirting contemporary studies, they claim, does not provide Columbia's student body with knowledge and awareness of racial and gender oppression. Student leaders proposed to President Bollinger the creation of a Core class to address ""issues of power and oppression in the United States, the process of racialization and the ideology of gender."" Their proposal recommended that a panel reassess the relevance of the Core to contemporary issues of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation.As for the integration of nonWestern material into the Core, one of the main obstacles is avoiding the appearance of tokenism, according to Classics Professor James Zetzel. Tokenism occurs when professors attempt to incorporate non-Western texts to serve only as a counterpoint to the Western canon, rather than analyzing them in their own context. The 1988 report of the Commission of the Core Curriculum headed by Professor Emeritus Wm. Theodore deßary found just this problem: an attempt to avoid Eurocentrism resulted in what was deemed a tokenistic use of non-European material. Tokenism, the report claimed, resulted from the syllabus' predominantly European content and from the unfamiliarity of many instructors with the material. The Core aims to reflect the knowledge base of the faculty en masse. But because of the wide scope of classes such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, the specialization of professors makes teaching survey classes especially challenging. Ovadia Labaton, CC 'O5 and a student member of the Committee on the Core Curriculum, cites ""historical inertia given that the Core has been around since 1918"" as a reason for the Core's Western leaning. A Western education will naturally turn out Western-educated professors, who in turn may only be comfortable teaching Western perspectives. This cycle reaches thepoint where many academes fail to recognize non-Western texts of comparable profundity and instead opt for the traditional Western canon. As one professor said, ""I would be interested to know of corresponding texts, but I don't think there are any."" Another obstacle to proposals for a diverse Core is the problem of time, according to Labaton. ""Since you cannot study seven cultures effectively, you study one and do it well,"" he said.However, the Core's Western focus reflects the comfort zone of the students as much as it reflects that of the professors. Michael Seidel, professor of English and Comparative Literature and former chair of the COC, said the material included in the Core is ""the basis of so much of what people know and think in this world. The authors you read later have read the same authors that you read in the Core."" Many people consider such afamiliarity reason enough to learn the Western tradition first. Students' general familiarity with Western culture facilitates their comprehension and analysis of the ideas. Professor Robert Harrist, who teaches Chinese art, remembers ""the immediate payoff from studying the Parthenon. Our everyday physical environment is shaped by this tradition, and life is more interesting when you know why things are the way that they are."" Labaton emphasized that ""Columbia does not need to apologize for [the Core] being Eurocentric; America was built on European ideas. However, we should recognize that these ideas often developed within an invaluable world dialogue, and those voices also deserve a place in the Core."" To a certain extent, through imperialism, globalization, and warfare, the bedrock of American ideas has worked its way into the bedrock of many non-Western cultures. The 1988 deßary Report notes the challenge in drawing a firm line between the European and the nonEuropean, citing the modern Westernization of the East alongside the influence of Eastern ideas on Western thinkers. Beyond its Eurocentrism, the principle criticisms of the Core challenge its relevance to contemporary issues and to a multicultural age. For some professors, analyzing ancient texts in the context of contemporary issues injects Core classes with a certain amount of vitality. Contemporary issues such ashuman rights and social rebellion ""come up in every text we discuss in the Core,"" Seidel said. ""Boccaccio was a social critic; the Iliad may be an anti-war poem. These texts last a thousand years because they are still relevant."" David Johns, CC 'O4, protests that relating the texts to the contemporary world is not sufficient. ""You cannot tell minority students that they need to take something and translate it to make it reflect their experience,"" he said. ""As a black student, my experience is not represented in the Core."" But tailoring the Core to each student would be impossible, according to David Johnston, professor of Political Science and cochair of Contemporary Civilization on the COC. ""[Classic texts] don't directly reflect anybody's experience very much,"" he said. ""Some students will come to the college with a stronger background in the material, but we cannot correlate that type of education to the race or gender of the students."" Some insist that studying the exiled and rebellious ideas of the past teaches the student how to engage in social critique. ""We give people the tools to talk about the particular by talking about the general,"" Zetzel said. To this end, the Core must be taught in a way that brings out current issues. Johns finds this approach too indirect. ""It is not enough to say, I'm giving you the tools,"" he said. 'The Core needs to actively take part in that struggle."" Harrist, who is also chair of Art Humanities, pointed out that the works studied in the Core present some of the most revolutionary ideas in history. 'These works are subversive, and when you study this stuff you become subversive yourself,"" he said. ""It teaches doubt."" In general, professors seem to acknowledge that social struggle needs to happen, but outside of the classroom. ""We can talk theoretically about how to ride a bike, but ultimately you need to get out there and do it yourself,"" Johnston explained. Zetzel opposes an explicit focus on contemporary issues: ""I don't think we should be teaching anything that any intelligent person can go read about on their own, or see in the newspaper."" So why does this subject keep coming up year after year? One professor suggests that perhaps it is because the Core is working: the students have become rebellious.

122,Art Humanities,"Strike Begins; 400 Picket on Day One Few Classes Canceled by Graduate Student Strike, But Organizers Enthused",20 April 2004,"Few Classes Canceled by Graduate Student Strike, But Organizers EnthusedBy Rebecca Aronauer and Morgan Sellers Spectator Staff WritersThe shrill whistles and drum beats of the Graduate Student Employees United picket line woke residents on 116 th Street yesterday morning, as hundreds of graduate students, undergraduates, and supporters marched outside Columbia University's Broadway gates demanding union recognition for research and teaching assistants. But after the first day of the indefinite strike, the effects on undergraduate classes remained unclear. The picket lines lasted from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. A New York Police Department officer estimated that 400 to 500 marched over the course of the morning. At noon, members of various other unions on campus joined the picket lines, and the strikers then marched in the gates and around campus. Strike organizers said they were pleased with the turnout. ""For the first day of the strike, it was great,"" said David Carpio, GSEU spokesman and former Columbia graduate student. ""I think the rally we had at the end really energized the teaching and research assistants. We're ready for day two."" Inside the gates, however, it was difficult to determine the extent of the strike's effect. Many department chairs are asking TAs to notify them if they will be striking, but many had not yet responded. The number of cancelled sections of core classes appeared low, but no numbers were available from University Writing, the class that administrators and the Core office estimated would be most affected. No Monday/Wednesday Music Humanities sections were canceled because of the strike, and only a few Art Humanities sections were canceled yesterday afternoon. Finals for all core classes will be held. Art Humanities director Robert Harrist does not know precisely howmany Tuesday/Thursday sections will meet, but thinks the number will be high. ""For tomorrow, I think it's looking pretty good,"" he said. Only three of 23 Literature Humanities precepts are confirmed as striking, but four have not responded to Core Director Eileen Gillooly's inquiries. Contemporary Civilization has had higher returns: there are four definite striking precepts of 23 and Gillooly is waiting to hear back from eight others. The administration and directors had little time to make alternate arrangements for the strike; three days after the results of the vote were announced, the graduate students went on strike. But Gillooly does not think more time would have made a difference. ""Strikes are intended to inconvenience. I'm not sure whether there is ever enough time to plan effectively for a strike,"" Gillooly wrote in an email. First-years, who tend to take the most courses taught by precepts, like core and language classes, will likely be most affected by the strike. Dahlia Runco, CC 'O7, had two classes canceled: Italian and University Writing. While she said she appreciates the unanticipated free time, she is worried about how the strike will leave her class unprepared for exams. ""I'm glad that we have time off, but it puts us at a disadvantage for the final,"" Runco said. Many of the strikers expressed similar regrets about canceling classes. Susan Kart, a graduate student in the Art History department will not teach her Art Humanities class for the duration of the strike. ""I started talking to my class last week about contingency plans,"" she said. ""A lot of the students told me that they were concerned about missing class. I told them that we are all disappointed too ... I'd rather be in class teaching Picasso."" But she, along with hundreds of other teaching and research assistants, demonstrated that the issues at stake were important enough to justify their actions. Many of those walking the picket line said that one of their most important reasons for striking was showing support of their fellow graduate students. Zane Mackin, a second-year graduate student in the Italian department, said that he had a good relationship with the Italian department, and was uncertain about a union before considering its poten-tial benefits to other graduate students. ""Of course I feel ambivalent, because I can make ends meet,"" he explained. But he said that many graduate students had to work extra jobs in order to cover their living expenses and that there were no guarantees regarding stipends, health benefits, or other aspects of graduate student life. Mackin also said that he was concerned about what he perceived as an increasing corporate atmosphere at Columbia. ""There isn't a lot of space for free intellectual exercise anymore,"" he said. Many of the protesters carried signs picturing Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Henry Pinkham, and included a quote from a meeting with English graduate students in which he called GSAS a ""moneysink."" ""It's telling that he's using the terms of the corporation rather than the terms of the university,"" Mackin said. ""What he calls a sinkhole, we call a salary."" But some fear that a union would only hurt the relationship betweengraduate students and faculty. ""Another level of bureaucracy is the last thing in the world that Columbia needs,"" Paul Sheehan, a third-year graduate student in the Music department said. Sheehan, who is continuing to teach his Music Humanities class, said that GSEU had not adequately addressed the effects of a union on the ""intangibles"" of graduate student studies. ""I don't know if a union would be good for us or not,"" Sheehan said, ""but I doubt the sincerity of the union."" Other students are convinced that a union would not be appropriate at Columbia. Adam Meshel, a fifth-year graduate student in the Biological Sciences department, was one of the organizers for Graduate Students Against Unionization, a student group that campaigned opposite GSEU during the debates leading up to the unionization vote two years ago. ""How can you take the concern of a student who is in the English department and compare it with someone in biology?"" he asked. 'To think that you can write a contract that can address all those needs is asking too much."" But Meshel agreed that the votes from two years ago should have been counted. ""We're just as upset at the University for locking up those votes as GSEU is,"" he said. ""If it turned out that the vote had gone infavor of a union, I would back up 100 percent."" GSEU last talked to Senior Executive Vice President Robert Kasdin nine months ago about the University dropping the appeal to the National Labor Relationship Board that has prevented the 2002 ballots from being counted. President Lee Bollinger did not reply to State Senator David Paterson's letter confirming that a majority of TAs and RAs had signed union authorization cards and asking the University to withdraw its appeal. Provost Alan Brinkley did try to set up an appointment with the senator, but no meeting materialized. The administration did not realize that after Paterson's letter, GSEU's next step would be a strike. ""I realized that the issue would become a live issue again on campus. There was nothing in the letter to suggest a strike. I just didn't think this was the likely result,"" Brinkleysaid. After the first day of striking, there are no plans for a meeting between the administration and GSEU. Administrators have already rejected GSEU's demands for union recognition, a third party union authorization card count or withdrawing their appeal to the NLRB. ""We're not really in a negotiation situation. The union is asking that we drop our appeal and that's not something the administration is willing to do,"" Brinkley said. ""There's no middle ground between these positions."" Brinkley said that if approached, the administration would be willing to talk to GSEU and is waiting for them to end the strike. ""It's their decision,"" he said. However, GSEU organizers hope that the strike will convince the University to reevaluate its position. The picket line will continue today, and on Wednesday the undergraduate group Students for Environmental and Economic Justice is calling for a school wide boycott of classes and a rally on the Low steps at noon.'Another level of bureaucracy is the last thing in the world that Columbia needs.' —Paul Sheehan Third-year graduate studentWith forces that numbered from around 100 to 200 people at any given time during the day, striking graduate students marched across campus in a demonstration against the University. Various departments including anthropology, mathematics, and English and comparative literature were represented in the brightly colored signs carried by students who quoted everyone from Immanuel Kant to Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Henry Pinkham. The protesters plan to return to the picket lines tomorrow morning and continue indefinitely."
123,Art Humanities,GSEU Picketing Continues Undergraduate Walkout and Rally to Take Place on Low Steps at Noon,21 April 2004,"Undergraduate Walkout and Rally to Take Place on Low Steps at NoonBy Morgan Sellers Spectator Staff WriterThe striking graduate students began to settle in for the long haul yesterday as they protested on College Walk, in sharp contrast to the students and teachers who lounged on the steps of Low Library enjoying the warm Spring weather.Between 60 and 80 teaching and research assistants joined the picket lines yesterday. The turnout corresponded to the participation level that strike organizers expected to see over the long term. ""If everyone showed up all day, every day, we wouldn't last very long,"" said David Carpio, an organizer for the Graduate Student Employees Unite, the organization that is calling for the strike. The effect of the strike onundergraduate classes remains unclear. Carpio said that the total number of striking graduate students will not be known for at least a week. According to Eileen Gilooly, the director of the Core, four Literature Humanities teaching assistants and eight graduate student Contemporary Civilizations teachers are currently on strike. Yesterday, Dean Chris Colombo e-mailed the families of undergraduates, informingthem that the University was taking the necessary steps to ensure ""that students are able to complete the semester."" An undergraduate walk-out and rally organized by the Students for Environmental and Economic Justice will cause the effects of the strike to become increasingly apparent today. The rally will take place at noon on Low Steps. Meanwhile, the debate that began over two years ago about the benefits of unionization at Columbia Continues. Some of the teaching and research assistants that are not striking emphasized the point that GSEU was only representing a portion of the graduate students. ""Not everyone is in favor of the union,"" said Johanna Seasonwein, a third year graduate student in Art History. ""It's very important to me to say that I don't agree."" ""I don't see a role for unions at universities,"" she said. ""I feel very strongly that my role here is as an apprentice teacher and not as a laborer."" ""People don't like to think of their work as graduate students as work that needs to be organized,"" said Michael Palm, a graduate student at NYU who had come to support the strike. Carpio agreed. ""It's a misconception that unions are only necessary for blue collar or low income workers. Unions are good for anyone who has a boss in this country, and wants to have a say. A union is a simple thing,"" he said. ""It's not such a radical idea."" Seasonwein also pointed to the support that Columbia currently gives graduate students. ""I get all my tuition paid for, access to subsidized housing,health coverage, subsidized dental care ... and I get extra grants for summertime research,"" she said. ""I don't see what the problems are. Getting paid to study is a privilege."" Karina Attar, a graduate student in the Italian department, agreed that the benefits of a graduate school education are tremendous, but decided to go on strike regardless. ""I am grateful as a graduate student,"" she said,""but quality of life and intellectual growth are two different things. Nobody here is trying to make $150,000 a year. We're just trying to have a reasonable quality of life. We're the educators of the next generation."" According to Henry Pinkham, dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Sciences, graduate education at Columbia University has been transformed over the past thirty years through the slow development of new methods of funding, and especially since the gradual introduction of a full-fund-ing plan starting in 1996. Currently, in any semester that a graduate student is a teaching fellow, a graduate student receives a stipend—sl7,ooo in 2003-2004 in addition to a full tuition fellowship, for a total value that Pinkham estimated at $50,000 per year. Many students also receive stipends during semesters in which they are not teaching or performing research. Pinkham said that the drive for the increase in funding came primarily from competition with peer institutions. ""If we had not done this, we would no longer have been able to attract top students,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""In terms of funding we are fully competitive with all but perhaps two or three Ph.D. programs in the United States."" Some graduate students say that it's not enough to trust the University. ""You need a voice that does not get its authority from the University itself,"" said Theresa Ventura, a third-year graduate student in the history department. ""There is nothing guaranteeing that the next years of incoming graduate students will have the same package."" Carpio said that many students were overly caught up in predicting the details of possible scenarios that could confront a union and were consequently left frightened by unionization. ""It's paralysis by analysis,"" he said. 'The details come in at the level of the bargaining table."" But for some graduate students, those details are essential in deciding whether or not to supportthe union. Morgan Mihok, a first-year graduate student in the Chemistry department, said that she was reluctant to take a stand because she felt that there were a lot of questions that hadn't been addressed. ""I need more information before I can feel like I am being represented,"" Mihok said. She explained that because so much of the debate took place two years ago, many current students are not informed about the potential benefits or disadvantages of a union. ""The groundwork here may have been done, but it has not been presented to me,"" she said. Mihok said that most of her information had come from talking with GSEU members individually or during rallies and protests. Other graduate students have complained about GSEU's grassroots method of organizing. This approach consisted primarily of contacting graduate students individually throughout the academic year. GSEU members offered graduate students the opportunity to sign union authorization cards that stated that they authorized UAW to ""represent them in collective bargaining"" and to use their names in support of the union. Carpio said that he felt GSEU organizers had done a good job of reaching out to their supporters, and educating other graduate students over the past year. ""When someone says they don't want to be contacted, we don't contact them. Likewise, if they say come back later, we do,"" he said. In addition to concerns about"
124,Art Humanities,Chanting for Unionization: Undergrads Hold Walkout Students Walk Out to Show Solidarity with Their Protesting TAs And Grad Students; SEEJ Moderates as Speakers Rally Crowd.,22 April 2004,"Students Walk Out to Show Solidarity with Their Protesting TAs And Grad Students; SEEJ Moderates as Speakers Rally Crowd.By Julia Israel Spectator Staff Writer""What's disgusting? Union busting! What's appalling? Columbia stalling!"" shouted a group of undergraduates who walked out of classes yesterday in an effort to show solidarity with the graduate students striking for the right to form a union. The event, hosted by Students for Environmental and Economic Justice and organized by Jacob McKean, CC 'O6, started out small. At noon, when the walk-out was set to begin,only eight students had gathered around Alma Mater. ""Can we form a group rather than sitting on the steps?"" McKean, who is also a Spectator deputy city editor, said to his fellow union supporters. ""[Let's] just make it look like we have something going on."" But as the minutes ticked on past noon, SEEJ did indeed have ""something going on."" The striking graduates—6o to 80 of them —joinedthe undergrads on the steps, beating drums, blowing whistles, and drawing a substantial crowd of participants to the steps. Holding signs painted with slogans including ""Don't Fuck with my TA,"" and ""Union Now,"" the undergrads eventually quieted as McKean's voice broke through the chanting. Nate Treadwell, CC 'O5, began the rally by thanking the undergraduates and the graduate students for attending and by relaying his perspective as an undergraduate to Graduate Student Employees United. ""Us undergrads have been hearing a lot from our administration lately ... We've been hearing that Art Hum. teachers are having a very important learning experience every time they grade 20 of the same shit papers about Breugel,"" Treadwell said. McKean then took the microphone to regale the audience with anecdotes from his meeting with Henry Pinkham, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, earlier that day. McKean referred to Pinkham's ""single-ply logic,"" as Treadwell taped a poster that read ""Lee: Stop Embarrassing Me,"" to the knees of Alma Mater. McKean's speech was interrupted as the crowd shouted ""shame"" and booed as Columbia's Chief Legal Counsel walked past. Professor of English Bruce Robbins followed McKean, stressing his belief that he should ""use his seniority to take risks, to be courageous, to become unpopular."" Robbins acknowledged that a level of goodwill exists among his colleagues toward the teaching assistants in his department, but that ""what we need at the level of the university is for students to represent themselves."" Robbins implored those students unsure of whether to support the union to remember that ""unions are the main reason people aren't working six to seven days a week. These are the people who brought you the weekend,"" he said. Following Robbins, Ed Sullivan, former State Assemblyman and a representative of New York City Councilman Bill Perkins, read a letter from Perkins to UniversityPresident Bollinger in support of GSEU. He then added his own words of encouragement to the strikers. ""You know you're going to win,"" Sullivan said. ""You know you're going to win and those who oppose you know they're going to lose."" Stanley Aronowitz, distinguished professor of sociology at CUNY and a former gubernatorial candidate, spoke after Rohbins, recounting Columbia's history of student strikes and equating GSEU's strike with the students' takeover of the Columbia campus in 1968. Aronowitz called Columbia a ""real estate company masquerading as a University,"" and stressed that GSEU must fight not only for the grad students at Columbia but for the students at Yale, at the University of Wisconsin, and all over the nation. ""Ifs time to recognize that the universities of this land rest on the work of graduate students,"" Aronowitz said.Jesse Lemisch, professor of history at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, spoke after Aronowitz, and scorned the law firm that Columbia employs to deal with labor issues, stating that Columbia should cut its ties with the firm. Following the guest speakers, striking sixth-year art history GSAS student Kate Isard and undergraduate Jessica Eisen, BC 'O4, spoke to the crowd before leading the strikers up the steps of Low to continue picketing in front of Earl Hall.

125,Art Humanities,HAVENS The Poor Student's Labyrinth Butler Library Reserves,22 April 2004,"Butler Library ReservesBy Maxwell Foxman Spectator Staff WriterWhen finals come to Columbia, Butler Library is inundated with people who otherwise wouldn't go near it with a tenfoot pole.The Butler Reserves desk is the first stop for students too cheap to buy a book and too lazy to search through the stacks. But behind the door that leads to the Reserves, only a chosen few work-study students may venture. Despite being the largest reserves center at Columbia and the home of the Columbia Media Center, the Butler Reserves at first appear no different from the library's regular stacks. Books of all shapes and sizes line the shelves, neatly organized, with signs indicating each section. Architecture students can find Frank Lloyd Wright design plans, comparative literature students can find the same novel in various translations, and film majors can find the earliest Fellini films. Materials requested by professors from all types of fields sit on the shelf for three semesters, according to Ree DeDonato, director of the Humanities and History Libraries. After a year and a half in the Reserves, books circulate back into the regular pool of books in Butler. As a consequence, the Reserves are never static, but always changing. ""The books cycle through,"" DeDonato said. ""[Professors] tell us periodically what they want for the class, and then we have a formula for figuring out how many we need."" ""These are what's hot,"" said Kristina Rose, supervisor for the Butler Reserves and Milstein Collection, as she thumbed through the Art Humanities offerings. The most popular books, like those from history professor Kenneth Jackson's courses, enjoylong-term stints in the comparably arid and well-lit Reserves. ""Some books never even make it back [to the stacks],"" Rose said. Spiral-bound packets of paper line the first shelf inside the Reserves' back room and seem out of place. 'These are course packs,"" DeDonato said. Whereas professors used to assign course readings in this form, nearly all of these assignments are now available online or through Courseworks. ""At one point this whole room was lined with filing cabinets and now we just have a few,"" she said. 'The reserves have shrunken considerably."" In many ways, the stacks reflect the transition into the computer age. Art prints were kept in the stacks until everything became digitized. 'They were kept in these little green boxes—3oo photos—that we would have to organize every single time,"" DeDonato said. Some of the rarest books are noteven kept in the Reserves, but rather in an offsite storage facility shared by Princeton, Columbia, and the New York Public Library. ""Have you ever been to Home Depot? It's like that with these huge shelves filled to the top with books that you get down with forklifts,"" DeDonato said. In addition to storage space, the stacks also provide a means of preservation. One shelf contains almost every Columbia yearbook since the late 1800s. 'There are a few missing,"" DeDonato said, including what she called ""the infamous 1968 yearbook,"" which she said is extremely rare. In recent years, the stacks have become a storage facility for more than just books. DeDonato pointed to old Christmas decorations and lights in one aisle near the yearbooks. The Reserves desk also houses the Columbia Media Center, which was installed there during a previous renovation. Now housing thou-sands of videos and DVDs, the center has some of the most obscure films as well as some of the most popular, including Bowling for Columbine and Nightmare Before Christmas (on hold for a folk story class). However, this massive collection of movies, which now include full BBC television series and even a section of obscure movies donated by teachers. ""Originally the teachers got together and decided on a 200-movie core,"" DeDonato said, adding that every year teachers' requests are added to the film series permanently. While all this knowledge and art is free with a CUID, overdue books come with a price. The maximum $5O fine plus replacement fees for lost books often make students resentful. ""We try to keep them calm,"" DeDonato said. ""We don't want them to have heart attacks, and we have been known to be lenient about things at times.""A work-study student's eye view from inside the shelves of the Butler Reserves (clockwise from above); The Butler Media Center offers a cheaper, less judgmental alternative to Kim's; Manila folders are a primitive version of Courseworks for professors; One can find Rogers' and Hammerstein's yearbook photos in the collection dating back to the 1800s."
126,Art Humanities,"ArtStor to Provide New Online Collection of Art Currently Available to Columbia Students via Trial Version, New Online Art Database Would Add Over 150,000 Images",22 April 2004,"Currently Available to Columbia Students via Trial Version, New Online Art Database Would Add Over 150,000 ImagesBy Harini Angara Spectator Staff WriterArt Humanities students who need Monet or the Parthenon in a hurry have a new resource that allows them to view artwork from the comfort of their dorm rooms. Members of the Columbia community can access over 300,000 works of art online thanks to an initiative spearheaded by University Libraries and the art history department alongside the not-for-profit organization ArtStor. ArtStor is currently in a trial version; whether or not it will become a permanent resource at Columbia has yet to be determined. ArtStor was first created by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2001 and became an independent organization in 2004. It aims to provide digital access to art, architecture, and archaeology images for educational and scholarly purposes. The database will serve museums, not-for-profit organizations, and individual scholars as well as universities. In an April 12 ArtStor press release, Mellon Foundation President William G. Bowen said, ""The fit between new technology and visual images is an unusually promising one. The ability to com-bine-and make active use of-images, data, texts and other materials offers the opportunity to bring about a substantial and exciting transformation in art-related teaching, learning, and research."" The program is currently in a year-long testing phase; the final version will be released for subscription in July 2004. This test version of ArtStor was made available to Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Smith, and various other universities and colleges because of the eminence of their art history departments. The test version of ArtStor can be accessed with a valid Columbia UNI from the University Libraries' Web site. Depending on factors such as the libraries' budget and the quality of the test ArtStor, the decision to subscribe to the final version of the program will take place sometime before July. Columbia's Visual Media Center currently boasts a collection of over 35,000 digital images. A partnership with the final version of ArtStor would increase that collection by over 150,000 works. It would provide access to famous, popular artwork of general interest as well as allowing those who want to gobeyond Mona Lisa to find the esoteric and obscure, like The Illustrated Bartsch, a collection of more than 57,000 Renaissance prints. For universities with extensive art collections, ArtStor establishes a link through which the institutions can share resources with a simple click of the mouse. Recently, UC-San Diego's large collection of art slides was made available to participating institutions. The availability of print and art material online, especially at Columbia, has rapidly grown in the past few years. ""The libraries are now deeply involved in digital imaging as a long-term resource,"" said Robert Carlucci, director of the Visual Media Center. ""Only in the last few years has it [digital imaging] matured enough to become a library-wide function."" The days of art history students trekking all the way to Avery Library are numbered; soon students will be able to find many of those works on their computer through ArtStor. ""ArtStor allows users faster access to a broad range of images. It serves the students' desire and need to access [these images] from home,"" said assistant professor of art history and archaeology Cordula Grewe, who also said that online databases are invaluable resources in accessing information. Faculty members can use the database to augment their use of slides in lessons. Professors in many humanities departments--not just the Art History department-regu-larly use images of art and architecture to complement their lessons. Because of the facility of image access with ArtStor, those professors will likely find it easier to incorporate art images into their lesson plans now. For example, according to Carlucci, history professors teaching classes about aspects of American culture in the 19th century can enhance their students' depth of understanding by directing them to ArtStor to view paintings of that era. The Visual Media Library, for its part, will no longer have to spend time digitizing images that are already part of ArtStor's archives. The library staff can now focus on the specialized needs of faculty for teaching and research. It will have more time to digitize the rarer collections and works that are not yet available on ArtStor.'ArtStor allows users faster access to a broad range of images.' —Cordula Grewe Assistant Prof, of Art History"
127,Art Humanities,Hundreds Picket on Day 8 Highest Turnout Yet as Sweeny and Hall Speak in Favor of Union Vote,29 April 2004,"Highest Turnout Yet as Sweeny and Hall Speak in Favor of Union VoteBy Rebecca Aronauer Spectator Staff WriterAs the Graduate Student Employees United strike entered its eighth day, hundreds of graduate students and supporters rallied on 116 th Street yesterday. Fueled by pizza and coffee, union advocates braved the unseasonable cold to hear John Sweeny, the president of the AFLrCIO, and Sonny Hall, the president of the Transport Workers Union, speak in favor of a union vote. Turnout at the picket line yesterday afternoon was the highest it has ever been. Since the strike began last Monday, dozens of discussion sections, labs, language classes, and Core classes have been canceled. But the University and GSEU have not formally met to discuss GSEU's demand of union recognition. The strike organizers said that teaching assistants and research assistants would consider returning to work if they could vote on unionization or the administration dropped its appeal to theNational Labor Relations Board and counted the ballots on unionization from two years ago. After eight days of striking, the University's policy is still to wait until the NLRB rules on its 2002 appeal. To minimize disruption during the strike, provost Alan Brinkley has demanded that every student receive marks in all classes and that seniors' grades be reported in time for them to graduate. Core directors are also trying to reduce the strike's effect. In Art Humanities, five out of 23 preceptors are striking, but no sections have been cancelled. Robert Harrist, the director of Art Hum., and last year's Art Hum. director Holger Klein, have each taken over two sections. Harrist hired one summer adjunct professor to teach the last section. Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum, has planned review sessions for Contemporary Civilization, the class the strike has affected most dramatically apart from University Writing.While yesterday's rally did not change the administration's position, it did show that support for a vote on unionization is still strong. Aided by a unionization group at Yale, unionized graduate students from NYU, the Transport Workers Union of Greater New York, Columbia maintenance staff, and Columbia, Barnard, and Teachers College clerical workers, police estimate that the GSEU picket line included between 800 and 1,000 people at one point. At 12:20 p.m., the picketers stopped marching, and Maida Rosenstein, the president of Local UAW 2110, rallied the protesters by asking, ""What do we want? Union! When do we want it? Now!"" Rosenstein then introduced Sweeny, who had spoken in favor of a unionization ballot on the eve of the strike vote on April 13. Yesterday, he reiterated his and AFL-ClO's support of GSEU. ""We're standing with you. We'llfight beside you as long as it takes to bring Columbia to justice,"" Sweeny said. Sweeny has tried to meet with University President Bollinger to discuss the strike, but Bollinger has not returned his calls. Connie McQueen of Teachers College, UAW 9 Assistant Director Julie Kushner, Local 1199 Executive Vice President Betty Hughly, and City Council members Christine Quinn and Gale Brewer also gave speeches supporting GSEU.I he last speaker was history graduate student Nellie Boucher. ""Every day Columbia has tried to ignore us, but they can't ignore us anymore,"" said Boucher, who has been on the picket line every day since the strike began. With that, the crowd of hundreds followed her and about six drummers through the Columbia gates. The pro-testers circled Low Library, home to senior administrators. Then they overtook Low Steps, chanting, ""Union now!"" 'Today's rally was an amazing show of show of support,"" David Carpio, GSEU spokesman and former Columbia graduate student, said. ""It showed that we're stronger than we were on our first day.""'Every day Columbia has tried ... but they can't ignore us.' —Nellie Boucher Striking Graduate StudentYesterday's graduate student protest featured the largest turnout of supporters of the last eight days."
128,Art Humanities,"Graduates Honor 'Great Teachers' CC's Hood, SEAS's Shahabuddin, and Core's Smit Win Teaching Awards",30 September 2004,"CC's Hood, SEAS's Shahabuddin, and Core's Smit Win Teaching AwardsBy Josie Swindler Spectator Staff WriterThe Society of Columbia Graduates awarded its two latest Great Teacher Awards last night to psychology professor Donald Hood and industrial engineering and operations research professor Perwez Shahabuddin. History professor Jacob W. Smit received special recognition for his dedication to the Core Curriculum. Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Zvi Galil and Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley spoke briefly before Society President Paul A. de Bary, CC '6B, announced the winners. Quigley told the crowd of approximately 150, mostly alumni from the 1940s through the 19605, that ""greatteaching is in fact quite a mystical experience"" for both students and teachers. ""Great teaching is an enormous intellectual challenge,"" he said. Hood, the James F. Bender professor of psychology, has taught at Columbia for more than three decades. In 1993 the Columbia College Student Council gave him the Mark van Doren Award for Outstanding Teaching. From 1982 to 1987, he was the vice president for Arts and Sciences. Telling the crowd that students have changed only superficially in his 35 years at Columbia, Hood said, ""There's more metal hanging from different parts of the body ... more holes drilled ... more baseball caps, especially facing the wrong way."" But he emphasized that students are as intellectually aggressive as ever, and that Columbia outshines its peers inthat respect. Shahabuddin has only been at Columbia since 1994, and was not made a full professor until January 2004. He came to Columbia from his native India by way of Stanford. Before teaching at Columbia he conducted research for IBM. Shahabuddin said he longed to enter academia because ""I was missing interacting with young minds ... their enthusiasm ... their idealism."" He won one of the first Distinguished Faculty Teaching Awards from the Columbia Engineering School Alumni Association. Shahabuddin, who has a slight speech impediment, said, ""Despite my stuttering I do manage to connect with my students. ... There is something mystical in that connection."" He praised his students forgiving him a chance to prove himself based on content rather than judging him by his first lecture. Since the Core's inception nearly 60 years ago, Smit has been one the few people to ever teach all four of its major classes: Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities, which he says he did because hecouldn't decide what to be when he grew up. ""My life would become totally empty without having [students] around me constantly,"" Smit said. Following the awards and the brief acceptance speeches, Middle East and Asian languages and cultures professor George Saliba presented a PowerPoint lecture entitled ""Arabic Science and the Making of the Renaissance Europe.""The ceremony, held in Low Rotunda, was the 56th Great Teacher Awards Dinner sponsored by the Society, and the Society's 95th annual meeting. Previous award winners include Mark Van Doren in 1949, Lionel Trilling in 1955, William Theodore de Bary in 1970, James B. Shenton in 1976, Eric Foner in 1991, Kenneth Jackson in 1999, and Alan Brinkley in 2003.Engineering professor Perwez Shahabuddin and psychology professor Donald Hood wait to receive their Great Teacher Awards.Donald Hood was one of two professors honored last night with a Great Teacher Award."

130,Art Humanities,Don't Study Too Hard: Final Time Treats What Time Can Afford Sheena Gordon,9 December 2004,"What Time Can Afford Sheena GordonI love to torture myself with books I don't have time to read. I'll just stand in the bookstore and scan the covers for titles that beg me to read their first lines. (There is nothing like a perfect first sentence rich with drama.) I usually don't go past the first page. I just want a taste of what I can't finish, and if I am really in a damaging mood I might just get the book and put it on the shelf along with all the other books I have yet to read for class. I don't suggest that everyone spend stolen time like this. If you haven't accomplished anything else during your time at Columbia, you should at least have a strict, and unique, procrastination regimen. But as the semester ends, these moments of distraction get harder to justify. There is the excitement for classes to finish and then the rush to digest whole books you will not remember once exams end. This is the time of year when we all discover how long we can go without sleeping and taking a shower. Information that seemed difficult and confusing becomes clear as the time to absorb it all dwindles. But during this semi-an-nual nightmare, we all still need a break. So why not ingest a few more things that will be discharged when finals are over, and try out one of these more efficient modes of procrastination. At least they will be more fun and less torturous than reminding yourself of all the books you can't finish in time. In between readings, grab a newspaper or go online and check out the latest comics. My favorites are the Doonesbury comic strips by G.B. Trudeau, and the social exploits of two youngsters in Aaron McGrunder's The Boondocks. The stories are mainly pictures, so you can finally tap into some of that Art Humanities knowledge. The strips don't have deep plots like comic books, but they are light and sharp. They will ease your mind enough so that you can go back and reread the same page of The Confessions that you have been reading for an hour, and those calculus formulas won't all seem the same anymore. The editorials in newspapers also offer surprisingly good mental breaks. You could read the news reports, but to keep it light I would stick with commentary. It's not the news in depth, but it will let you out of the terrarium that Columbia can feel like and give small doses of information on the world, accompanied by witty insights. However, if you just want the humor without the accuracy, there is The Onion, which calls itself ""the finest news source,"" waiting on street corners to be picked up for free. The articles seem outrageous, but that's because life is outrageous. The best light guilty-pleasure readings are definitely magazines. I am not talking about esteemed magazines like The New Yorker; I am referring to eye candy like Cosmopolitan, People, and even Us. From news about the latest fashion items to gossip columns, there's something for everyone. Some people might look down on these journalistic gems as pure trash, but one day they will be the weighty historical documents that are used to judge our culture. And if you ever begin to feel slightly guilty when reading one, remember that there isn't any reading material that is more contemporary and possibly relevant. It might be more daring to just read a book you have been dying to read, having nothing to do with your classes, but you might hate yourself when grades come in. Don't waste too much time when you should be studying, but also remember to give yourself a break.Sheena Gordon is a Columbia College senior majoring in English."
131,Art Humanities,"Expensive Tuition, Free Artwork Columbia Aims to Increase Student Access to City's Cultural Institutions",10 December 2004,"Columbia Aims to Increase Student Access to City's Cultural InstitutionsBy NoorZaidi Spectator Staff WriterCost of watching cheesy biopic Alexander. $lO. Average club cover charge: $2O. Amount spent on a nice dinner in New York: too much. Standing in front of Van Gogh's Starry Night: priceless—literally. At least, that's the kind of feeling Columbia and the surrounding cultural institutions in New York are hoping to instill in students, as attempts continue to make museums and performing arts more accessible and attractive to college students. Offering an abundance of optionsto choose from—including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center, the Guggenheim Museum, and the New York Philharmonic—University administrators say they want students to explore the diverse cultural life of the city and take advantage of an increasing amount of low-price incentives. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Modern Art are all free for students with CUIDs. Music institutions provide special discounted tickets, called student rush tickets, the morning of the performance. Carnegie Hall, the Metropoli-tan Opera, and the New York Philharmonic all offer such tickets. Walter Frisch, chair of Music Humanities, said that students are actively utilizing reduced pricing policies. ""Rush tickets do require some initiative from students. But I think the number of institutions that are giving good deals, even if it isn't specific to Columbia, is increasing and I think students are taking advantage,"" Frisch said. Director of University Arts Initiative Gregory Mosher agreed. ""Some of these art museums and collectionshave very enlightened prices,"" he said. ""I think ifs probably because those places realize that it's really smart to get young people looking at art, and if they like it now, they'll come back and look. If you're running an arts institution, you're just nuts if you don't get the young people in. Because the Met is publicly funded, it does not require admission at all but has a $l5 suggested entry fee. The Whitney and MoMA museums don't receive money from Columbia, but allow Columbia students free admission. But Mosher acknowledged that many performing arts institutions do not currently make an adequate effort to attract students. ""Some of them have absurd student polices. You go down at like three in the morning to try to get student rush tickets, stand in a long line, sing your school song, completely ruin your day, then you might just get let in,"" he said. Efforts to engage students in the richness of New York cultural lifebegan with the additions of Art and Music Humanities to the Core Curriculum in 1947. The courses aim to acquaint Columbians with a way of critically appreciating the art world. ""I think it's great that some students that had little exposure to visual arts, by the end of the semester are very much involved in the art world,"" said Zainab Bahrani, Art Humanities chai. In addition, according to Deborah Martinsen, acting director of the Core Curriculum, the University recently bought a membership to the New York City Opera so that students could attend at a highly subsidized rate. Students are now given a choice of where they prefer to sit and pay according to a pricing tier, whereas in previous years the only option was in the cheapest section. While the two courses are required for graduation and expect students to devote some time to visiting museums or attending musical performances, the University is attempting to promote the exploration of the arts for students beyond the Core. Mosher acknowledged that for many students, the greatest impedi-ment of taking fuller advantage of the city comes from lack of information. ""You know it's all out there, but how do you access it?"" Mosher said. ""Those are the things that people keep saying. By the time you get all the information, you think, 'Screw it, IH go to the West End and have a beer.'"" Though he was hesitant to reveal any details, Mosher said he is currently in the process of putting together a large cultural package that would increase ticket access for Columbians. ""It's central to me that for all the historians and the French majors and the law students and everybody else, this program exists for them,"" Mosher said. However, there are those city-sawy Columbians like Lucy Plumb-Reyes, CC 'O7, who already rely on their desire to explore New York to enjoy new experiences. ""There are the student deals for incredible things that are really accessible—that is, if people ever leave campus. I'd feel foolish if I didn't. From the get-go, I chose Columbia not for Butler and the Core, but rather for places like Lincoln Center.""A CUID gains entry to the newly opened MOMA and other museums for free as part of Columbia's emphasis on student involvement In the arts."
132,Art Humanities,Contributor The Union of Ungrateful Graduates,22 April 2005,"The Union of Ungrateful GraduatesBy Julia KiteFree tuition, a stipend of anywhere from $lB,OOO to $25,000 per year, and halfpriced health care—if I, as an undergraduate, received such an excellent deal, you can bet I would be kissing Lee Bollinger's feet After all, with student debt rising, who wouldn't be grateful? But if you're a Columbia graduate student who is on strike this week, not only do you view this package as a paltry sum but also as a complete outrage. It seems that despite the high level of intelligence most people assume Columbia students to have, some graduates working toward higher degrees are lacking an essential grip on reality. Last week, I asked my art humanities teacher, a foreign,student working toward her Ph.D., if she would be participating in the strike. No, she replied, and gave a list of all Columbia had done for her, including paying more than $20,000 in medical bills when she gave birth to her first child. ""I don't think this school owes me anything,"" she continued, citing how teaching art hum gave her essential work experience and, of course, how not having to worry about tuition freed her mind so that she could concentrate on her work. I wanted to stand up and give this woman a round of applause, because she stated clearly what seems to evade the strikers: Getting your graduate degree from Columbia is an honor. When you're paid to do so, if s a privilege. And if you start looking this gift horse in the mouth, then you deserve to get bitten. Strike supporters trot out the usual rhetoric—an unfair administration is insensitive to their needs. Well, if they are so insensitive, then why do they shell out millions of dollars to subsidize the doctorates of their graduate students? What really outraged me, however, was being told by this rational graduate student that the only people who could vote for or against the strike were those who had already signed union cards. It doesn't take a Ph.D. student to under-stand that under this setup, the only people allowed to vote were those who supported the strike. How dare the strikers feel outrage toward the administration for not listening to them when last year, they protested right outside the groundfloor windows of disabled student housing? The National Labor Relations Board has a firmer grip on reality than any of the striking students, and Columbia graduates ought to recognize that when the value of your stipend is more than what the average Harlem resident earns in one year, you need to get a grip and realize that your subsidized education is a privilege, not a form of oppression. Yes, the cost of living in New York City is astronomical, but Columbia is not your baby sitter. If you want to earn a graduate degree, you need to act like an adult and take responsibility for yourself Columbia is already paving your way to a Ph.D. Work a few years before returning to graduate school. Don't eat at the Hungarian Pastry Shop everyday. And please, please take a moment to think about New York workers who really need to unionize—supermarket cashiers and fast food workers making barely above minimum wage, people in real danger of not having enough to live on, let alone to pursue a doctorate. I don't see why, as undergraduates with mounting debts, we should feel compelled to support striking grad students who don't recognize the privilege they have. Perhaps they are stuck in the idea that this is still 1968. Or maybe they'll never be happy until Columbia administration holds their hands from undergraduate life until they get jobs. Of course, we can always have a compromise. Fine, give the graduate students a union—but then start charging them more than $26,000 in tuition. I'm sure that would please them just fine.The author is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in Urban Studies and Writing."
133,Art Humanities,"GSEU Strikers Return To the Classroom Opinion Split on Effects of One-Week Strike, Administration Still Not Willing to Negotiate",25 April 2005,"Opinion Split on Effects of One-Week Strike, Administration Still Not Willing to NegotiateBy John Davisson Spectator Staff WriterAcross the University, graduate preceptors, instructors, teaching assistants, and research assistants will return to their classes today, one week after Graduate Student Employees United began its second strike in as many years. While many will return fresh from the picket lines, armed with firsthand accounts of the labor trenches, others will continue teaching uninterrupted, unfazed, and unmoved by the efforts of their peers. The question of how many of each, exactly, is an open one. ""My sense is that it had broad support,"" said Maurice Leutenegger, a GSEU organizer and RA in the physics department. ""It would be hard to imagine that it wouldn't have some impact."" Though the effectiveness of the strike remains uncertain, GSEU's presence was quite visible during the week. Members conducted daily picket lines outside the 116 th Street gates, participated in rallies near campus and downtown, and testified at a hearing of the New York City Council Committees on Laborand Higher Education. The strike was also coordinated with that of Graduate Employees and Students Organization, Yale's counterpart to GSEU. ""Whether they like to admit it or not, we had a major impact on the University during the week of the strike,"" said David Wolach, a GSEU organizer. ""The University administration has been thoroughly embarrassed."" Lytton Smith, a second year student in the Graduate School of the Arts and University Writing instructor, expressed doubt about GSEU's methods, including the recent strike. ""I can understand why they're doing what they're doing, but I just now feel like we're caught in a deadlock position where the University's not going to budge,"" Smith said. Provost Alan Brinkley downplayed the effect of the strike on the University's operation. ""It's not trivial, but it wasn't enormous either,"" Brinkley said. ""Like last year, it was concentrated mostly in the Core, and it did have a significant impact, especially onUniversity Writing, also on CC and Lit Hum. We don't have specific numbers, but a very large proportion of those sections did not meet."" Last Thursday, through interviews and independent e-mail polling, Spectator attempted to gauge the strike participation of the 168 precepts and instructors who currently lead sections of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and University Writing, the five courses believed most widely affected by the strike. Of the 93 respondents, 65 percent reported having cancelled all of their classes, 2 percent reported having cancelled only some of their classes, and 33 percent reported that they held all of their sections. Of those who held class, 20 percent reported having conducted at least one class off-campus. Eighty percent of those cancelling classes said that they had or intended to participate in GSEUorganized strike events. Polling did not include precepts, TAs, or RAs serving in other departments and does not necessarily reflect participation across the broader graduate population. The data suggests that a large majority of TAs from the five sampled Core classes chose to respect the strike action, but the numbers fall short of the 80-plus percent support that GSEU reported from its strike vote. Professor Joseph Bizup, director of the Undergraduate Writing Program, said that though a ""great many"" sections of University Writing did not meet, professors were not asked to stand-in forstriking instructors. ""Pedagogically, it doesn't make sense to cover a class with someone for one week when the students have been working on their writing with another instructor all semester,"" Bizup said. Professor Deborah Martinsen, acting director of the Core Curriculum, estimated that ""slightly over half' of Lit Hum precepts and three-quarters of CC precepts were not in their classrooms during the week. ""Some of them are out on strike, some of them are just not in their classroom,"" Martinsen said, referring to a small segment of graduate teachers who moved classes to off-campus locations. Like University Writing, the classes were not otherwise covered. GSEU organizers were hopeful about the long-term outcome of the unionization movement. ""The only criteria that we have to know if we succeed at some point is if they agree to negotiate with us, but that doesn't mean we failed if they didn't immediately agree to do so,"" Leutenegger said. Brinkley expressed openness to a dialogue on the concerns of graduates. ""[President Bollinger] said last year that he believed that we should have a discussion within the community about this and that it shouldn't just be his decision as to what we do,"" he explained. ""It's something that we would be open to discussing in the community, but it would be a discussion that would certainly have to include the faculty."" To date, the University has maintained that graduate teachers are fundamentally students and not employees.GSEU STRIKE POLL Are you cancelling your classes this week as part of the strike?

134,Art Humanities,Letters to the Editor,26 April 2005,"Letter Writer's Blog Betrays Biased Hidden Agenda To THE EDITOR: In his venomous April 19th letter lo the editor, Ariel Beery grossly misrepresented my April 14th op-ed in Spectator, as well as' his own past statements. I did not attempt a perfect equation of his views with those of Charles Jacobs or other Zionists. Indeed, I made no mention of Zionism, but discussed the unsupported accusations of bias that the likes of Beery, Jacobs and many others (including Bollinger, Kramer. Pipes, and Kasturi) have made against MEALAC professors. But Mr. Beery did not address my actual argument. Despite the disingenuous statement that his campaign ""has nothing to do with the politics of the professor,"" he has repeatedly accused MEALAC and the entire field of Middle East studies of bias, without ever defining the term. Take his Nov. 7, 2004 blog post entitled ""Bias, Then and Now,"" about Dr. Massad, or his January 2003 op-ed in the Spectator, where he refers to ""a clear and unabashed bias"" in MEALAC, or his March 2003 article referring to the department's ""one-sidedness."" And these are but three examples. Even his attempt to play good-Arab-bad-Arab by ""defending"" Khalidi flatly contradicts his own statements. In a May 2003article he calls Khalidi a racist and accuses him of being a poor scholar and professor. Thus, Mr. Beery's claim that he is only concerned with intimidation is a shameless distortion of the truth. Yet it is politically useful for him to speak the language of intimidation and paint himself as a critic of Israeli policy, though 1 will pay good money to anyone who can find more than superficial criticism of Israel in any of Beery's writings. This tack provides a cloak for his real agenda, which is not to encourage debate but to silence criticism of Israeli policy. I would counsel Mr. Beery that if he wishes to play the victim, he ought read his own'blog first. ISSA MIKEL, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL April 20, 2005 Submission Unfair to Hardworking Grad Students To THE EDITOR: Reading Julia Kite's editorial (""The Union of Ungrateful Graduates,"" April 22) gives one the impression that teaching fellows and research assistants are students getting a freelunch. My art humanities teacher organizes two lectures a week, in addition to grading hundreds of quizzes and dozens of papers and tests over the course of the semester. He does this in exchange for a stipend, discounted tuition, and health care (which disappears if he gets too sick to teach). On my planet, these are what we call ""pay"" and ""benefits."" The Bush-appointed management-side lawyers, with their ""firm grip on reality,"" may think otherwise, but wheii I go to class, the person standing in front isn't there as a student. . Are TAs and RAs here privileged, in the sense that they have it easier than supermarket cashiers? Sure. But the right to organize and bargain collectively isn't contingent upon how bad your lot in life is. Workers have the right to organize. The House, Senate, and President said so in the 30s, the UN said so in the 40s, and neither of those declarations was contingent upon workers being ""grateful."" Our administrators and, yes, our undergrads, should exercise a bit of humility and gratitude for the folks who teach half of the core. NATE TREADWELL, CC 'O5 April 22, 2005"
135,Art Humanities,SOUTHERN COMFORT Just Another Average Day In the Life of a Football Player,5 October 2005,"Just Another Average Day In the Life of a Football PlayerRecently, across Columbia's campus, wedged between the experience of tripping on the steps of Low and stumbling out of the basement of the West End, a new rite of passage seems to have emerged: bashing athletes. This phenomenon became even clearer to me during a recent Contemporary Civilization class, when a female classmate leaned over and whispered, ""What a dumb-ass athlete ... He doesn't belong here.""The athlete to whom she was referring—an obvious lineman whose bulky frame was overflowing his small chair —had just finished making a brief comment, and all the classroom eyes were staring in his direction, many filled with smirks and grins. At our Ivy League school, football players specifically are often labeled as less ""intelligent,"" ""non-stu-dious"" and ""curve-boosters,"" sentiments that were reflected in the judgmental stares of my CC classmates. So in defense of the athletes, those fit souls that comprise over 15 percent of our university, 1 decided to take matters into my own hands. I decided to pry into the life of sophomore Drew Behrens, a biology major who happens to play on the football team. If I could somehow get a glimpse of his life —that of the average student-athlete —I might be able to evaluate the fairness of such criticisms. From morning until nightfall, I dutifully tagged along. Here's what I found: Tuesday, October 4. 7:15: Like most football players, Behrens' day begins early. Rising out of bed, he turns off his alarm and makes sure his roommate, fellow sophomore Mike Partain, the starting center on offense, is stirring. After a quick shower, he and Partain hustle down to the Dodge Fitness Center, where mandatory meetings await. 7:44: Tucked in a small room underground, a few dozen defensive players crowd around linebackers coach Michael Siravo and listen as he goes over mistakes from the Princeton game, while also presenting the fresh game plan for the game against Lafayette. Behrens, like the rest of the players, is released just before nine o'clock, just in time for his first class. 9:10: Running a little late, Behrens jogs over to Art Humanities to begin the academic part of the day. Having been awake around two hours, Behrens looks with amusement as other students enter the class with slumped shoulders, obviously only a few minutes removed from their beds. 10:35: After Art Hum finishes, Behrens heads over to his Biology lecture, which he takes along with several other football players, including Partain and junior Adam Brekke. With each standing well over six feet tall and carrying plenty of bulk, the threesome appears as an intimidating group. But Behrens says that taking classes with other football players helps him keep up and stay awake. ""Playing football, it's really hard to stay awake in class,"" Behrens said. ""Brekke always tells me to slap him if he falls asleep, and today, he was asleep, and I backhanded him. Everyone was looking, but it's the only way I can make sure he gets the whole lecture."" 11:50: Behrens uses his first break of the day to grab a quick lunch and go back to his room in Scha-piro. His break doesn't last long, because soon after he finishes lunch, he has to get changed into athletic shorts and a t-shirt to prepare for lifting weights. 12:56: Behrens leaves his room, heading back to Dodge to lift. In the hour-long session, which he called a ""tough lift,"" Behrens had to do squat, power clean and bench press. 2:25: After going back to Schapiro for a brief time to get some things, Behrens heads to practice via one of the three buses at Amsterdam Avenue. 3:30: With everyone on the field, after a brief period of team stretching, practice begins. Today's practice, which is the first day of preparing for Saturday's game, is one of the most physically demanding of the week. The team follows a strict grid of 24 preset periods, each lasting five minutes, that are called out overhead on loudspeakers. Behrens spends the bulk of the day with the linebacking group, which is working on containing the outside run, an area of weakness that Princeton exploited. 6:15: Finishing the grueling practice, Behrens heads to the locker room to take a shower and get dressed. 6:42: Luckily, Behrens catches the first bus out of Baker Field, which allows him to return to campus a little faster than most of the team. With many of the players wanting to get home as soon as possible, competition for the early seats is intense. 7:00: Getting off of the bus and entering campus for the first time since the early afternoon, Behrens heads straight to John Jay for dinner. Joined by many of his teammates at the table in their football t-shirts and sweatpants, Behrens and his group stand out. Behrens said that dinnertime with the other players provides a nice time to relax. 7:40: After a full meal at the cafeteria, Behrens returns to his room to put up his backpack and other items. With night falling and the first real expanse of time opening up before him, Behrens heads over to a friend's room in a fraternity house for some down time.9:30: After spending a little less than two hours with friends, Behrens returns to his dorm and spends the next two hours doing homework and watching some television. Planning on going to medical school—like only four others on the team —means that Behrens has many work-filled nights. But with no exams or problem sets slated for Wednesday, and with only a CC reading and small assignment to complete, Behrens' workload on this night is considerably lighter, and he savors it as much as he can. 11:25: Finally, feeling the effects of a weight lifting session, a physical practice, and a seven o'clock wakeup, Behrens climbs into bed. Just before falling asleep, however, Behrens remembers to set his alarm, knowing that the next day will bring the same type of toil and effort. Reflecting on Behrens' day, I was surprised how easily he confronted the large amounts of work with his small amount of free time. Describing his work ethic, he said that he had learned to manage his time, studying mostly on Sundays and Mondays. ""I know that with all the time I spend at football, I can't work harder than people,"" Behrens said. ""But I can work smarter."" His typical day gives evidence to the fact that football players give more of themselves to Columbia than most undergrads could ever dream. Amidst criticism and a general lack of respect, football players such as Behrens work hard to bring life and enthusiasm to the type of events we strictly-students crave: the homecomings, the Baker Blasts, and the former tailgates of lore. Still, while Behrens and others toil ahead, bashing athletes remains cool, whispering ""How the hell did he get in here?"" after class amongst friends provides plenty of laughs. But when Drew Behrens gives his all for Columbia, racking up Dean's List honors along the way, he deals with criticism the only way he knows how: by brushing it off just like so many blockers.Scott Hughes is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in Economics.

136,Art Humanities,Smart Lovebirds: Sharing a Home and University THE PROFILE,21 February 2006,"THE PROFILEBy Cristina Garces, Photo by Matthew DanielEveryone knows the old adage ""don't mix business with pleasure."" Work policies banning relationships between employees and stories of work-place flings gone awry caution against office romance. Columbia, however, takes a different view. Married Columbia professors Andrew and Dawn Ho Delbanco are just one example of the success achieved by disregarding social taboo. ""Don't forget, I have to be at Barnard by five,"" Dawn chirped, as Andrew walked out to teach a class. Their on-campus communication usually consists of fleetingly relaying plans. ""You can see right there that this is one convenience of being in the same environment and the same work place,"" Dawn said. ""It makes things a lot less complicated. It involves a lot less explaining than people who are in different working environments."" For a married couple that works together in an academic setting, dinner dates and class schedules become inextricably tied. But the Delbancos have had a lot of experience working within the restrictions of the academic world. Their love first blossomed in Cambridge, Mass., home to their alma maters Harvard University and Radcliffe College. Junior year of college, they were introduced by their roommates. Mutual like was discovered amidst many shared dinners at the dining hall, where disappointing meal options were given new light. The couple married in 1973, a mere three days after graduation. ""In some sense, it's growing up together that has made our relationship close,"" Dawn said. The Delbancos' relocation to New York was decided by Andrew's job offer from Columbia in 1985. While Dawn stayed home with their then 5-year-old and 10-month-old children, teaching only a few classes on the side, Andrew began teaching almost exclusively for the English department. Six years later, Dawn joined her husband on campus in the art history department. Since their start at the University, Dawn has taught part-time, teaching such classes as Asian Art Humanities, and Art Humanities. Andrew is quick to point out that she also mentors several graduate students. ""It's great to have my PR man with me,"" Dawn said. Andrew has also risen in the ranks to become the acclaimed director of the American studies program, a position he was appointed to this past summer. The couple say they owe the campus's location to their continuing marital bliss, and they remark that it is a comfort both during and after the school day. Columbia, boasting a close-knit community, and New York, offering its expansive nature, blend to create a homey yet limitless atmosphere in which the couple's relationship is able to thrive. ""The fact that [we live in] New York City makesall the difference. If it were a small town, dominated by the campus, it would start to feel claustrophobic ... but it's the best of both worlds. We have the big city, but a small neighborhood within the big city,"" Dawn said. Andrew echoed her sentiment. ""Our landlord is the same entity as our employer, which is unusual for most people ... but because we are in New York City, it does not feel limiting."" Some might find it strange to be surrounded by Columbia academia 24/7. The hustle and bustle of the school day does not normally bring to mind images of happy marriages amidst essays to grade. But the couple remains resolute that working together simply means that each has a better understanding of the other's situation. They say it does not mean constant contact with each other. For example, although the couple lives a five minute walk from campus, they do not ""commute"" to work together every day. ""There is a whole part of [your spouse's] existence that you may not be too familiar with. It's not that people have to do exactly the same things,""Dawn said, ""but sometimes it's good when you can... at least have an understanding of the most important aspects of each other's life."" While the Delbanco's enjoy being in a close proximity to one another at all times, the couple's two children decided they would rather not turn the Columbia duo into a quartet. Their children both decided to attend college in other locations. ""Most faculty children feel okay staying here because they never run into their family,"" Andrew said, 'but our children decided to go away to college to stay out of their parents' orbit."" The Delbancos' say their secret to staying happy together lies in their opposite, yet complimentary, personalities. They agree on all the necessary things (""We disagree on shellfish,"" Andrew interjects), but most importantly, they share the same sense of humor, shown through their love for the same television shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm. Not getting along would be a major problem for a couple with such close-knit career and family ties. ""Also, at least one of us is an easy personality,"" Andrew quipped. ""I'll let you guess which one that is.""American Studies Chair Andrew Delbanco and His Wife, Art History Professor Dawn Ho Delbanco, Married Academia When They Married Each OtherAN ACADEMIC MARRIAGE | Professors Andrew and Dawn Ho Delbanco chat in their Morningside Heights apartment.

137,Art Humanities,ART Picasso: One With America,1 November 2006,"Picasso: One With AmericaBY ELIZABETH SIMINS Columbia Daily SpectatorPablo Picasso is probably one of the most recognizable names in art. Whether you're a college senior majoring in art history, or a first semester first-year who has yet to take Art Humanities, chances are you would be able to pick out one of Picasso's famous distorted faces. Surely the work of an artist such as Picasso has had been shown thousands of times, but the Whitney Museum of American Art has managed to exhibit Picasso's work with an entirely new spin. ""Picasso and American Art"" is an ongoing exhibit that showcases Picasso's work alongside the art of the American artists influenced by him over the course of his lifetime. The exhibit illustrates how the Picassopaintings that traveled stateside were enough to grasp the imagination of American artists. The show is structured uniquely, with works influenced by Picasso set next to the piece that served as inspiration. This setup creates an atmosphere that is as accessible as it is interesting. The useful wall-texts also help anchor the curatorial choices in the side-by-side comparisons. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Picasso's famous painting of five prostitutes in a Barcelona brothel, is shown in print next to two paintings, one by surrealist photographer Man Ray and one by cubist Max Weber. Also displayed and inspired by Les Demoiselles is a painting by abstract expressionist Willem De Kooning. Each of these paintings maintains the style of the individual painter but features women in the same signature provocative positions as those in Picasso's masterpiece. A continuous thesis carried throughout the exhibit was that Les Demoiselles was the primary influence for American artists. Theartists who were influenced by Picasso developed their own greatly varied styles, while assimilating aspects of Picasso's techniques. Some painters, like abstract expressionist Arshile Gorky, chose to blend classically painted portraiture with a cubist background, as Picasso occasionally did. Others simply created their own versions of a painting that may have particularly struck them, such as pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, who reinterpreted a Picasso in his signature comic-book style. Jasper Johns, another great American pop artist, clearly saw inspiration in Picasso's painting The Shadow. In several of his paintings, postmodernist Johns painted shadowy figures remarkably similar to the one in The Shadow,and all are displayed at the Whitney alongside the Picasso original. The only drawback to ""Picasso and American Art"" is that, as is bound to happen in an exhibition that focuses mainly on comparisons, there are some parallels drawn that seem to be a little farfetched. Though one might be inclined to raise an eyebrow once or twice, the overall statement of the exhibit seems well thought out. Picasso enthusiasts aren't the only ones who should check out this far-ranging exhibit. Spanning almost a century in scope, the collection shows the truly impressive influence of a man who, as abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock said, ""missed nothing.""GO SEE IT ""Picasso and American Art"" Whitney Museum of American Art Through Jan. 28, 2007 945 Madison Ave. at 75th St.IN LINE WITH A MASTER | The Whitney Museum's latest Picasso exhibit displays a century of art inspired by Picasso alongside his original works."
138,Art Humanities,ART Robert Moses Parts the Sea of N.Y. Critics,6 February 2007,"Robert Moses Parts the Sea of N.Y. CriticsBY RACHEL HENSEL Columbia Daily SpectatorIf you look at the construction photograph carefully, you can just about make him out. He is standing defiantly on the top floor of an unfinished building, leaning over the edge with his hands in his pockets. Like Howard Roark of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, he surveys the landscape with surgical detachment, a city anchored to the feet of the man on the ledge. This is the image of Robert Moses most of us have, thanks to Robert A, Caro's Pulitzer Prizewinning biography from 1974, The Power Broker, which follows Moses' more than three-decade reign as city parks commissioner and chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. From 1934 to 1968, Moses oversaw a radical transformation of New York City through the construction of highways, bridges, and parks, as well as an extensive slum clearance project. For years, The Power Broker remained the most convincing portrayal of a power-hungry bureaucrat who displaced families and uprooted entire neighborhoods to pursue his reckless vision: a city clogged with superblocks and strangled by ribbons of expressway. Until now, that is. The release of Robert Moses and the Modern City, the first major publication devoted to Moses since The Power Broker, is less an indictment of Moses than a nuanced reconsideration of the commissioner's impact, acknowledging both the depth of his destruction and the magnitude of his achievements. The publication of the book, edited by Columbia Director of Art Humanities Hilary Ballon and New York historian and Columbia professor Kenneth Jackson, coincides with ""Robert Moses and the Modern City,"" three concurrent shows on Robert Moses' impact on New York. Curated by Ballon, the three exhibitionsinclude ""Remaking the Metropolis"" at the Museum of the City of New York, ""The Road to Recreation"" at the Queens Museum of Art, and ""Slum Clearance and the Superblock Solution,"" at Columbia's Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery. Ballon has used her home turf to present the full scope of Moses' 1950s urban renewal program, which soon became a model for the rest of the country. ""Slum Clearance and the Superblock Solution"" documents Moses' legacy through never-before-displayed models, plans, brochures, and large-scale color photographs of Moses' projects as they stand today. Organized by city district, the exhibition is punctuated with brochures from the Slum Clearance Committee illustrating how each district would be redeveloped while making a case for the relocation of its residents. Juxtaposed with these tidy official documents are provocative photographs documenting community protests against the messy process of site clearance. Herein lies the strength of the exhibit: ""Slum Clearance and the Superblock Solution"" shows Moses' mastery of the Title 1 slum clearance programs alongside the results—both good and bad. An event chronicling one of the most polarizing figures in the history of American urban planning always runs the risk of bias—especially at a time when Columbia is slated for a controversial expansion. But the Wallach exhibition devotes relatively little attention to Moses' battering-ram persona. In a New YorkTimes article, Ballon admitted that she ""became more and more interested in the tangible things he accomplished"" rather than any perceived flaws in his personality, By separating the man from his works, Ballon has effectively avoided the question of his image, enabling a more impartial consideration of his works. With Moses mostly out of the picture, the show suggests that to use him as the scapegoat for all of New York's urban planning disasters represents not only a gross oversimplification of events but a withdrawal of public responsibility. Tempting as it may be to draw an analogy between Moses' expansion over half a century ago and Columbia's Manhattanville expansion today, the nuanced exhibit points out some distinctions. Yes, Moses did set a precedent for enhancing the city's brainpower by providing universities with land for campus expansion. Without Title 1. said Ballon, universities ""would not have been able to acquire all of that land."" And yes, Moses' famous Title 1 program stipulated for the use of eminent domain, a Fifth Amendment right Columbia may soon exercise. However, through the creation of middle-class housing developments like Stuyvesant Town, Moses was attempting to give back to the middle class. Today, these same developments are being sold to private developers who will drive out working-class families. If the packed crowds at the exhibition opening are any evidence, the changes Moses has brought forth and the arguments he has provoked are still resonating 15 years after his death. The man so fully committed to change that he was willing to risk bulldozing the past has finally become a part of it. With the University on the brink of an expansion, we as Columbians are left with the task of interpreting Moses' impact, recognizing the good alongside the bad and building upon his legacy in an intelligent way.GO SEE IT * • ""Robert Moses • and the Modern City"" Wallach Art Gallery Wed.-Sat., 1-5 p.m. Jan. 31-April 14 JURBAN EXHIBITION | Three new exhibits pay tribute to the legacy of Robert Moses—""Remaking the Metropolis"" at the Museum of the City of New York, ""The Road to Recreation"" at the Queens Museum of Art, and ""Robert Moses and the Modern City"" at Columbia's Miriam and Ira D.

139,Art Humanities,"Rosand-Colored Glasses How the award-winning professor sees the Renaissance, the Core",12 April 2007,"How the award-winning professor sees the Renaissance, the CoreBY MERRELL HAMBLETONThere are no uncluttered surfaces in David Rosand's ninth-floor office. Spillover from shelves arranged with art history books and jackets, curling with age and use, have taken over the ample room, filling up the desk space where youd expect to find a computer. My first meeting with Professor Rosand, which took place in this room last spring over the topic of a paper on Albrecht Durer, was conducted across dust-gather-ing stacks of paper and journals. A notebook balanced precariously in my lap, I remember Rosand, hands and legs folded neatly, looking at me matter-of-factly over the rim of his reading glasses. ""How's your German?"" he asked, as though inquiring about the weather. In March, the Renaissance Society of America awarded Rosand the Paul Oskar Kristeller Lifetime Achievement Award for dedication to the study of the Renaissance. In a sense, the award confirms my wide-eyed, underclassman conception of Rosand: the well-read, quick-spoken, unflinchingly bright, Old World-art historian. Yet this image of Rosand lacks nuance. While the Kristeller award solidifies his position in the succession of notable Renaissance scholars, Rosand's intellectual interests are hardly restricted to pre-1700 Italy. ""When I graduated Columbia College, I wanted to be an abstract expressionist,"" Rosand says with evident amusement. Realizing his painting wasn't up to scratch with his scholarship, Rosand headed back to Columbia for a Ph.D. in art history. Still, Rosand found himself drawn to modernism —not surprising, given the era. The late 'sos were the heyday of Professor Meyer Schapiro, considered by many to be Columbia's preeminent scholar of modern art and whom Rosand, in a recent article, described as a man who ""came to personify art history at Columbia and to stand for a particularly American approach to the study of art."" Rosand recalls Schapiro lectures vyhere ""artists filled the front row —Barnett Newman, Saul Steinberg,"" to name a few. Rosand speaks eagerly about Leo Castelli's gallery on 77th Street, where in 1958 he saw seminal shows by two young artists, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. A shift from abstract expressionism to pop art and conceptualism was dramatically changing the art world, and Rosand was witness. With some fellow graduate students, Rosand (who as an undergraduate at the college wrote for the Jester) began to write criticism in a self-published journal, The Second Coming Magazine. There is clear nostalgia in Rosand's voice when he speaks of engagement with contemporary art, yet he describes his move to the Renaissance as though it had beena forgone conclusion. This move began in collaboration with Rudolf Wittkower, who at that time was doing important work on Venetian architecture and with whom Rosand would ultimately do his doctoral work. As a young scholar, Wittkover had published a twovolume corpus of drawings by Bernini, work that had previously been dismissed as unworthy of serious study. Wittkower s faith in the significance of the line and the artist had a strong impact on the young Rosand, who began to understand a coherent trajectory that could be traced from artists and theorists like Titian and Alberti to Picasso. Rosand speaks of the Renaissance in sweeping terms, as ""a time when the world was being extended by artists."" Even more critical than this, Rosand says, is, ""the emergence of the understanding of the creative ... and critical power of the line."" The Renaissance was simply the most logical place to start. In many ways, Rosand's commitment to the Renaissance is just that—a starting point. As we talk, it's as if Rosand has taken the theoretical principles expounded by the Renaissance and applied them wholeheartedly to his study of art as a whole. An incongruous piece of Chinese brushwork that hangs over Rosand's desk is proof of his fascination with the ""creative and critical"" line. Robert Harrist, professor of Chinese art and current chair of the art history department, describes the introduction to Rosand's book Drawing Acts, which deals with drawing in the West, as""one of the best things I've ever read about Chinese painting ... he [Rosand] writes about the power of lines to both define representational forms and to embody the physical act of making a mark on the surface"" —elements that Harrist and Rosand understand as essential tothe understanding of painting and drawing. Rosand's inheritance of Wittkower's broader definition of canonical art extends well beyond the 16th and 17th centuries. He speaks with great admiration of Wittkower's efforts to bring African and Oceanic art into the fold, not just as examples of a marginalized ""Other,"" but as legitimate, aesthetic forms, and calls his mentor ""responsible for the new direction of the art history department."" The specter of the Dead White Male has consistently proven a point of conflict between the critics and architects of the Core. One might expect that Rosand, in his enthusiasm for the inherent ties between Western and non-Western art, might fall amongst the critics. Yet when I inquire about Art Humanities, a class that reaffirms the Western canon (and includes the works of only one woman), Rosand offers a stern defense. ""Its not a survey,"" he says. ""It's meant to teach students how to talk about art."" According to Rosand's philosophy, this skill should provide a more-than-adequate foundation for learning about all art. As Harrist puts it, ""Professor Rosand is able to see how the energy and animation that a Chinese connoisseur appreciates in a brush-drawn line are like those in drawings by Raphael or Rembrandt."" Rosand, who was a student of art history at Columbia before there was such a thing as the ""feminist"" or ""multiculturalist"" discourse, presumably hopes that Art Hum will provide the analytical background necessary for understanding the expanded art historical canon. Asked to discuss the state of Renaissance studies in the context of a broadening art historical discipline, Professor Rosand is less quick to defend the subject than anticipated. While he encourages expansion of new departments, he says that there is a degree to which the Italian Renaissance is ""fading out."" And yet, ""it is a period that needs to be rearticulated, defended,"" he says. ""There are aesthetic reasons for the emergence of Michelangelo and Rembrandt... Picasso is constantly going back to Rembrandt."" What might be viewed as Rosand's Western orientation is. tempered by his active effort to identify common motives in art. The Renaissance may be his point of origin, but Rosand has every desire to see a world extended by art historians. ■"
140,Art Humanities,Presidential Task Force Places Undergrads in a Global Context,4 October 2007,"BY LAURA SCHREIBER SPECTATOR STAFF WRITERAmong the many ways in which UniveEsity President Lee Bollinger is working to transform Columbia into a ""global university,"" one of the least tangible is how Columbia is working to amend the undergraduate curriculum to require students to engage in global thought in their everyday academic lives. One year ago, Bollinger announced the creation of the President's Task Force for Undergraduate Education, a group formed in part to tackle the major changes necessary to develop such a curriculum. ""The task force will review a number of broad aspects of our undergraduate education, including how well our curriculum serves the rapidlychanging needs of an increasingly globalized world—a world that will require precisely the combination of highly specialized knowledge and broad general learning to which Columbia has long been committed,"" BoHinget wrote in announcing the task force. While the task force is still in session—it will submit its recommendations at the end of this academic year — some students have clamored to make their voices heard on curricular changes they say should have come sooner and cannot wait longer. ""If Columbia prides itself in being a global institudon, then it comes as a shock to me that people graduate widiout being equipped to understand issues like poverty, different power systems in the world, and how we understand eac n odter,"" Christina Chen, CC 'O9, said. ""When we graduate, we're not in any way prepared to talk and engage in these issues."" Chen is part of a group of students on campus, many of whom are members of Students Promodng Empowerment and Knowledge, who claim that the University is failing to provide undergraduates with an education and environment that reflects a globalized world. For students like Chen, a Core Curriculum dominated by Western classics and an ethnic studies program that lags behind those of comparable institutions such as Harvard and Princeton are symptoms of Columbia's inability to modernize in a global arena. Peter Awn, aean of the School of General Studies and chair of the globalization working group within the task force, said that revision of the Core Curriculum is a main focus. ""I think we're going to try to make the requirements reflect where we are now and that we want to try to construct an ideal that students can respond to in a whole variety of ways,"" Awn said. Bollinger has also said diat gaining insight into the lives of others across the globe should be a critical focus of a Columbia undergraduate's education. ""1 don't have any doubt in my mind diat you as young people coming into a world that will be significandy different from the world that I live in, that you should be thinking about these kinds of issues [of global understanding] from the outset and it should be part of what we think of as the core experience,"" Bollinger said. While the Western-dominated syllabi of Contemporary Civilization and the Humanities requirements are a source of dispute, debate surrounding the 1994 addition of a Major Cultures requirement has also arisen. According to some students, faculty, and administrators, the requirement's focus on only one culture does not provide students with a truly global perspective. ""Of all the core requirements, the one with the question mark, or it's just getting antiquated, is Major Cultures,"" Awn said. He also referred to Major Cultures saying ""1 think it's the least nimble [Core requirement] and 1 m always suspicious of requirements which are just a list of courses. It's a Chinese Menu—you do one from A, you do one from [list B or C] and who decides?"" Additionally, Chen said that Major Cultures teaches students to lean about cultures from an outsider's perspective, presenting diem as isolated others, hindering, rather than advancing, a global understanding. According to her, disciplines such as ethnic studies, which examinethe role of ethnicity and minority narratives in American history, provide an understanding that is more essential to graduate with. ""It's important to look at ourselves, not just outward, but inward,"" Chen said. ""We're creating a dichotomy of W and 'them.'"" In addition to the Task Force for Undergraduate Education, the University has worked toward enabling students to graduate with an enhanced die global perspective in various other ways. In 2004, the University announced a massive diversity undertaking which included the appointment of Jean Howard as the University's first Vice Provost for Diversity Initiatives. Over the following three years, Howard directed the use of a $l5 million fond to hire 17 new faculty members from underrepresented groups in the arts and sciences. According to Geraldine Downey, who replaced Howard at the end of last summer, a diverse faculty is an essential step toward generating global thought. ""To me, its synonymous: global means diverse,"" Downey said. ""We can learn as a University to take our place in a global society through thinking about how to embrace and make central in the University people from many different backgrounds and perspectives.' Howard said she felt the diversity initiative was a strong statement from the administration that it is committed to this aspect of globalization. ""There are a lot of ways Columbia has made a permanent commitment — through money —to furthering diversity goals,"" Howard said, 'mis is a big commitment on part ofthe University. They have not been stingy."" Howard noted, though, that diversifying the cultural ' and national backgrounds of faculty will not generate real change unless matched by curricular changes. ""It [faculty diversity] won't solve the problems of the Core being primarily Eurocentric,"" she said. As the task force considers making changes that could significandy alter the landscape of a Core Curriculum steeped in tradition, members of the Committee on Global Thought, which was established by Bollinger in 2005 to study ways of making changes within the existing curriculum, has put forth its own recommendations. Carol Gluck, a member of die committee, said that Columbia has extraordinary untapped potential to globalize without adding any courses to the curriculum. The committee's recommendations for undergraduate education focused on how to incorporate global thought across the curriculum on a small, but critical, level. According to Gluck, the benefit of such changes is that diey could be implemented quickly and easily within almost every classroom in the University. Gluck recalled one student to whom the committee spoke who worked with her professor to redesign an Art Humanities assignment on the Parthenon to focus on the Taj Mahal. According to Gluck, changes on diis level have a far more profound impact on global understanding than narrowing a student's focus to one non-Western culture. ""We're looking to infuse it [global thought] as broadly and quickly as possible in a globalized context,"" she said. ""They [students] don't want to be assigned a part of the world. They want the interconnections.""

143,Art Humanities,Systemic Racism Here?,2 November 2007,"BY JONATHAN HOLLANDERLike many other members of the Columbia community, 1 was shocked by the response to the recent bias incidents on campus. However, mv dismay did not result from the actions of the administration, but rather from those of my fellow students, some of whom have seized upon recent events and twisted their meaning to reflect an activist political agenda. Not only do I believe that this smacks of political opportunism, but more seriously, it demeans the importance of the cause—opposition to racism—that these individuals supposedly represent. The first point that needs to be addressed is the assertion that racism at Columbia is nor only pervasive, but also condoned and tacidy encouraged by the University. In his Spectator article ""Not Just an Isolated Incident"" (Oct. 26), Andrew TilletSaks listed four racist incidents—and alleged several more —that pointed to systemic bigotry within the Columbia community. He then , made the assertion that Columbia was responsible for these abhorrent acts because of the racist climate created by the Core Curriculum and the administrations insensitive response to hate crimes. Before we accept this statement at face value, we should first apply some rational scrutiny in order to determine both the scope of the problem and its causes. Lets begin by assuming for a moment that all four of the racist events listed by Mr. TilletSaks were undeniably perpetrated by members of the Columbia community, despite the lack of evidence substantiating this claim. Either way, four racist incidents since 2004 in a University of 20,000 hardly seem systemic and institutionalized. Moreover, this doesn't even take into account the student turnover at Columbia, which would increase the number of students (and possible bigots). Compared with hate-crime statistics for New York City as a whole, racism at Columbia isactually less common. Columbia has a rate of .02 percent hate crimes per person (assuming 4 crimes divided by 20,000 people), while the city average is .024 percent (1900 crimes between 2000 and 2004 divided by 8 million people). Additionally, one should consider that many of the crimes in the New York City statistic reflect incidents of murder and physical assault, actions that thankfully have not occurred at Columbia. Even though racism at Columbia is less pervasive than in the city as a whole, I, like most reasonable individuals, consider any instances of racism to be too many This is why it is important to understand the causes behind these actions. During my two years at Columbia, I have consistently heard many activists argue that racism at Columbia is the result of the cultural insensitivity of the Core, combined with the University's ""hostile"" policies toward both ethnic students and academic departments. If the causes of bigotry were actually this simple, however, I doubt racism would be as troubling an issue as it truly is. Firstly, the idea that the Eurocentricity of the Core creates bigotry is fallacious for several reasons. One of them is that the Core is not as Eurocentric as some activists would have us believe. The Core includes four classes that could be reasonably considered Eurocentric Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. However, this is offset by the two Major Cultures classes and four semesters of foreign languages, which are designed to be diver-sity-building elements. Yet, even if we do assume for a moment that the Core is Eurocentric, how does this engender racism? Are we to allege that every bigot on this campus is a student of4ooo-per-son Columbia College, spurred to action because of the cultural insensitivity of the Core? This question actually leads us to the larger issue of what motivates a racist. Does someone hang a noose on a door because they feel thatColumbia University's lack of funding to the Afri-can-American studies department legitimizes their anions? Or rather, is it because of emotional and social insecurity, isolation, and most importandy, ignorance? Ultimately, when we use reason—the foundation of CC—to examine these outrageous contentions, we quickly see that they are little more than crass political moves designed more to elicit emotion than rational discourse. The final point to consider is the University's attitude toward racism as a whole. Columbia's administration has been routinely attacked for its supposed intransigence in response to hate crimes. However, what exacdy would be an appropriate response? Would University President Lee Bollinger's presence at an anti-racism rally seriously make it any more effective? To assert that Lee Bollinger—the man who defended affirmative action in the Supreme Court—is not just insensitive to minority issues, but is actually a closet racist, is absurd. The administration's actions have been motivated by the correct belief that the appropriate response to hate crimes is to allow the police to investigate, apprehend, and prosecute the offenders. Fundamentally, Columbia University is not a racist institution. Slavery, segregation, and the Holocaust were all racist events—Manhattanville is not. Racism is a powerful charge, and just because activists need something to protest does not give them the right to makelibelous accusations against their own University. Hijacking issues and incidents by labeling them as examples of racism is a dangerous tactic. It not only limits the open discourse of our University community, but more importandy, it demeans the value of die term, so that when real racist events do occur, they don't receive the consideration they deserve.

144,Art Humanities,"College Offers Mini-Courses for Far-Flung, Nostalgic Alumni",27 March 2008,"BY KATIE DUNN Columbia Daily SpectatorAs Columbia College students reluctandy settle back in from spring break, they might be surprised to hear that their predecessors are eagerly signing up for a chance to revisit the Core Curriculum. The Columbia College Alumni Association launched a program last spring to offer to alumni clusters of classes based on Columbia courses including Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Frontiers of Science. Each mini-course is more than simply a Sparknotes- style refresher. Rather than following curricula prescribed by their on-campus colleagues, faculty members work specifically to apply the texts they teach to todays society. According to Executive Director of Alumni Affairs Ken Catandella, one of the programs key organizers, a given class might ""take Hobbes, Voltaire, and Plato, and apply them to the free market economy."" ""The mini-courses try to take the essence of the core and apply it to die reality of the world for alumni,"" Catandella said. Organizers see this approach as an important tool in making courses designed for college freshmen relevant to more seasoned learners. ""Their [alumni's] perspective on life when they read these materials is a little bit different, because they've been out of school and have actually had more real life experience,"" Executive Assistant of Alumni Affairs Mia Gonsalves explained. The program began two years ago, when three brief core reviews were offered at a Columbia College reunion. The enthusiastic response led to the creation of mini-courses last spring. The sessions are currendy offered in New York and Washington, D.C., and an abbreviated, one-class pilot program is being planned for Chicago this spring. More cities may soon follow. Deborah Martinsen, associate dean of Columbia College and lecturer for one such course, attributes the alumni demand for mini-classes to whatshe calls ""Core nostalgia"" and ""Core envy."" The latter, she said, expresses the sentiments of alumni members' friends and spouses, who complain they lack the critical-thinking skills the Core is designed to impart. Currently, the program is open to all CC alumni, who are also free to sign up their spouses and friends. Martinsen noted that her last class included a wide range of ""alumni from the class of 1951 to the class of 2005."" Catandella also proposes another reason for alumni interest in the mini-courses—that they provide intellectual engagement with the academic interests of todays undergraduates. ""They [alumni in the program] feel connected to what the students are doing currendy,"" he said, citing the offering of recent Cote addition Frontiers of Science, which was not available to many of the alumni involved in the program. Unlike those taught in Hamilton, the minicourses are a veritable bargain —$150 for three sessions, which typically include a small meal. In the midst of the Capital Campaign, the major CC fundraising drive launched last fall, organizers said they hope that the program Will also encourage donations. ""This really is a relational activity, although I suspect that happy alums and engaged alums are more likely to be donors,"" Catandella said. ""In that respect, I imagine it's connected. It's not really an outcrop of the campaign."" The often-bimonthly sessions last two hours each and typically occur in the evenings at the volunteered offices of alumni participants. Much like Core classes taught at the University, classes consist of small groups of 20 to 25 alumni. While the classes will not count toward any degree or certificate, Catandella said alumni receive a different sort of compensation. ""When alumni are able to be challenged again by the Cote Curriculum at the place in their lives that they ate today,"" he explained, ""there is a real sense of coming home, intellectually coming home."" news@columbiaspectator. com"
145,Art Humanities,"VIDEO GAMES No Need to Crack a Textbook-All You Need Is a Game, a Controller, and Something to Study For",1 May 2008,"No Need to Crack a Textbook-All You Need Is a Game, a Controller, and Something to Study ForBY JOE SAIA Spectator Staff WriterAfter the drink-happy hours of reading week have waned and the oppressive superstructure of finals week have begun to weigh on the collective Columbian conscience, casual and hard-core video gamers alike might be tempted to throw up their arms in desperation. They might exclaim that their favorite interactive hobby just has no place in their pursuits as aspiring academics, business people, and financial analysts. What those students would fail to' realize, though, is that video games can actually be a very productive means of expediting their intellectual, academic, and career pursuits. While that may sound strange, the fact of the matter is that you need some way todecompress mid-study session so that your intellectually saturated cranium doesn't spring a major leak. Video games are a great way to wind down while soaking up some useful intellectual and artistic tidbits of the potentially exam-salvaging nature. Either that, or they will just provide an amusing distraction without even forcing you to get off of the couch on which you've been carefully studying Foucault for the past 10 days. So take a break and try out some of these academically inclined games —sorted below by pertinence of subject area—during your finals crunch, and I promise that you'll be less stressed and will still eventually get into Harvard Law. Exam: Art Humanities Final. Study Solution: Okami for Wii and PS2 — Capcom's Zelda-esque adventure masterpiecestats an ancient Japanese wolf-god and is saturated with beautifully imaginative environments and a stunning watercolor visual style that truly makes it one of the most aesthetically artistic games ever released. Okami is perfect, in other words, for developing your artistic sensibility and honing your ability to ""appreciate"" less awesome artworks by old dead white men for your Art Hum exam. Exam: Economics Final. Study Solution: Bioshock for Xbox 360 and PC —A daunting mixture of free-market analyses, supply-and-demand diagrams, and federal banking networks getting you down? Bioshock's sophisticated story line, rife with political and economic commentary, will surely help prepare you for the exam and help you do better than the inevitable class average of 32. The lastboss fight even pits you against an evil capitalist entrepreneur wbo is enslaving and oppressing thousands of young minds in an attempt to further his own personal power trip (i.e. it will be very similar to your Econ final). Exam: Calc 111 Final. Study Solution: Professor Layton and the Curious Village for Nintendo DS— Professor Layton will prep you for your tough-as-balls Calc 111 final by challenging you with a series of simple geometric puzzles! Or, at the very least, the game's mixture of adventure and mind-stimulating math problems will get your brain cells humming in preparation for your professor's nasty essay question about gammavariable derivative tangential equations. You can even download additional challenges off the Internet for those of you who get somekind of sick pleasure from the perpetual use of your brains. Exam: Literature Humanities Final. Study Solution: Mass Effect for Xbox 360 —The reason I recommend this storyfocused sci-fi shooter as preparation for your Lit Hum final is threefold: 1) you can woo a lover by the end of the game, so it's a little bit like Pride and Prejudice , 2) you get to slaughter lots of big, burly bad guys, so it mirrors the Iliads plot pretty closely, and 3) you can custom name the main character ""Plato and thus make the game instantly relevant in terms of remembering what the hell the Symposium and the Apolopi were about. Add in the fact that the games choose-your-own-path structure isincredibly fun and expansive, and you have a game that should absolutely be incorporated into your literary study Exam: Any kind of Oral Final Exam. Study Solution: Rock Band for Xbox 360, PS3, and PS2— Rock Bandwill substantially improve your ability to verbally fabricate complete bullshit on the spot by forcing you to recite the lyrics to classic rock songs into your television screen over and over again. Sound strange? When you realize that you'll be singing songs like ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" by Jet and ""Gimme Shelter"" by the Rolling Stones, you'll understand more clearly why memorizing the wordsto these songs would be of immense value in improvising during your Women's Studies 101, Third World Poverty, and Social Injustices oral finals. Exam: Organic Chemistry Final. Study Solution: Nothing —You're screwed in every possible way. No amount of video-game-playing, intelligence, studying, or aptitude for that matter, can help you."
146,Art Humanities,Taking it Outside how Columbia's art history department uses new york city,9 October 2008,"how Columbia's art history department uses new york cityby Helene EisensteinPHOTO BY JESSICA FREEMANField trips did not go extinct after apple picking in third grade, roller skating in fifth grade, or even visiting the White House in eighth grade. Thanks to the Columbia and Barnard Art History Departments, field trips are actually mandatory for a large percentage of the University population. With the Columbia University ID working as a virtually universal free pass to culture and art, students explore the New York art scene not only outside of class, but also during the school day as part of class trips and individual assignments. The mission statement of the Barnard Art History Department reads, ""The department, fortunate in being located in New York City, one of the world's great art centers, takes full advantage of the rich resources of the city's museums and galleries in its course of study."" After speaking with Holger Klein, director of Art Humanities, Elizabeth Perkins, a current Art Humanities instructor, and several Columbia and Barnard students, it seems that the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Frick Collection are the most highly sought-out art spaces for class outings. The Met is utilized for its Greek galleries, which relate to the Art Humanities unit on the Parthenon, MoMA comes into play with the discussion of Jackson Pollock and Pablo Picasso, and the Frick is used for an individual paper assignment to discuss a specific piece of art or gallery space. Some instructors encourage students to incorporate a gallery in SoHo into their paper assignments, while others urge students to trek uptown and write about the Cloisters.Indeed, the passions and interests of particular instructors certainly influence their classes' destinations. Holger Klein went so far as to call the Metropolitan Museum of Art the true gem of the New York art community. Why? No matter Western, East Asian, African, or Indian art, the Met has a gallery dedicated to the finest antiquities and pieces of its kind. ""There aren't many places in the U.S. where you have collections of suchmagnitude,"" says Klein. ""The Met is only one example of the great resources that New York has to offer. We are preparing not just scholars and academics, but also future curators to museums."" Breaking out of the Western tradition, New York has an impressive repertoire of galleries devoted to non-Western art. Classes ranging from Masterpieces of Indian Art and Architecture to Japanese Prints and Contemporary African Art immerse themselves in art that originated thousands of miles from Manhattan at the Asia Society, the Museum for African Art, and the International Asian Art Fair. Klein adds, ""All of the great programs on the East Coast take advantage of art in New York. It adds a completely new dimension to learning that is invaluable."" According to Elizabeth Perkins, the class visits are designed for the students to ""immerse themselves in the art, walking around a sculpture that was otherwise two-dimensional on class slides and studying textures far too subtle to see on reproductions."" Furthermore, she notes that class visits focus on the layout and setup of a temporary or permanent exhibition itself, seeing where and how pieces are displayed. - For those students seeking more than the two-museum visit limit the Core Curriculum Office enforces on Art Humanities classes, there are special courses offered at Barnard and Columbia that completely immerse themselves in museum culture. The Culture of Public Art and Display in NYC is an anthropology seminar that focuses on the visual, social, and cultural aspects of specific New York museums and public art venues. Barnard's outreach into the art community extendsto the International Center of Photography, where select seniors choose from a smattering of photography craft classes and show their work as part of their senior visual arts concentration thesis projects. While most art classes meet regularly at an on-campus location and occasionally travel out of Morningside Heights for art, Maryan Ainsworth's Introduction to Connoisseurship is held at the Met every Monday. With an emphasis on how to judge art, particularly paintings, there is virtually no better place than the Met to study materials, technique, and condition through the eyes of a connoisseur. Meeting on Monday mornings, when the museum is closed to the general public, it is no surprise that the class is exposed to VIP tours and plenty of behind-the-scenes action. As a first year, Jennifer Abrams, GS/JTS 'lO, was initially overwhelmed by the thought of studying pieces in the Met for Art Humanities. But she found that the assignment actually served to narrow her focus and make the encyclopedic museum a bit more approachable. ""I thought it was really helpful to go to the Met with a purpose in mind,"" she says. ""Just going to browse is kind of daunting, but to go with a certain lens is easier."" According to Perkins, it's common for firstyears to have no idea how to approach a museum such as the Met, and Art Humanities opens them up to the New York art scene, teaching them how to put these skills to good use long after the semester ends. Perkins says, ""I count a museum visit as a success if even one student e-mails me after the semester regarding a gallery or exhibition that they recently visited."" V""WE ARE PREPARING NOT JUST SCHOLARS AND ACADEMICS, BUT ALSO FUTURE CURATORS TO MUSEUMS.""Some art history classes meet exclusively off campus, utilizing museums when they are closed to the rest of the public."

148,Art Humanities,The Value of Diversity for International Students,10 November 2008,"BY AMIN GHADIMIFor an international student like me, there is no place like Columbia. Harvard sits atop the U.S. News and World Report rankings, Georgetown has an impressive international relations program, and Oxbridge costs significantly less than 50,000 dollars a year, but none of that really matters. With its pedagogical philosophy and its approach to the concept of education, Columbia offers a truly singular international education. We all know that Columbia values diversity. We experience it for the first time during NSOP week. We see it on College Walk. We hear it in our Core class discussions. We deal with it so much that it may even become banal to us. But it is perhaps only the international student who, because of his or her ostensible foreignness, appreciates how important this diversity is. Internationals are often told about the difficulties of adjusting to a new school and a new country at the same time. Before sending its students abroad, my high school in Japan organized a ""senior transition meeting"" in which it warned seniors of the potential culture shock we would experience in a new country. During NSOP week, I joined my fellow international students in a meeting that exposed us to the different climate of ""the American classroom."" Though certainly helpful, both meetings were superfluous. Columbia's commitment to diversity offers everyone, including me, a comfort zone and a place to feel at home—but not a crevice in which to hide from exposure to different and even conflicting and provocative viewpoints. For me, Columbia's dedication to diversity speaks to my religious identity as a member of the Bahai Faith. On April 12, 1912, Columbia University opened Earl Hall to the Son of the Founder of my religion. He delivered a speech in which he addresseda common element of Columbian philosophy and my faith: he said, ""It is our duty to put forth our greatest efforts and summon our energies from all directions in order that the bonds of unity and accord may be established among mankind."" Columbia demonstrated a commitment to diversity almost a century ago in giving one of the central figures of the Bahai Faith a platform to speak from, and this commitment still resonates; in last year's World Leaders Forum, President Bollinger raised the question of the persecution of Baha'is in Iran in his address to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It is at Columbia that I find my religious beliefs acknowledged and respected. With such a commitment to diversity here, assimilation is not difficult—in fact, there really is no need to assimilate. At the same time, and perhaps more importantly, Columbia's diversity provokes just as it welcomes. Last week, President Bollinger welcomed Sir Salman Rushdie to the inauguration of the Institute of Religion, Culture, and Public Life at Columbia. Last year, to the World Leaders Forum on the same campus, he welcomed President Ahmadinejad, who represents a regime that seeks to put Sir Rushdie to death. Does diversity then become a self-contradiction —can we, for the sake of diversity, paradoxically tolerate those who cannot tolerate diversity? What does this mean for an international student who may bring with him or her ideas and beliefs that conflict with those prevalent at Columbia? How do we reconcile the contradictions diversity engenders? I feel that Columbia seeks to answer these questions —or rather, to force us to answer these questions —in part through the Core Curriculum. Frontiers of Science seeks to train us to think rationally and scientifically, while Art Humanities makes us look at the world from a diametrical perspective. Literature Humanities is steeped in Western culture, while the Global Core seeks to compensate for that. It is asif Columbia's emphasis on diversity of thought and analysis of different points of view is tailored for international students. Columbia teaches us how to synthesize the different cultures and ideas we were exposed to in our upbringing, thereby reconciling them. In this way, I believe that internationals almost viscerally feel the importance of having this exposure to diversity—it speaks to a central part of our identity to think about education as a means of appreciating and solving the question of diversity. It is true that Columbia is, in all its racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural heterogeneity, a microcosm of New York City and of the United States. The diversity we encounter in the city complements and enhances that we experience on campus, while the election of Senator Obama to the Presidency makes any talk of the importance of diversity to the identity of America entirely redundant. But to dismiss Columbia's diversity simply as a reflection of its surrounding culture is to fail to give the University adequate credit. The creation, maintenance, and fostering of the diversity on which we pride ourselves is difficult and controversial, but for the international student especially, that commitment to diversity is invaluable. That Columbia respects diversity but is never afraid to question and challenge it makes it a global leader in international education and the obvious choice for internationals thinking about which college to attend. Any international student can probably attest to being stalked and spammed in high school by admissions officers preaching about how they seek to diversify their campuses—something Columbia has already done and continues to do. This commitment to an international student body is important, for it is from the style of education at Columbia that global solutions to the most pressing global questions emerge.

149,Art Humanities,The Community As a Classroom,26 January 2009,"BY JAIMIE LEEAs Columbia students, we are seeking an education. As young people, we are straddling the blurry and often frustrating division between independent adults and naive youth. Like Jack Kerouac in On the Road , we struggle to find ourselves while enjoying the mayhem and spontaneity of growing up. In serious professional settings, however, we still feel out-of-place and inexperienced. There is only one field where we are allowed to play with the big hitters—it is a place where our absurd idealism and fiery determination to prove ourselves merge perfectly, and although it sounds so simple, the issue of service is one that pertains personally and professionally to every student on campus. Many of us imagine ourselves as head honchos or medical bigwigs who direct a team of local statf and hold the fate of a company or a life in our hands. Others view themselves as philanthropic vagabonds who sing several languages and interact with locals. How, we ask ourselves, are we going to reach that vision? In Community Impact, we work in teams to organize our club activities, recruit members, and answer to our parent organization and financiers. As leaders, we are part sales, public relations, secretary,and treasury. We often engineer ways to improve communication and content. If the boss is not pleased, your club might literally be terminated, and if they want you to do better, you could be put on probation. In organized service, we are accountable to parent organizations as well as the public we serve, and although our Art Humanities class will help us learn the difference between Rembrandt and Picasso, no formal education can prepare us for the pressure and reward of heading our own service opportunities. Through Health Education Awareness League (HEAL), I teach health to a class of seventh graders with wild imaginations. As soon as I get home, I crash. It is exhausting to grab and hold the attention of 30 12-year-olds. Planning and coordinating each little aspect of the presentation can feel like composing a symphony in less than one hour. Whenever I visit my class, I wonder if I was as curious and intuitive during my seventh grade. I flash back to my Winnie the Pooh shirt that I religiously wore until ninth grade, and something tells me that these kids been given the opportunity to receive education that I never received. I get that warm and fuzzy feeling that makes me roll my eyes whenever I hear about it from anyone else. Volunteering has also brought me closer to the people in my community, through hearing their stories. I once saw a movie in which Merlin is a feeble old wizard and tells his legendary tales of King Arthur and his court in public for change from passers-by. I wanted to be in his audience and relive the myths of honor, war, and love. I am still captivated by stories, and luckily, I have manypeople who are eager to share theirs with me. I used to visit an elderly, housebound friend named Hope. For hours, I would listen to her reminisce about old New York. We would watch classic movies, and she would turn to me and share how she once saw Katharine Hepburn perform on stage or how Lauren Bacall was very pleasant. Now, I tutor a Thai immigrant named Plaiwan, and 1 structure our lessons so that she begins each week by writing a paragraph on her life. I tell her that this assignment will help her writing skills, but what I am really interested in is unraveling her story. Education and isolation are like oil and water. It is impossible to receive a complete and rewarding education without first-hand experience in the real world. In our gated campus on our quiet Morningside Heights community, it is easy to forget that there is another world surrounding us. In this foreign domain, people hunch their backs in shame as they walk toward their local food shelter with their children trailing them. In this alien planet, community members wait for hours in Medicaid lines for assistance so that they can afford their weekly insulin. Indeed, it is a strange place outside our Ivy League bubble, but we must venture out and force ourselves to interact with the disadvantaged, unkempt, crazy, and has-beens because most of the time, we discover that we have much to learn from them. Otherwise, we can never say that we have actually lived in the city. The author is a junior in the School of Engineering and Applied Science.

150,Art Humanities,What's your GPA?,24 September 2009,"An hour and a half of remedial math, some teenagers struggling to perform at grade level, some understimulated, everyone bored, an incompetent teacher who delegates the responsibility for class control and pedagogy to her more able, I mean more obsequious, students—and it's universally mandatory until the end of the semester. Public high school? Hell no—this was Frontiers of Science, and what I described above constituted my very first step into the Styx of higher education. Looking back on it, learning anything from the class was out of the question. My seminar leader was wretched, and education for the sake of education is simply not possible when there's a requirement that nearly everyone hates. I could have gotten something out of it, though: a grade; so I'm only a little embarrassed that after discovering I got a B-plus—-this after a late burst of sitting in the front, evincing interest, completing 'independent projects,' 'taking the initiative,' pretending to buy into 'peer learning,' and attaching clip-art to my homework—l considered transferring. This might have been good for Columbia and me, but I was rejected from everywhere I wanted to go because my grades were mediocre. It's like how SEAS will let you bow out, but you have to have the grades to do it. Many of my later bad grades have been my own fault, but not all of them. Learningshould always be the goal of a class. But if requirements curb curiosity and force venality, then they should at least be equitable in their student assessments. They aren't. CULPA pages are littered with reviews attesting to this. The grades issue is, I'm sure, tied to another way in which requirements are bungled: grad students. Grad students teach Art Humanities, Music Humanities, University Writing, and some teach Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations too, not to mention the introduction classes for your major. We might as well throw away the pretense that these are the most important classes of college if full professors aren't teaching them. But grad students —speaking very broadly—are bad in another way. They grade oddly and capriciously, more on effort than capability. An A-minus and a B-plus are often the only available marks. Everyone is above average, but only by so much. I suspect this is based on insecurity. Grad students are the antithesis of'too cool for school.' A friend and I conducted a post-mortem of our Art Hum instructor. He said that ""she was a tough grader for someone who didn't demonstrate very acute intelligence."" There has to be some way of demonstrating their superiority. It comes at the undergrads' expense —we are, after all, the paying customers. A less pressing issue is the imbalance in grades between different departments. Your GPA can be determined more by your major than by your talent and effort. This could be cut down by eliminating the A-plus. Which other school has these? They flourish only in our quantitative departments. All our valedictorians and salutatorians come from fields that give lousy speeches. If your abilities are really so remarkable, an A should be enough, and ifyou're working hard enough to get an A-plus, you're wasting your time. Academic success should come as a happy accident—not from hours of miserable travail. After applying a certain amount of effort, you start to hit diminishing returns. A race to the top in GPA is a race to the bottom in learning. This brings me to the problem at hand. Your GPA is a poor metric of what you got out of your experience, and an even poorer one for what you will get out of future experiences. This wouldn't be a concern if Professor Peter Bearman's cliche that 'your grades in college do not matter' was true. But it isn't. Bearman assigns them anyway, and they do matter —for grad school, for jobs, for whatever you will do after college. People talk a lot about grades at Columbia. The proof of their primacy is in the talking. On my visits to Reed, Pomona, and Amherst, the topic has been taboo—they are as meaningless and as seldom talked about as SAT scores. But our culture here has much more in common with a big, public research university than a small liberal arts college. The Darwinian market of New York exerts its workaholic pull. We are encouraged to compare ourselves to others, not others to ourselves, and find one or the other wanting. 'Comparisons are odious,' goes the old platitude. But what else do we have? 1 think the big lesson here is that people care about grades here as a means of asserting themselves over an experience over which they may have very little control. As in the case of this column, it is self-defeating. Chris Morris-Lent is a Columbia College senior majoring in English.

151,Art Humanities,"HOMER, PLATO... SPIELBERG? is film ready for its core close-up?",8 October 2009,"is film ready for its core close-up?by Daniel ValellaILLUSTRATION BY DARYL SEITCHIKWhat truly lies at the core of the Core Curriculum? It covers literature, philosophy, music, painting, architecture, science, and language. It aims at teaching every student in the College the principles and foundations of Western art and civilization. But something's missing: a combination of all of the above. Namely, film. The study of film encompasses the study of screenplays, soundtracks, philosophical agendas, technological production, and much more, making it a medium that comprises almost every other kind of media. Keeping this in mind, should a class devoted entirely to film—""Film Humanities,"" maybe—ever become part of the Core? While the idea of ""Film Hum"" may not be universally accepted quite yet, film has already made its way into the Core as a supplement to Columbia students' study of literature and the arts. Holger Klein, associate professor of art history and archaeology believes in cinema's ability to enhance course material. That's why he decided last year to inaugurate a kind of miniature film festival for Art Hum students. ""Because individual Art Hum instructors often show movies in connection with their Art Hum classes that focus on Art Hum artists and themes,"" says Klein, ""I thought it might be a good idea to run a movie series open to all Art Hum sections instead."" Eric Anderson, Klein's assistant at the time and an advanced Ph.D. student in the department ofart history, selected films like ""Goya's Ghosts,"" ""Pollock,"" and ""I Shot Andy Warhol""—all of which relate to the artists covered in Art Humanities classes. These were shown from late October to early December 2008, making up the film series that came to be known as ""Art Hum at the Movies."" The response to the series, though, was underwhelming. ""Despite the fact that we ran advertisements in the Spectator and announced the movies in all Art Hum sections, the movie series was, unfortunately, not very well attended, with usually fewer than ten people [per movie],"" Klein says. ""We therefore decided not to run the series again in the same format this year but may revive it in the future.""More than a few Art Hum instructors were surprised by the series' low turnout, believing that students would embrace the addition of film to their current studies. But the biggest problem with ""Art Hum at the Movies"" may not have been lack of interest. The five movies screened were shown in Schermerhorn on weeknights at 7PM—very likely the number-one reason students didn't attend. Despite the failure of the series, most students recognize that a film like ""Pride and Prejudice"" could enhance a Lit Hum class, for example, while a film like ""Amadeus"" would serve well in a Music Hum class. Of course, showing film in an already-existing Core class isn't the same as devoting a whole class to the subject. Many students do love the idea of a ""Film Hum,"" though, and they would like to see the Core eventually include such a course. ""It would be a good idea to add film to the repertoire of our required studies at Columbia,"" says Carolina Martes, a Columbia College sophomore. ""It's an easily relatable and enjoyable subject, so I think students would enjoy it very much if it were added to the Core Curriculum."" Cliff Massey, president of the College's senior class and a student representative to the Committee on the Core Curriculum, agrees. ""I think the Core would be greatly enhanced by involving film, as film is another medium of expression, equal now in our society in stature and scholarship to literature and music,"" he says. Not all students are on the same page, though. Even if they agree that the medium is indeed valid for study, some say it's not quite at the same level of academic importance as the literature, music, philosophy, or the other plastic arts (architecture, painting, or sculpture, for example) currently part of the curriculum. ""Film doesn't have the legacy that the other stuff in the Core carries with it,"" says Joe Marano, a College sophomore and film major. ""Film has become so ingrained in our culture so fast that it's worth studying in college, but there shouldn't be an entire Core class devoted to it. It would be cool—it's just not worthy of being part of the Core.- It's not of the same magnitude as music or literature."" Massey, on the other hand, believes that the study of film is integral to the Core's purpose—and that leaving it out of the curriculum is a big loss. ""The importance of film to the very nature of the Core is so great that rumors and whispers have already started circulating amongst students about the desire for the addition of a film class to the Core requirements,"" he says. ""While that addition might be many years down the road, I think it, too, is something worth pursuing. "" To know that ""How Green Was My Valley"" won the Best Picture Oscar in 1941 or to recognize a photo of Barbara Stanwyck may not matter as much as knowing Dante like the back of your hand, but if film itself is a multifaceted amalgam of all that we consider ""worthy of study,"" it doesn't make sense to ignore it from an academic perspective. A ""Film Hum"" class wouldn't just be cool—it would be an important addition to the Core that would affect generations of wellrounded Columbians to come. •SHOWING FILM IN A CORE CLASS ISN'T THE SAME AS DEVOTING A WHOLE CLASS TO THE SUBJECT,"
152,Art Humanities,ART HO-HUM what the core doesn't teach you,5 November 2009,"what the core doesn't teach youBY Hannah YudkinILLUSTRATION BY IGOR SLMIC""We learn about the big names—Michelangelo, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso. But we just don't know the others because it's not what we're taught,"" a friend of mine told me a few weeks ago. When he asked me if I could name five modern or contemporary artists; I eagerly rambled off some noteworthy names—Cindy Sherman, Vito Acconci, Carolee Schneemann, Patty Chang, Bill Violanames that were famous, at least, to an art history student like me. But when 1 asked my friend to name a few artists he knew, he sat in silence, unable to come up with anything but the usual Art Hum suspects. Art awareness at Columbia is low. When I ask students around campus the same set of questions—Can you name any contemporary artists? Have you been to a gallery show lately? Whatdo you think of the Kara Walker installation in Dodge? ! get the same blank, quizzical looks. This doesn't mean, however, that people aren't aware of what art is. As a matter of fact, most students on campus are required as part of Columbia's Core Curriculum to take Art Humanities. Just like the rest of the core, Art Hum is meant simply to familiarize students with art, and in doing so, to encourage further exploration of the subject. There are, of course, things ""which a man must experience and understand if he is to be called educated,"" as the core's mission statement so eloquently puts it. And although the course has its setbacks, it generally succeeds in fulfilling this mantra. Art Hum teaches students about the major moments in art history by looking at and discussingimportant figures like Rembrandt, Leonardo da Vinci, Goya, Monet, Picasso, and Frank Lloyd Wright, The class asks students to look at art in a way that is less daunting than, say, a class on the avant-garde—-a topic that would certainly scare off any Columbia student unfamiliar with art. For art newcomers, Art Hum proves to be the perfect introductory course. Eleanor Shi, a junior at Columbia College, says that Art Hum made her want to study art history further. Although she had already been an avid museum-goer, her knowledge of art beyond what she had seen in museums was slim. Shi says that the class ""presents you with a different way of looking at art and from that, gives you the chance to appreciate art."" She later decided to take Twentieth Century Art with Branden Joseph, which convinced her that her passion lay with art history. Shi does warn, however, that ""Art Hum is not indicative of art history ... I think it's really impossible to learn all of Western art in a semester."" Ariel Brenman, who graduated from Columbia last year, says that the class ""turned me onto things I didn't know I liked."" Furthermore, by requiring students to go on three museum trips throughout the semester (to MoMA, the Met, and one of their own choosing), the course encourages active participation in the art world. Brenman discovered his favorite work—Rembrandt's ""Aristotle with a Bust of Homer""—because of Art Hum. But beyond the classroom, Art Hum doesn't seem to make much of a dent at Columbia. Thecourse may inspire people like Shi to major or concentrate in art history, but that is the exception, not the rule. Often, those in the class aren't even interested in taking it. Some juniors and seniors are simply there to get it over with. What makes matters worse is that Art Hum isn't designed to get people interested in the art of today. What the course lacks is a focus on contemporary art —the art that fills today's museums and galleries and drives critical conversation. That's somewhat understandable, though, considering that the course has to cover all of Western art in a semester. The problem of art awareness, then, may lie in the fact that we, as students, are not taught what is currently going on in the art world. And even if professors do mention modern and contemporary art in class, they have to squeeze it in at the end. Instead, we are left in the dark when it comes to everything that comes after Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock. As a result, modern and contemporary art just doesn't seem to fit into the art vocabulary with which many students new to art are familiar. As Barnard professor Alexander Alberro says, ""Many people are not interested in modern and contemporary art, and even more distrust it. So why should they know the names of artists? The ones they know are the names of the artists who have most effectively used publicity—the relentless self-promoters. So someone like Jeff Koons or Damien Hirst will be known, but much more interesting artists will not."" Why would people, then, be compelled to go to a gallery downtown or an exhibit at the New Museum if the art they'll see there is indecipherable to them? ""Most people only want a very limited knowledge of art,"" Alberro says. ""They believe that it's important to know the basics so that they can talk about it at dinner parties, but don't care about it enough to know more. Therefore, 'the greatest hits' will do."" With art, ignorance seems to be bliss. Although some people may decide to remain removed from the art culture of New York because they find it uncomfortable, others find it impossible to keep up with what's going on because of the nature ofbeing a student at Columbia. For many, going to a gallery or a museum and discovering new art is an exhaustingly cerebral experience. ""I think the Columbia academia setting makes it that if you have one Saturday free, you don't want to do something that involves extra thought,"" says Barnard junior Katie Strieker.Others, like Bianca Perta, also a junior at Barnard, are simply not drawn to art museums and galleries. ""I'm not an art person,"" she says. ""I like the Museum of Natural History more."" But when asked whether she had visited that museum recently, Perta said no.What Columbia students seem to be suffering from is something more than just a remove from the art world at large. Rather, it's a remove from the world outside of Morningside Heights. Many of us don't have the time or interest to go see art. The art, then, must be brought to us. Luckily, there are galleries and groups on campus that are attempting to do just that. The Miriam & Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery in Schermerhorn Hall is one such venue. The gallery brings attention to contemporary debates in art, as well as debates outside the realm of the art history discourse. Last semester, an exhibit titled ""Modernism and Iraq"" featured modernist artworks from Iraq's museum in Baghdad, which was looted in 2003 during the first months of the war. The current show discusses the controversial new Parthenon museum in Athens. These topics are interesting not only to those studying art history, but also to students majoring in subjects like political science, archeology, ancient studies, anthropology, sociology, and Middle Eastern languages and cultures. Despite its proximity and accessibility, many students are still unaware that Wallach even exists. ""Wait, there's a gallery there?"" says Brenman. And those who do know rarely make the trek up to the Bth floor. Postcrypt, the undergraduate-run art gallery that holds its shows in the basement of St. Paul's Chapel, is trying to combat this lack of interest in art by giving people incentive to pay attention to it. For one, art openings always feature free wine.""We do get a decent proportion of newcomers who are clearly out of their element and came primarily for the free wine,"" says lan Kwok, president of the group and a senior at Columbia College. ""And we totally approve, by the way."" Maybe all people need in order to see a contemporary art exhibit is one small push. But, of course, a class isn't necessarily going to make students want to go down to Chelsea. Instead, Kwok brings the art to campus: ""One of our primary goals at Postcrypt Art Gallery is to integrate students—both artists and art appreciators—into contemporary art culture. This involves leading gallery hops, giving students a chance to curate shows and organize public art installations, and simply talking about art in a contemporary context."" For art awareness to increase on campus, art needs to follow Postscrypt's model and become accessible, exciting, and relevant. Art Hum attempts to do this, but it fails to make people curious about how art functions today. Alberta Wright, a senior at Barnard College, offers a simple remedy: Students should view art, especially the art we learn about in classes, as an ""avenue to learn other things."" Art, says Wright, can relate to everything in some way—be it biology, anthropology, or philosophy. Connecting art to academic disciplines or current events may not be a goal of Art Hum, but perhaps it should be. For people to appreciate art, they first have to be convinced that it matters. 9"
153,Art Humanities,Lit Hum a year later,16 November 2009,"BY NEIL FITZPATRICKMuch has been said about the Core. It provides a firm grounding in the Western canon. It contains too many dead white males. It is a perfectly good cause for a hunger strike. It is one of the reasons that many students (including yours truly) came to Columbia. The Columbia College bulletin calls it ""the cornerstone of a Columbia education."" My roommate calls it ""a royal pain in the ass."" One of the things not often said about the Core, however, is that it is useful. The bulletin does offer that ""the skills and habits honed by the Core—observation, analysis, argument, imaginative comparison, respect for ideas, nuances, and differences —provide a rigorous preparation for life as an intelligent citizen in today's complex and changing world."" And this is true. University Writing could make you a better writer, and Lit Hum will certainly teach you how to read and analyze quickly (or at least improve your Sparknoting skills). But one might argue that the skills and values supposedly instilled by the Core —analysis, argument, respect for diverse ideas—could just as easily be imbued by an alternative course of study—say, one found at any of the other top universities. The fact is that it is the content of the Core that sets it apart, and the content of the Core which most people would hesitate to call ""useful."" The content of which I write is that of the first four courses introduced to the curriculum—Contemporary Civilizations, Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. They are classes chiefly concerned with the Western canon, and expose students to many of the great thinkers, writers, musicians, and artists of the Western world. The question is why. I am not, by any means, equipped to fully answer that question. As a sophomore, I have only completed one of the aforementioned classes: Lit Hum. Only time and chance will determine just how useful an education in the Core proves to be in the adult world of job markets and families. I can, however, attest to how useful the content of Lit Hum has been during my as-yet brief time in college. It began first semester freshman year, when I yialked into Modern Poetry, which I chose Bfe'iHiseTli'ked tWo of the poets mentioned in the course description, and not because I knew they were ""modernists,"" or because I had any real idea of what ""modernism"" was. The first lecture was a wake-up call—the first sign that my college education would be very, very different from my experience in high school. It took about two more sessions before the material stopped going over my head, and three more after that before I worked up the courage to raise my hand and participate. Most significant, though, was that as the semester wore on, my ability to analyze the poetry improved not just because I had been listening to my professor do analysis for months, but also because the works I was reading in Lit Hum were directly referenced in much of the modernist poetry we were studying. So when I came upon poems by Yeats like ""Adam's Curse"" or ""No Second Troy,"" my knowledge of Genesis and The Iliad helped me understand the context of the poems better than I ever could have from only reading the footnotes. The same was especially true later when we came to Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, both of whom referenced Homer, Ovid, and Dante so much that William Carlos Williams got sick of it all and decided to give the poet's version of a slap in a face by referencing a red wheelbarrow and some chickens. At least, I think that's what I was supposed to take away from the class. The education we are getting here with the Core—this grounding in the Western canonis not just knowledge that helps you seem smart at the proverbial cocktail party. Classes like Lit Hum add context to and enrich our education going forward. Even this year, in Contemporary Civilizations, Machiavelli references battles and historical figures straight out of Homer, Herodotus, and Thucydides. In Music Hum, we learn that Wagner, in writing opera, wanted to harken back to what he believed were the glory days of Ancient Greece, when, in the dramas we read in Lit Hum, all of the arts—literature, drama, music, dance, and gymnastics —were fused into one mode of expression. In psychology, we learn that Aristotle, of all people, could be considered the father of that field of study. Of course, one might argue that the content of the Core is only useful to people taking courses in the humanities, or only in the setting of other Core classes. And this is true to a certain degree—the literature read in Lit Hum may be more immediately useful to an aspiring English major than a math major. But to a large extent, the content of the Core offers context not just for ideas encountered in later academic settings, but also for the ideas that govern our world—why we study math, why we search for truth, how to best govern a state, how we can learn from history, what the purpose of art is, etc. It is this context which could be said to be the goal of education, the opposite of ignorance. It is what will allow us, both in our lives as college students, and perhaps even later in that world of job markets and families, to make informed decisions about any problems that cross our paths. And if, in the meantime, it helps me be a little less stupefied by ""The Wasteland""—well, I will take that too. The author is a Columbia College sophomore."
154,Art Humanities,Class increase for CC Deans confirm permanent shift,12 February 2010,"Deans confirm permanent shiftBY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Senior Staff WriterColumbia College confirmed on Thursday that it is permanently increasing its first year class size by 50, and administrators said they are working now to address the needs of a larger student body. For the class of 2013, Columbia College accepted 50 more first year students than it had in prior years, to create a class of roughly 1070 students, up from the previous norm of around 1020. And according to Kevin Shollenberger, the dean of student affairs, this increased class size will become the new standard, resulting in 200 more students entering the College over four years. The School of Engineering and Applied Science will not see any increases. The University wanted to ensure that the change in class size would not be problematic for students, Shollenberger said, adding that the decision was expedited because of the economy. Now, he confirmed, they ""are going to go forward with their plan"" to make this size permanent. Administrators did not comment on the specifics of the financial changes surrounding this increase. Michele MoodyAdams, the dean of Columbia College, said in an interview on Thursday morning of the financial implications, ""It depends. It's a very complicated calculus. It depends on who is in the class, what level of need they have or don't have."" Kathryn Yatrakis, the dean of academic affairs, said of the University's finances, ""I think we are faring better than some other universities but we have not escaped the economic situation."" She added that the University was able to go forward withcertain hirings while other peer institutions entirely halted. With the increase, administrators said they are currently discussing appropriate ways to address changing needs in housing, advising, and academics. Moody-Adams said, ""We are taking really seriously the need to do everything we can to ensure the quality of student experience."" She said the University's plan to decrease the ratio of advisors to students would not be affected. Yatrakis also said that they are committed to the 22 student limit per Core class. To accommodate the class of 2013, she said they added three sections of LiteratureHumanities and two sections of Art Humanities. They also raised the cap of 12 students for University Writing courses to 14, although Yatrakis said that only one section had 14 students this year while the average was 13. Despite next years large sophomore class, Yatrakis said that they do not think at this point that they need to increase the number of sections of Contemporary Civilization. ""We think there is enough spaces to accommodate individually one [student] per section, but we are going to monitor this very carefully,"" she said. The University has tried to monitor what courses sophomores tend to take, which Yatrakis described as""very difficult."" She also discussed the need to ""start migrating class schedules""to less normal times to create more possible classes for students to take. Right now, since classes are usually held only at certain times, class space quickly becomes an issue. ""One of our biggest challenges has less to do with the actual size of the incoming class but how much space we have to offer the courses that they take,"" Moody-Adams said. According to Shollenberger, financial aid will remain unaffected by the new class size. Scott Wright, vice president of student auxiliary and business services, said that to accommodate the second wave of additional students, the University will work on three major housing projects over the summer. In Harmony Hall, a space that was previously a superintendentsapartment, will be converted into undergraduate housing, which will generate room for five students. In Ruggles, seven singles will become doubles, adding seven new beds to the building. He said the change would be ""consistent throughout,"" by changing one single in seven different suites. And the largest change is in Mcßain, where the University will be ""converting and moving some walls in Mcßain"" to create 20 extra beds. For example, he said, two 300-square feet rooms will become three 200-square feet spaces. Additionally, some singles will be turned into doubles. Ultimately, Mcßain will have relatively few singles. It is uncertain whether these new spaces will be included in room selection, Wright said,adding, ""It may be assigned space later."" With around 60 empty beds at the start of fall semester this year, and the 32 additional beds from renovations, ""We believe we will have plenty to accommodate the now two year additional student base,"" Wright said. Wright also said that seniors and juniors who want singles will still be able to get them. But some students still expressed concern. Shana Yearwood, CC 'll, questioned the decision to add more students to an already crowded University. ""I feel like they're cramped for space as it is. ... I just feel bad for the freshmen who'll be crammed into doubles that used to be singles,"" Yearwood said. Last year, for the class of 2013,Housing Services converted Harmony Hall to undergraduate housing. In regards to the fourth year of additional students, Wright said that it is ""a little bit far in advance"" to discuss the changes. ""Every year there are changes to the number of living spaces Columbia is working with,"" Wright said, adding ""I don't know right now what the best options will be."" Other students said they were happy about the change. ""That's great,"" said Noam Prywes CC 'lO, who said he wasn't worried about crowding in houses or dorms, or resources being stretched thin. ""Maybe this'll make our acceptance more reasonable."" Leah Greenbaum contributed reporting. amber.tunnell @columbiaspectator.com"
155,Art Humanities,"New deans, new academics",10 May 2010,"BY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Senior Staff WriterAs new administrators settle into their positions, this year was the transition period that followed months—and in some cases years—of administrative searches. While Columbia's new dean and provost continue to shape their roles on campus, the undergraduate pool expanded with the economy —and a changing market pushed the Journalism School to also expand its areas of research. In an adjustment year for Columbia, departments renamed and re-alligned, as the University promoted the sciences, new media, and updated curricula. ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES After extensive and highprofile administrative searches that dragged through last year, Columbia experienced a transition period as new appointments settled into their roles. After Austin Quigley stepped down as Columbia College dean last year, Michele Moody-Adams—who was then vice provost for undergraduate education at Cornell University—became the first woman and the first African American to hold the post. Over the past year, she has become known to undergraduates for her philosophy lectures and her tea parties, similar to University President Lee Bollinger's fireside chats. And after a search that spanned two years, civil engineer Feniosky Pena-Mora—-formerly the associate provost of the University ofIllinois —was appointed dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Social psychologist Claude Steele took his place as provost, also becoming the first African American to hold the post. At the time, Steele was the Lucie Stern Professor in the Social Sciences at Stanford University and director of Stanford's Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. As for Steele, his style as provost is still in its formative stages. In recent interviews, Steele has suggested that he would like to take a more active role in budgeting. His predecessor, historian and former provost Alan Brinkley, saw control over budgetary decisions shift from the provost to the president and the newly created position of the senior executive vice president. MORE STUDENTS AND THE COMMON APP In February, the University announced that it would be increasing Columbia College's first-year class size permanently by 50 students to roughly 1,070 students per year, up from the previous of around 1,020 —a decision expedited by the economy, dean of student affairs Kevin Shollenberger said at the time. Last year's admission cycle, for the class of 2013, marked the first year of this increase. After reviewing how the change had affected the University initially, administrators decided to make it permanent. This will result in a total of 200 more students on campus after the first four years. Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that administrators had to make slight adjustments to Core Curriculum classes this past year to accommodate the larger freshman class. They added three sections of Literature Humanities and two sections of Art Humanities. They also raised the cap for University Writing courses from 12 students to 14, although Yatrakis said that only 'one section had 14 students this year, and the average was 13. She said that she did not foresee any changes being made for the Contemporary Civilization courses next year. . This year's admitted class was again the most selective in history, with a combined CC and SEAS admit rate of 9.16 percent. This is the last class that will be admitted through Columbia's unique application— beginning next year, Columbia will start using the Common Application instead. ""We offer one of the most generous need-based financial aid programs in the country and believe the Common Application will make applying to Columbia more accessible to students from every background,"" Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jessica Marinaccio wrote in a statement released in March. EXPANDING SCIENCE, CONFLICTING INTERESTS While student reaction to the required Frontiers of Science class has been notoriously mixed in the course's five-year run, this year the administration ensured that it would continue by renewing the course. The science department at Columbia also expanded this year, as construction continued on the Northwest Corner Building, located at the corner of 120 th Street and Broadway. Eight Columbia scientists were selected this past year to move into the new building, which will mainly consist of department laboratories. The University also plans to hire 13 new scientists, which makes a total of 21 scientists moving into the building. Kenneth Shepard from the electrical engineering department said in January that his new space will be significantly larger than his current space, which is cramped and crowded. He also said the Northwest Corner Building should ""help to create a lot of synergy between the physical sciences and life sciences"" at Columbia. But the future is not bright for all scientists at Columbia.This fall, some astronomers who occupy the neighboring Pupin Physics Laboratory said the layout of the new building has blocked out one-ninth of the night sky from the telescopes in the Rutherford Observatory. ""It's a shame,"" David Hirsh, the University's executive vice president for research, said in January. ""This is something that has been a problem all along, and we just have to face this problem."" The telescopes are used for both teaching and research, and some who use them have added that the light from the new building will prevent clear observation. NEW MEDIA FOR THE TIMES Columbia's Journalism School has also seen an expansion this year in an effort to boost research on new forms of media. In January, the J-School completed the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, and in April, it added a dual degree program in conjunction with SEAS for students interested in digital journalism. ""We've been moving in a digital direction very rapidly these past few years, and we'd like to keep moving and be a recognized leader in teaching digital journalism to students,"" Nicholas Lemann, dean of the Journalism School, said in January. In 2008, the Tow Foundation gave a $5 million gift to the J-School to found the digital media center, with the stipulation that Columbia raise an additional $lO million in two years. After the fundraising was completed this year, searches for a director began, and in April the position was given to Emily Bell, who plans to leave her post at The Guardian and start this summer. In April, the University Senate passed a proposal to implement a ""Dual Master of Science Degree in Journalism and Computer Science"" between the J-School and SEAS, and the University hopes to launch it in fall 2011. The program is slated to have a specialized digital journalism curriculum. ""This was not a hard sale among our faculty or the faculty in the Senate,"" said Bill Grueskin, dean of academic affairs for the Journalism School, referring to the pressing need for a program like this amid the changing atmosphere of journalism. Shehrbano Saiyid, Journalism 'lO and specializing in broadcast, said in April that the J-School's focus is in flux. ""Old forms of journalism are going out,"" she said. ""The Journalism School is trying to make the students realize that it's a part of our success to better know the Internet and digital media."" NAME CHANGES, NEW MAJORS, AND NEW APPLICATIONS Columbia's Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures department (MEALAC) capped off what chair Sudipta Kaviraj said has been gradual curricular changes with a new moniker—Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies (MESAAS). The department has expanded to include South Asian and African courses, Kaviraj said, and has shifted from a focus on languages, cultures, and literacy studies to study of the history and social sciences of these regions. In March, the Earth Institute, CC, and the School of General Studies announced that they will offer a major in sustainable development to undergraduates. Students already had the option of concentrating in sustainable development, and the high level of interest in the concentration spurred the University to develop a full major, according to the Earth Institute's website. Also in March, administrators for the creative writing program offered through the School of the Arts for CC undergraduates announced that, as of fall 2010, the program will require an application, which will include a substantial writing sample. amber.tunnell @columbiaspectator.com"
156,Art Humanities,From Schools to Screens can online education revive the liberal arts?,16 September 2010,"can online education revive the liberal arts?by Ian SchefflerILLUSTRATION BY MATTEO MALINVERNOImagine you are an English major, newly declared. We're happy for you, your parents say, but how will you find a job? Though some might argue that practicality is hardly a cornerstone of a liberal arts education, the rising cost of college makes it an important consideration. Since the 19705, the average price of four years at a private school has outpaced inflation by 440 percent. If current trends continue, that amount of schooling will run over half a million dollars by the late 20205, and three quarters of a million dollars by the mid 20305. Though studying the humanities preserves our cultural heritage, majors like classics and medieval studies are quickly losing ground to degrees in law and finance. The trend away from the studying of the archaic past to the more relevant issues of the present is one that could have serious implications for public policy—if fewer students study the thinkers of the past, who will be qualified to evaluate the problems of the future? One possibility is to make the humanities more attractive. Closing the link between old perspectives and current events could make liberal arts degrees more practical (and perhaps marketable) by bringing considerations of application into the classroom, a place they have not inhabited since Immanuel Kant's 1798 plan for the modern university divided the pursuit of knowledge from its practice. As Mark Taylor, chair of Columbia's religion department, notes in his latest book, Crisis on Campus, texts from the past have a great deal to teach us about the present. ""When I write books on theories of complex adaptive systems,"" he says, ""that's the writing of Hegel ... What I try to get students to see is the way in which these thinkers illuminate the condition in which we find ourselves."" Of course, finding a teacher capable of connecting the past and present in meaningful ways is difficult. Understanding the context of a work of art or literature that takes place in a different time and country can require outside information that is often difficult to come by without travelling. How completely can art history students, for instance, grasp the relationship between the Parthenon and its surroundings without visiting Athens? While photographs and books provide some degree of experience, neither is a perfect substitute for visiting. As Taylor points out, however, the internet is a viable alternative to travel. With tools like video, photography, audio, text and videoconferencing, all of which can be linked together, a platform exists that can pluck information from its resting place and deposit it at the user's fingertips. Though electronic media cannot per-fectly recreate objects from the past or distant locations in the present, the new array of tools can passably imitate—and in some ways enhance—traditional modes of learning. As Columbia students know, panoramas of the Parthenon on the Art Humanities website provide better representations of the building than do slides on a projector. In addition, online education has the potential to drive down the cost of a university education. Since online courses can be taken anywhere, they eliminate the need to travel and live on a school's physical campus. Moreover, courses designed for online consumption require less upkeep than traditional classes. While seminars will always require copious personal interaction, lectures could reuse portions of their structure and format from year to year, making their initial creation a single expense that could be divided over their lifetime. The combined reductions in university and student expenditures could substantially reduce the price tag of a school like Columbia.Naturally, trepidations about the use of new media as a replacement for classroom teaching exist. As Frank Moretti, the executive director of Columbia's Center for New Media Teaching and Learning, pointed out in an interview, the difference between going to college and learning online is like the difference between living in a community and reading about one. ""Even though the way that I make my living is promoting the purposeful use of digital technologies and new media,"" he says, ""I'm not quick to dismiss what it is we've been doing for decades and centuries, which really does involve the contention of individuals with one another in social contexts."" Those social contexts are complex—as Morettinoted, the history of Western education is predicated on small, interpersonal discussions, dating back to Plato's Academy in Athens. The goal of those discussions is to promote dialogue between a student's interior and exterior landscapes, a dynamic that relies on the quality, not the quantity of information. If education shifts from the classroom to the chat room, would the serendipitous interaction between students and faculty—the office hours and hallway chats—that allows academic communities to thrive still exist? Online courses permit students to learn on their own time, but education, Moretti explains, ""is more than the communication of information."" In addition to concerns over diminished social contact on the internet, there are a number of legal issues that could arise if educational material goes online. As Blake Allmendinger, a professor of English at UCLA, said in an email, it could be unclear who owns online lectures. ""As far as I know,"" he says, ""the issue has never been litigated in the courts, so I'm not clear as to who owns my lectures. It's different with books. If I write a book, it's copyrighted in my name and so it's my property, not UCLA's. But my lectures aren't copyrighted. Would they be if they were online? I don't know."" ""In theory,"" he continues, ""my lectures are my own intellectual property, my ideas, my interpretations of literature. But if they're made available online, anyone can have them, potentially even students who aren't in the course."" As Allmendinger states, anything online can be easily duplicated and transmitted. In the future, schools could find themselves struggling against illegal downloads that cut into their income. Like record companies today, colleges and universities could run into serious difficulties once their products are competing with free facsimiles. How many file-sharing websites would fill up with lectures and course materials if elite schools posted them online? Furthermore, there is the question of certification. Degrees from schools like Columbia and UCLA mean a great deal on the desks of future employers. Would a recruiter examining two students from comparable schools devalue the student who had taken a portion of his courses online and rate higher the student who could pay for four years on campus? These are all critical issues, and Taylor takes them seriously. As he acknowledges in Crisis, ""These [technological] developments do not offer a panacea for higher education and it remains important to preserve what is valuable to the policies and practices of the past."" That said, his book offers several compelling reasons to incorporate new media into higher education. While Taylor admits that no online school can provide the same environment as a traditional college, his personal experience suggests thatstrong bonds can be formed between students and professors who interact online. In 1992, while at Williams College, Taylor and Esa Saarinen, of the University of Helsinki, used teleconferencing to bring 10 students from each school together for a weekly seminar on media philosophy. By the end of the semester, several students had formed close relationships, and on the final day of class, the Finns announced they would visit Williams after the winter holidays. Though Taylor acknowledges that teleconferencing is an imperfect substitute for personal contact, he and Saarinen were surprised to find that it effectively imitated classroom debate. In Taylor's words, ""In a very, very short time, you forget those people [on the computer screen] are not in your room. It's like having them right there.""In addition to creating vibrant relationships, Taylor's course deepened his students' understandings of the world. In a discussion of cultural critic Jean Baudrillard's America, the Finns and Americans disagreed about the natures of their respective countries. While the Finns accepted Baudrillard's critique of America as crass and unintelligent, the Americans dissented and shot back that Europe had passed its prime and entered a period of decrepitude.Instead of simply absorbing information about European beliefs, Taylor's students were forced to re-examine their own culture through an outsider's lens—precisely the sort of introspection that Moretti considers integral to a liberal arts education. Rather than end a tradition of stimulating conversation, Taylor's course brought students from different countries together to enhance it. While Taylor's experience with online learning may be a workable exception to typical ecollege, the legal issues that Allmendinger pointed out are still an open question. As he noted, it has yet to be decided who would earn money from downloading educational material. Would professors receive royalties from their lectures? Would they have the right to choose how their courses were distributed? Could they refuse to make their content available? Conflict between administration and faculty over the pricing and delivery of e-college seems inevitable if the future is as full of cash-strapped endowments and underpaid adjuncts as Taylor predicts. In regards to theft —another issue Allmendinger raised—it is impossible to guarantee that educational materials will remain safe online. If Ivy League schools made it possible to earn a degree on the Internet, the demand for stolen diplomas could be significant, considering their worldwide reputation and the weight they carry on the job market. The question of certification is likewise unresolved. Taylor imagines sidestepping discrimination between physical and online degrees by graduating students based on the depth of their knowledge instead of their total of credits. While such a program would honor the changing nature of writing and reading in the 21st century, allowing students more latitude in the design of. their education than ever before, it is an approach perhaps better suited for performance programs like music and dance.

157,Art Humanities,Neiman exhibit travels worn path to 'House' of past,14 October 2010,"BY KAVITHA SURANA Columbia Daily SpectatorWalking into the Leßoy Neiman Gallery this October might feel like a step back in time to an early '6os pop surrealist showcase. The exhibition—titled ""Fool's House"" and curated by Nora Griffin, MFA 'll—combines tongue-in-cheek conceptual humor with a touch of ready-made workmanship. The inspiration for the exhibition is a Jasper Johns painting (also called ""Fool's House"") that depicts the artist's objects (specifically a broom, a stretcher, a towel, and a cup), as if they were actually attached to the canvas. Johns irreverently scribbles the titles of each object with an arrow pointing toward it and incorporates the text ""Fool's House"" partially into the composition. The exhibition tries to use Johns' energetic and slightly devious painting as a taking-off point for, in the words of Griffin, ""an endless conversation."" Jim Lee's works, such as ""Upper Grove"" and ""Diagonal Pull,"" seem to tend toward the more abstract expressionist side of Johns' contemporaries, playing with interactions of wide swaths of color, shapes, and mixed media. And while ""Untitled (A Dark Composition Drawing)""—a simple black piece of paper with white rectangles—is not particularly visually stimulating, ""Untitled (A Thousand Evils)""—a bright blue oval with a stripe of silver aluminum dotted with jagged pencil holes—makes up for it with an intriguing title and unique composition, almost appearing as a face with bullet holes. Peter Gallo's art emphasizes working with text and challenges the viewer with witty word games that engage the mind. For example, what should one make of two interconnecting circles, one labeled ""philosophizing,"" and the other ""crying""? Is the artist trying to say that the two lead to each another? Is philosophizing a form of crying? Is he simply putting up random words to confuse viewers? Similarly, the painting ""Cannot Explain Simple Daily Occurrences"" reworks the originally straightforward sentence to mess with the mind. The words ""Occurrence,"" ""Daily,"" ""Simple,"" and ""Explain"" appear in a square, with ""Cannot"" excluded from the square and placed underneath. Lower on the canvas, two half-full ovals that vaguely resemble squinting eyes make the painting all the more humorous and entertaining. Becky Brown's works take a cue from readymades. ""Spine"" consists of a thin line of the bindings of books. Distressed and splashed with paint, the piece might be an interesting take on the effects of the digital age on books. Perhaps books are destined to become representational objects on their own: objects like Johns' broom, givena new kind of value through artwork. Brown's intriguing floor pieces also use a ready-made approach, incorporating objects like books and bricks covered in rivulets of paint. Josephine Halvorson's ""Seam, Peel"" tries to convince us that an oil painting is a wood fence with peeling paint, mirroring Johns' attempt to paint the objects in his painting as if they actually exist attached to the canvas. ""Fool's House"" does not really offer lots of new material or concepts; rather, it recycles old themes from Jasper Johns' heyday. It is reminiscent of an amateurish version of a JohnsDuchamp, Neo-Dada collaboration. Furtherplaying with the concept of the title, the exhibition is itself a ""house,"" fooling its visitors with imitations and mimicry that seem roughly close to the real thing. The energy of the pieces almost lulls one into a false sense of witnessing the cutting-edge of a movement that surfaced over 60 years ago. It's a treat for students familiar with Art Humanities to see contemporary artists building upon a past repertoire right on campus. While a trip to the Museum of Modern Art is always rewarding, for the rest of October students can pop into the Leßoy Neiman Gallery afterward for a seeming continuation.WON'T BE 'FOOLED' AGAIN I The latest Leßoy Neiman Gallery exhibit, ""Fool's House,"" curated by Nora Griffin, MFA 'll, revisits the aesthetic thought of Jasper Johns and 1960s pop surrealists."
158,Art Humanities,Lit Hum expands online programs,9 November 2010,"BY RAKHI AGRAWAL Columbia Daily SpectatorThe recently revamped Literature Humanities website is about to showcase a lot more undergraduate work. Lit Hum plans to launch a ""Core Scholars"" program, according to Christia Mercer, chair of Lit Hum and philosophy professor. As part of this program, students will be able to submit Core-themed essays, which expand on central themes within the Core, such as beauty, family, or suffering; ""Core connection"" essays, which explore how two parts of the Core connect; or ""contemporary reflections"" essays, which compare a part of the Core to contemporary events. ""One of the goals is just to get the students thinking about core issues outside of the courses they are taking,"" Mercer said. ""Another goal is to get students to think about the connections among the parts of the core."" ""For example, you may write a core connection essay about war in Goya's paintings that you are studying in Art Humanities, and let's say, the 'The Iliad,' which you study in Literature Humanities, and that's pretty awesome,"" she added. The new addition is part of the overhaul of the website, which will now include resources such as sample midterm exams, additional readings, and background information on the texts for both instructors and students. Joey Shemuel, CC 'll and former Spectator deputy photo editor, thinks Core Scholars will ultimately benefit students. ""It's another way [for students] to be involved with the administration in a more academic capacity,"" Shemuel said, adding that there is also ""a lot of potential for cross-Core scholarship or interaction."" The project also hopes to secure funding to publish the essays in print, Mercer said. Shemuel added that the articles would most likely be published in a journal format similar to the Blue and White. ""For students that may want to work on a journal, it's good preparation,"" he said. The primary incentives for students to submit, Mercer said,would be to obtain peer recognition and a line item on their resumes. Still, some students said they don't feel these are good enough incentives to contribute essays. ""Because there aren't any concrete incentives for students to contribute to it, I don't think the quality of their contributions will be very strong,"" Rui Yu, CC 'l4, said. Noelle Van Rysselberghe, CC 'l3, feels that time would be an issue for many. ""I would definitely, like, check it out and read what's up there, but I don't feel like I would have time to write an essay that's not for a class,"" Rysselberghe said. Despite the support from professors the site has gotten so far, publicity for the site and the program continues to he a struggle, Mercer noted. In upcoming weeks, students.can expect to receive emails soliciting essays, see flyers posted around campus asking, ""Do you want to be a Core Scholar?"" and more mentions of the program inCore classes, she said. Current essays on the website are those written by professors, but she hopes that they will eventually only be the work of students. Still, Mercer fears that students may take advantage of the expanded site and plagiarize from the new material. ""Given that they [the essays] are all online and all of the instructors can see them there, it would be pretty stupid to borrow heavily from them,""she said, adding that plans are in place to set up a way for checking for plagiarism that would originate from the site. Since Oct. 16, the average daily hits to the site is 165, 16 percent of which are logged-in students, and 12 percent come from logged-in instructors, Mercer said. She hopes that the launching of the Core Scholars project will cause these numbers to rise. ""Our thinking is that if you give students good examples of good papers they can be inspired,"" she said. news@columbiaspectator.com"
159,Art Humanities,Conceptualize This Columbia's lit hum chair tracks the history of individual ideas,9 December 2010,"Columbia's lit hum chair tracks the history of individual ideasby Cathi ChoiILLUSTRATION BY DEVIN BRISKIWe've all picked it up from Literature Humanities: Montaigne is the master of skeptically reconsidering and questioning reality. To think about Montaigne just in the context of Lit Hum, however, is too limiting for Christia Mercer, current Lit Hum chair and philosophy professor. Montaigne's role, she says, extends into the Art Humanities classroom. Though Montaigne and an artist like Pieter Bruegel may have had no real influence on each other, Mercer says, their works complement each other. ""Bruegel's conception of space and reality is so much related to Montaigne,"" Mercer says. ""It's fascinating that they were both approaching the reconsideration of reality at roughly the same time, in very much the same way—just one is philosophical, and the other, you know, is artistic. And that is really amazing."" It's connections like these that have motivated Mercer to begin a book series, Oxford Philosophical Concepts , written and edited by experts in various disciplines. Each book in the series focuses on a specific idea, such as eternity, evil, authenticity, or time, incorporating viewpoints from multiple fields.For Mercer, these ideas and concepts not only transcend academic boundaries, but also have been reformulated with different consequences depending on the time period. Sympathy, for instance, began as a metaphysical notion, and then, with Adam Smith, it turned into something more moral and economic. The history of ""sympathy"" over multiple time periods would be just one of the concepts tracked in the OPC series. This is an unusual approach in that most histories of philosophy span only one period, according to Peter Ohlin, Oxford University Press editor and the publisher of the series. ""I asked her,"" Ohlin says, ""to do a handbook of early modern philosophy—a large collection of essays. She was in my office and she said the world doesn't need that—there are so many other books that serve that function."" ""What, then, does the world need?"" he asked. Mercer mulled it over and realized that shewanted to introduce people to philosophical discussions by including how ""philosophical concepts"" have been discussed outside of philosophy and the historical contexts they have evolved from. We talk a lot about whether something is ""authentic"" or not, but that concept didn't exist before the 16th century, according to Mercer, who goes on to ask, ""Now that's interesting—so what was it about the 16th century that generated the problem that authenticity was supposed to solve?"" Gottfried Leibniz's philosophy of peace, for instance, makes more sense when one understands the historical context. Around the time Leibniz was born, the Thirty Years' War had just ended, which had killed off a third of Germany's population. How to deal with war and conflict is still a relevant issue today, but new problems, such as the question of pluralism and rights, have occupied our agenda as well. ""Human beings go through life and face certain problems and philosophers try to think about the problems and solve them. These concepts are all attempts on the part of philosophers to solve the problem. The problems have changed radically—you know, Machiavelli didn't care about rights,"" Mercer notes.In short, the series ""is an attempt to get people to get the intuition behind the concept, and how that's changed over time,"" Mercer says. The Oxford Philosophical Concepts series is meant to target a larger audience than most top philosophical journals, whose technical natures assume audiences have some familiarity with philosophy. If you are ""a smart person in history or art history or music,"" or in short, just an undergrad, you should be able to pick up a journal and understand it. But even for those who are equipped with graduate degrees and academic expertise, this series will find an audience in experts who want to know how their areas of study overlap with the ideas of the volume. ""We [academics] are all engaged in research, but we don't talk about it to each other very much,"" Pamela Smith, one of the interdisciplinary advisors of the series, says. Part of the OPC project includes workshops thatprovide the space for interdisciplinary dialogue, such as one which Smith attended recently on the concept of consciousness. It involved three to four presentations and a round-table discussion that explored the intersection of each person's research and interest. The idea behind the OPC can be traced back to Mercer's intellectual journey. She had initially pursued art history, but after a while realized her real interest lied in the realm of philosophy. ""What 1 was really interested in was thinking about why Renaissance painters think about space and reality,"" she says. The series, although not officially published yet, has already been met with both fervor and apprehension. Its innovative nature, Mercer says, could scare some historians of philosophy. ""The main idea is to be intellectually stimulating and to not really respect traditional boundaries in telling the story of an idea—in a sense, it's a little bit of a risk because there's no established market,"" Ohlin says. ""But I'm hoping that the creativity and the innovative quality of the books will find an audience."" ® Sarah Ngu contributed to this article.""THE MAIN IDEA IS TO BE INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING AND TO NOT REALLY RESPECT TRADITIONAL BOUNDARIES IN TELLING THE STORY OF AN IDEA."""

161,Art Humanities,Admins hope to endow Core Campaign still in early planning stages,10 February 2012,"Campaign still in early planning stagesBY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterSenior administrators are planning to establish an endowment for the Core Curriculum to help ensure its long-term sustainability. Alumni, faculty members, and administrators have been discussing ideas for a broadbased fundraising initiative since the fall. University President Lee Bollinger said that the plan for the endowment is still being pieced together, but that by the end of the semester it should be ""pretty well shaped-up."" ""I think that there will be a lot of people who will find this appealing to support,"" he said. ""We're bringing the college, the faculty, and the curriculum much closer together, so that's kind of the goal. The more that happens, the more people will want to give-both for what they've been giving and more broadly."" As Columbia's capital campaign has surged past its initial goal of $4 billion and toward its new goal of $5 billion, Bollinger said he is hopeful that a ""sub-campaign"" could be established in support ofundergraduate education. ""I think that there is no question that we will have a campaign to get a greater endowment for the Core,"" he said. ""And I think we will expand that and include it as part of a campaign for all undergraduate teaching and faculty departments as well."" Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks said that the Core endowment would be a ""wonderful opportunity"" to solidify support for the curriculum, especially considering the unique logistical demands of the Core and the outsize share of Columbia College students' educations that it takes up. ""We're always interested in finding greater levels of support for the Core because it's a very time-intensive mode of education,"" he said. ""We're all keen to find ways to support what is an extraordinarily complicated and difficult curriculum to mount."" The Core requires the staffing of many small sections each year, making it an expensive program. Finding enough professors and graduate students to teach every semester can be a challenge, and some have said there should be more financial incentives for tenured and ten-ure-track faculty to teach Core classes. Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini is one of several administrators who have been involved in discussions about a Core endowment. He said that although no decisions have been made about how an endowment would be allocated, some of it could go toward incentivizing senior faculty members to teach courses like LiteratureHumanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""Endow means enhance, in this case,"" Valentini said. ""If something is important to you, you want to establish a base of funding that guarantees its existence in perpetuity.""Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis added that, ""since the Core is the intellectual and curricular signature of the College, one of the first issues we will want to address is the normative one ... what should be the percentage of tenure and ten-ure-track faculty teaching in the Core."" Valentini explained that he is working with other administrators to develop a detailed plan for a Core endowment that would outline its goals and explore ways of achieving them. He has also spent time talking to alumni about what a Core endowment would look like. ""Endowing the Core is both establishing money for it and also getting money to make it better,"" he said. ""If something is a priority to you, you find a special line of funding for it.""Dirks agreed that it is important to encourage senior faculty to participate in the Core. ""We want to make sure that we get more and more senior faculty teaching in the Core,"" Dirks said. ""It also makes clear the commitment of the institution as a whole to the importance of the Core."" Dirks, who is teaching a section of Contemporary Civilization for the first time this semester, also expressed interest in establishing more support for Art Humanities and Music Humanities. ""I would like very much to include them, eventually in the ideas of endowing the Core,"" he said.

163,Art Humanities,The core of Global Core,7 March 2012,"To consider the role of nonWestern scholarship and thought in the Core Curriculum, it is necessary to reemphasize why the Core exists in the first place. From a historical perspective, the Core came about in response to World War I, with the goal of educating the country's youth in a way that would help prevent war in the future. This initial catalyst began to form what would eventually become a full curriculum that gives its students a complete understanding of the origins and history of the West. Through the study of literature, philosophy, music, and art, the creators of the Core thought that students graduating from Columbia would fundamentally understand their society and civilization. The Core Curriculum has expanded beyond its original intentions. For a campus that often lacks community, the courses that we all take in common are building blocks of a common Columbia identity among undergraduates. As ivory-tower as it sounds, our common exposure to the ""Iliad"" creates an interconnectedness that we would not have otherwise. The lack of a disciplinary focus in these Core classes also has come to define their appeal. As any Columbia College student knows, classes like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization do not approach the course material with a particular departmental lens. Whether a biology or philosophy major, a student can feel free to engage with texts from his or her point of view and background. Because of the accessibility of these courses, they have much more to give to the students who take them. The final added benefit to the Core Curriculum system is that degree to which knowledge is prescribed for the students. By having such a rigid set of classes that span such a large period of time, the College can ensure that each of its students has been exposed to what experienced educators and academicians have agTeed is important. If they are to be believed, then the Core Curriculum gives every student the necessary groundwork to understand the world. The Global Core, in its effort to represent theimportant role of non-Western civilizations, lacks all three of these benefits. As it stands now, there is a list of about 100 courses from which students choose two to fulfill the requirement The courses are almost all in specific departments. Because of this disparity, there is no wide body of knowledge to which all students are exposed. Instead, the Global Core serves only to force students to take a course that is not particularly related to Western civilization. While that is a good goal, and we are all better educated because of it, the non-Western aspect of the Core could be much more robust The solution, I believe, is in establishing the Global Core as a single, year-long class for all students. While similar to Lit Hum and CC in format, it would combine literature and philosophy and span a much greater geography. Its goal would be analogous to the Core itself: to expose students to just enough foundational knowledge to be able to understand the world and potentially build upon it in their personal educational pursuits. Additionally, it would build Columbia's community through common education and introduce students to non-Western concepts without the limitations of a department or discipline guiding the discussion. Condensing the Global Core into a single course will certainly draw some immediate criticism. Part of the reason it remains such a wide-ranging requirement is that the non-Western parts of the world are numerous and impossible to distill. To limit the requirement to one specific course would rob students of the Global Core's topical specificity. However, such an argument is tenuous, given that it could also apply to existing Core classes. Is a semester of Art Humanities really enough to get a sense of thousands of years of art? Is a year of Lit Hum even enough to do all of Western literature justice? The point has never been to be comprehensiveit has been to give a taste. Then, if students were intrigued, they could spend some of their academic time studying those subjects. The current Global Core makes the mistake of choosing to be comprehensive in one small area instead of being broad in its exposure. While the battle for a required non-Western curriculum would be bitter, its resolution would place yet another jewel in the crown of a Columbia education.

164,Art Humanities,Former NYPL pres. to direct Paris global center,23 April 2012,"BY MELISSA VON MAYRHAUSER Spectator Senior Staff WriterColumbia's global center in Paris is expanding its academic offerings, forging ties with campus cultural houses, and will soon have its first permanent director. University President Lee Bollinger announced on Thursday that French literature scholar and former New York City Public Library president Paul LeClerc, GSAS '69, will direct the center starting in July. He will replace interim director Victoria de Grazia, who has led the center since it opened in 2010. ""The fact that he [LeClerc] wants to become the director of our European center is a very strong signal of how seriously people are now taking our centers,"" Vice President of Global Centers Ken Prewitt said. LeClerc told Spectator that hewants to expand the center's regional scope, so that students have the chance to reflect on contemporary European issues—such as the debt crisis, demographic shifts, and energy policy—with policy-makers. ""What I would like to think about is how we offer Columbia students a kind of privileged level of access to European thinkers that would be unique to this program,"" LeClerc said. LeClerc said that he would like to develop other new programs by fostering a close relationship between the global center and Columbia's cultural houses. He currently chairs the advisory board of Maison Fran§aise, Columbia's French cultural house. Columbia's other European cultural houses are Casa Italiana, Casa Hispanica, and Deutsches Haus. LeClerc expressed interest in creating closer relationships with those cultural houses as well.""If the German program is going to be collaborating with us to do things, I hope, in Paris, why don't we start doing things together here in New York between the language houses?"" LeClerc said. Shanny Peer, the director of Maison Franfaise, hopes to forge ties between the Maison and the global center in Paris. They might increase awareness about their research projects and conferences through the use of technology. ""That [relationship] could take different shapes,"" Peer said. ""That could be organizing a series of conferences or talks that take place here and there. That could be a conference here that's Skyped to Paris, and vice versa."" LeClerc, who was a pioneer of the digital library during his tenure as NYPL president, plans to expand the global center's digital offerings.""I want us to have a huge Web presence with as much of what we do there on the Web for people to see,"" he said. ""Lectures, conferences, all those kinds of things—ideally even someday courses."" But while the global center in Paris becomes more Eurocentric, Columbia students and faculty continue to show a fascination with Francophone studies. More Columbia students did study abroad programs in France than in any other country in 20102011, and the fascination is mutual—224 French scholars studied at Columbia last year, more than from any other European country. The large number of French students at Columbia is partially due to the Alliance Program, an agreement between Columbia and three French universities—the Ecole Polytechnique, Sciences Po, and the Universite of Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne—to encourage scholarly exchange. And with Columbia students increasingly choosing to study in France, a faculty committee is pursuing the idea of offering Core Curriculum classes at the Parisglobal center that would connect to French culture and politics. ""The project that is most advanced at this point is in Paris,"" Dean of Humanities Pierre Force said, referring to a project to bring the Core Curriculum to the global centers. He noted that Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and African Civilization are three courses that professors might teach in Paris. ""We think that offering Art Humanities in Paris would provide us with many possibilities to take advantage of the local resources, such as the local museums in Paris and trips to places in Paris to see art,"" Force said. Faculty members are also developing courses for the global center in Paris that relate to French and Francophone culture and history. They might start developing programs that address Francophone scholarly interests in West Africa, and the global centers office plans to open a global center in West Africa as well. ""Right now we are expecting to do some West African planning with the global center in Paris, partly because Paris and the French in general have very strong ties with West Africa,""Prewitt said. ""Then it may be easier to do it with France as our base of operations, at least until we can open an office there."" But even as Columbia looks to strengthen its academic relationship with France through the global center and cultural house, that relationship is steeped in history—nearly 100 years' worth, in fact. La Maison Franchise was founded in 1913, and it was ""the first French academic and cultural center of its kind on an American campus,"" Peer said. The cultural house was part of former University President Nicholas Murray Butler's vision to make the campus more international a century ago. Butler also created Columbia's first visiting professorships with France in 1912, according to Peer. By opening global centers, Columbia is in some ways continuing Butler's tradition of international education. ""I think there's an orientation difference between globalization and an international focus,"" Peer said. ""But still, it's a continuous line of openness to other countries."" melissa.vonmayrhauser @columbiaspectator.com"

Mellon Foundation. Ursinus, a liberal arts college in a Philadelphia suburb with an enrollment of about 1,700 students, created its main core course in 2002, more than 80 years after Columbia instructors taught the first Contemporary Civilization classes. Now, the two schools will collaborate, with the Mellon Foundation grant funding visits from Ursinus professors and students to Columbia, and vice versa. Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said in an email that Ursinus used ""the Columbia College model"" to develop its main core course, a yearlong class called the Common Intellectual Experience. The CIE syllabus includes a combination of texts that are taught in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""We are extremely pleased with this opportunity to formalize those earlier links by sharing institutional knowledge about the challenges and opportunities of running a successful Core program,"" Yatrakis said. While Ursinus doesn'tmandate any other classes for all students, like Art Humanities and Music Humanities at Columbia, it requires that students fulfill distribution requirements across disciplines ranging from music to mathematics, in addition to completing the CIE.The Mellon Foundation funding will support ""visits from Columbia scholars whose expertise pertains to works in the CIE syllabus,"" as well as visits to Columbia from Ursinus Junior Fellows and select first-year students, according to an Ursinus statement. Additionally, an Ursinus professor will teach a Core class at Columbia. Roosevelt Montas, the director of Columbia's Center for the Core Curriculum, said that the partnership would help Ursinus troubleshoot as it continues to develop its core, and that Columbia graduate students would be able to takesummer workshops at Ursinus that would introduce them to a ""liberal arts pedagogy."" ""The main benefit to Columbia from this collaboration comes in the opportunities it will create for our graduate students to learn about teaching in a liberal arts college,"" Montas said, adding that some of the grant money will be used to create post-doc-toral positions for Columbia doctoral students who teach in the Core. The Mellon Foundation funding will also fund the establishment of post-doctoralfellows at Ursinus, as well as the creation of the MellonCIE Junior Fellows program, which is being modeled after Columbia's Core Scholars program.

I started watching the online talks in high school, eager to ﬁll my free time with random pieces of wisdom from the World’s most inspired thinkers. When I arrived at Columbia, I happened upon the opportunity to begin a TEDx conference——a localized, independently organized TED—so I automatically jumped at the chance. But as I started t_o plan, a question gnawed at me: As a student at a university with hundreds of incredible classes per day, of which I can choose any I want, why do_l need TEDxColumbiaCollege? ‘ . The answer goes much deeper than just a TEDX conference. I found that sometimes I needed not choose some learning opportunities. Rather, I needed to stumble upon them in order to bring new ideas and greater perspective to those I did choose. TED offers a clearinghouse of knowledge-—you never know exactly what you’re going to gegt-:’i‘lf-‘ls’-‘uniqu_ge because,"",for_ a feW‘jhgs,u-rs,‘you""li‘sten' to a wide array of ide‘as?that""3‘iour fdon’_t have tojchoose.

Columbia does a great job encouraging this through the Core Curriculum. The computer science major is askedwell, forced—to take a chance on Art Humanities and the art history student on Frontiers of Science. The Core forces us to explore beyond those disciplines that we already know We’re interested in. TEDxColumbiaCollege showed me the importance of this type of exploration outside ofclass.

Steve Jobs, in his now-famous Stanford commencement speech, mentioned the necessity of serendipitous learning.

167,Art Humanities,A wealth of economics education,15 February 2013,"BY JOSHUA FATTAL ' Adam Smith has left me wanting. Reading excerpts from the famous “Wealth of Nations” for Contemporary Civilization, I am overtaken with an appreciation for the complexity of the formation of the modern political economy. And yet, I remain without an understanding of how that economy actually works. Economics will be a daily part of my life no matter what career I embark on; itis a daily part of all of our lives. Whereis the Core requirement preparing every Columbia student for this reality? We are required to learn literature, philosophy, science, history, language, art, and music—but not economics. A subject this fundamental and this necessary must be added to the Core Curriculum if the Core is to remain true to its founding objectives. The Core was not always so detached from this field. In 1928, Contemporary Civilization was divided into two courses, CC-A_ and CC-B. CC-A is what we think of as CC now, but CC—B emphasized “the question of making a living in the United States.” In 1932, the onset of the Great Depression made it_ necessary for CC-B to include questions about the “nation’s economic security and survival.” But by 1961, CC-B was placed on hold as a requirement because both students and teachers struggled to adequately understand subjects that ranged from economics to sociology to psychology without any prior foundation. “They could not, for example, properly understand what Keynes, was saying without the foundation of a previous course in economic theory,” Dean Carl Hovde wrotein 1961. By 1968, because it had for so long struggled to define its aims and received affection from neither instructors nor students, CC-B was dropped. CC-B evidently had its flaws. But instead of dropping the course entirely, the college should have dropped its challengingly broad nature and focused the course solely on modern economic theory and practice. Hovde wasright to recognize that an uninitiated student cannot properly understand Keynesbut this does not mean that Keynes is not important enough to warrant understanding. It is remarkable that the college has not found economics to be part of “the necessary general education for students”—the Core’s founding mission. ' In today’s college, a student who is llot an CCOII l”l’la]OI' IS Il€V€l' I'€qllll'€d to learn the basics of economics. Economics will be a part of a_ student’s life no matter whatfield he or she decides to enter.lt will be as important as CC for understanding the foundations A of today’s society. It .will be as necessary as Music and Art Humanities are for dinner party conversation. And on top of this, an understanding of economics will be useful both theoretically and practically. The best the Core could do is enable students to both appreciate the theoretical brilliance in'the clouds and implement that brilliance practically in the world ,down below. T _ ; i In today’s college, astudent who is not an econ ,; major is never required to learn the basics of econom— T ics. One can opt to take Principles of Economics, a j , class as quantitative as it is qualitative, but he or she Vwill still not gain a working understanding of today’s 1 economy, More concrete and practical classes, such : as The American Economy, are only available for stu- f dents who -have taken the necessary prerequisites. ’ The college should offer a mandatory one-semes- ; ter course that begins with the theoretical development of modern economics, tackles the American economy, and takes a look at the global economy as a whole. Such a.class should be quantitative enough to enable students to understand -the inner workings of what theyjare learning, but qualitative enough so that students can truly comprehend how the economy functions and make use of this knowledge in today’s world. There are many qualifiedprofessors to teach this—and the subject has perhaps never been as important for young adults to grasp as now. I say all this as a history major, in search of an educationthat will stimulate my mind in both tangible ‘ and intangible ways. There is currently a gaping hole in the Core Curriculum, and an educational institution committed to teaching all its students the necessary knowledge for global citizenship cannot afford to remain blinded to one of the most important subjects. Just ask Adam Smith. The author is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in history."
168,Art Humanities,Grant will fund more courses abroad,1 May 2013,"BY SAMANTHA COONEY ‘’ AND'CECILIAiI€EYE'S' I ’ i Spectator‘Senior Staff Writers In 2014, undergraduates who study abroad will have even more courses to choose from as Columbia continues to embrace a global mind-set. With the support of a $2.1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, administrators and faculty are embarking on a project to design and approve courses that will be offered exclusively abroad. = Nine departments have submitted 10 proposals for courses. Interim Executive Vice President ' for Arts and Sciences David Madigan, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Carlos Alonso, and Columbia College Dean James Valentini will review them with regard to instruction and budgetary possibilities. The Committee on Instruction will then have to apI prove them. » _ “Some of them are the same types that are currently taught in New York that will be modiﬁed somewhat to be taught in a location abroad,” Jack Snyder, chair of the subcommittee of global education in the Educational Policy and Planning Committee, said. “Some of them are brand , new courses that are designed speciﬁcally around the location abroad where they will be taught, dealing with the culture or his- ' tory of that area.” Faculty are still discussing the possibility of using the grant 'to offer Music. Humanities, Art Humanities, and Global Core classes. abroad, a change l-that University President Lee ' ' Bollinger has expressed a strong interest in seeing. Some courses will only be offered during the summer. In the fall of 2012, the EPPC appointed Snyder, a profes- ' sor of international relations at the School of Internationaland Public Affairs, to chair the subcommittee. He ledia survey of academic departments to evaluate how well global programs were serving their students. “We also surveyed undergraduate students, too, just_ to ﬁnd out what their plans were, what their concerns were, what their hopes were for opportunities,” he said. The survey results showed that undergraduatesmost Want to learn about a particular region’s culture, expand their O knowledge of foreign languages, and participate in summer internships or programs abroad with more ﬂexible schedules. When the committee learned that Columbia had been awarded the Mellon grant, Snyder said that “there was a question of how to turn the general language of the grant into a speciﬁc plan.” The project is estimated to last for the next six and a half years, and the Mellon Foundation has pledged another $2 million in ""support of the project after the ﬁrst three and a half years. i Four additional faculty members across all relevant departments will be appointed over the ﬁrst year. Snyder said new hireswould most likely replace senior faculty who choose to teach abroad, noting that the proposals “are designed to let current faculty members go abroad.” The locations of the new courses will not necessarily be tied to any one of the eight Global Centers, although some proposals make use of locations where Columbia already offers study abroad programs, such as Reid Hall in Paris, Snyder said. Dean of General Studies Peter Awn said he was excited to be able to offer courses that engage in a “robust, multicultural environment” to his students, though he added that there should be i careful consideration about the placement of these courses in countries that have censorship =codes. . “There is no use in meeting in an environment without intellectual freedom,” Awn said, “though it all depends on the courses.” is The global education subcommittee still has yet to hammer out logistics, including ﬁnancial aid and language prerequisites. “We’Ve made it clear that this, for us, is a big priority to make summer experiences abroad available, at least to Columbia College undergraduates,available regardless of their l personal ﬁnancial situations,” Snyder said. ‘ “One of my goals, which I have stated many times, is to be able to offer every student in the College one funded summerexperience, whether it be an internship, fellowship or study ' abroad opportunity,” Valentini ' said in an email. For most study abroad programs, ‘students are required to have completed two years"" of college language courses or the equivalent to participate. But Snyder noted that this may not be a practical requirement, given the nature of some of the new courses. A Snyder said that the, goal of the subcommittee and faculty members spearheading this project is to provide students with opportunities that interest them most, from courses abroad to undergraduate research opportunities with faculty. “I think that we should offer global education opportunities that respect the diversity of student needs and interests,” Snyder added. “We want to have a menu that has lots of really good options for students and to allow students to pick the kind ~ of experience that will be good for them.” news@columbiaspectatorzcomAROUND THE WORLD | Jack Snyder says the grant will fund new, exclusive study abroad classes."
169,Art Humanities,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR,25 November 2013,"To the editor: . The editorial titled “Fire M. Dianne Murphy” describes a partial solution for Columbia’s woeful athletic performance. But the solution proposed—for President Bollinger to bring in a new athletic director—does not address the real problem. Columbia Football has had a dismal history for the last 76 years. There have been nine winning seasons since 1937, many years with between zero and two wins, and no winning seasons since 1996. During that period, we have had many coaches and a variety of athletic directors. With each change has come hope, which is then replaced by disappointment and eventual frustration. This awful record speaks to fundamental problems with the football program, problems that the University has never, in three quarters of a century, identiﬁed and/ or articulated. And to a greater or lesser extent, these same problems carry over to many of our other teams. Because we have never identiﬁed the underlying’ problems, each time we have hired a new AD or coach all we have done is put a new face in the same old place. Each time we change, we hope that we have found a solution to our athletic problems, when we don’t even understand what the underlying problems are.It is time for this cycle of futility to end! While I totally agree with your conclusion that for a variety of reasons Murphy must go, I believe that before we repeat history by simply hiring a replacement AD, We should retain a competent, impartial outside consultant that is Q experienced in Working with athletic programs. This consultant should examine all of our programs and interview both past and current athletes, coaches, AD’s, faculty, and administration, as Well as non-athlete-students and alumni, to learn ﬁrst hand why our programs suck. If we get the right consultants and they do an eXcel- l lent job, perhaps they can identify those problems that “ clearly go far beyond the present AD and coaches. Once we have that information, perhaps We can solve these problems with a comprehensive plan that will hopefully l include a total reorganization of the athletic department. But have no illusions that the cures will be simple or inexpensive. And most importantly if they are to be successful, they will require that the entire Columbia community coalesce in support. Only then can the Lion once more Roar!

The answerstopped me in my tracks: “I want to love my God with allmy heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love my neighbor as myself.” . 7 I, like most of us, would have expected an answer like,‘ “I want to get an internship on Capitol Hill,” or “Try out a law ﬁrm,” or “Do research for the U.N.,” or “Teach for America!” But he gave me an answer that spoke ‘to “why,” not “what.” It was an answer steeped in the Core: straight out of Deuteronomy 625, the foundational statement of ancient Israel’s identity, and Jesus’ reiteration of that command in Luke 10:27. i ' Our ambitions to contribute , meaningfully to our families are p at least as Valid as our career a aspirations. . 9 ‘ But how surprising is it, really, that someone should dare give voice to something very ordinary and deeply human—the desire to livea life steeped in and shaped by love?

Barnard College President Debora Spar has recently contributed extensively to that conversation. Let’s broach thesubject of fatherhood, too, for husbands and wives who are both committed to seeing parenting as part of a meaningful life can embark on the daunting adventure of work and family together. The Core brings us into contact with traditions that deeply valued and validated fatherhood. Virgil sets up Aeneas as worthy to be the father of Rome because he is consistently pious-faithfully committed-—to his own father, Anchises, and his young son, Ascanius. In Art Humanities, we study Bernini’s sculpture of the unforgettable scene from the end of Book II of the Aeneid. Aeneas carries his father on his back, leading his son by the hand as Troy burns behind them. It is an archetype of rootednessin the past, a humble deference to the previous generation, and a courageous push by the present to prepare a. future for posterity. , ' . But men of Columbia don’t live in Aeneas’ world, and the idea of marrying and becoming a father-especially . soon after graduation—seems daunting. Some reasons are economic, although fortunately there are a few serious voices, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah among them, thinking about how tax reform in America could make raising a family easier. A lot of us also want to live in big cities like New York, which tend to be unwelcoming to small children. 7 We also live in a culture that encourages us to see ourselves as individuals above all else, a culture that does not emphasize the myriad tacit ways we depend on the families that raised us. If we believe that our achievements in life——including the very fact that we are here at Columbia——are primarily the result of our merit and not the result of our parents’ sacriﬁces, it is hard to prioritize fatherhood. But We know that growing up with the committed love of a dad is a wonderful gift. It can shape and prepare a child to engage conﬁdently with the world. . Perhaps the biggest reason to shy away from fatherhood is a very old one: Children are real people, and loving and caring for other human beings disrupt our lives in all sorts of ways. But we learn and grow the most from sacriﬁcing to love the least convenient people. _ I don’t have clear answers for what I’ll be doing after graduation or even where I’ll be for the summer. But I do certainly hope to someday-in a few years—be given the adventure of waking up over and over each night to tend to a squalling infant.

172,Art Humanities,IN GOOD FAITH,27 March 2014,"Exploring what Columbia means to its religious student population % V BY JOSHUA FATTAL \TLLUFSTR A%FTEFDFBY ANNI\[EsPINO[A%There is no shortage of communities at Columbia. Of allthe _sub—entities that comprise our diverse population, there are a number that fit under a single, broader category. This umbrella group is made up of all those students who see themselves as religiously afflliated—be it with a group, doctrine, way of life, or individual belief. The word “religious” is hard to define in a single way, as are the many religious personalities and -‘ groups that make up this campus. Indeed, there is a wide variety—too broad to detail—of backgrounds, interests, and intellectual or spiritual journeys in our community. In this realm especially, no two students are alike. Buththere is a thread that connects them all: their belief in something beyond the secular liberalism that has come to define our age. These are not the only students who search for, and sometimes find, deeper meaning in their environment. But for openly religious students in particular, a number of central questions take on added ‘meaning: Has the University left intellectual room for spirituality? How do reason and faith relate in the classroom? And how do religious ‘students interact with the environment surrounding them? While no student speaks for anyone but themselves, and no one storytcould contain the fullness of these stu~ ’ dents’ ways of life, this piece will attempt to explore a small segment of the vast and rich story of religion at Columbia. e AN ANGLICAN LEGACY The history of religion at Columbia begins much earlier than the founding of Hillel or the Muslim Students Association. Dating back to the earliest discussions at the beginning of the 18th century, the idea of establishing an institution of higher learning in the Province of New York was tied to the service of _ the Anglican Church. In 1704, Lewis Morris, the chief justice of New York and the British governor of New Jersey, wrote to the missionary arm of the Anglican Church, saying that New York was an ideal place to establish a college. "" I At the time, college was as much a religious institution as it was a scientiﬁc and literary one. In 1746, when the College of New Jersey (now Princeton) ’ was about to be founded, the general ' assembly of New York appointed a commission of 10 people—seven of whom were Anglicans—to direct the - ~ recently accrued funds to establish a college, which would later become Columbia. The commission voted to ' build the college on lands that had been vested to Trinity Church, on . the condition that the college’s religious affiliation would be Anglican. And yet, despite the way in H which Columbia was founded— Withreligiousintenmnsinmindr it was not created to train clergy,unlike its peer institutions. “The earliest of the lvies were colleges born out of American Protestantism and were initially founded to train clergy. Columbia was Anglican—-and as a King’s College, was a bit different. Harvard, Yale, and Princeton were each founded ’ because the previous ones became too liberal, ’7 Wayne Proudfoot, Columbia professor of religion, says. In 1784, the New York State Legislature passed an act that prohibited the newly founded college from administering a “religious test—oath” to its faculty. Proudfoot still sees this legacy in Columbia’s religion department today, ‘which came into its modern form in the 19505. In contrast to its peer institutions——at which the faculty of undergraduate program irl religion mirrored that of a Protestant seminary—the department at Columbialinacsllgfided scholars of religions from across the globe fré’£‘;fßs_ earliest years. - nu alsrz er 9*’ A RELIGION AN D'iIiI;IASON CONFLICTS IN THE CLASSROOM ’ Today on Columbia’s campus, the facade of Earl Hall—the building that houses the Office of the Urli—versity Chaplain~ contains the following engraving: “Erected for the Students that Religion and Learning May Go Hand in Hand with Knowledge.” In his recent book College: What It Was, Is, and Should Be, Colum—bia professor Andrew Delbanco suggests that placing these words on the building at the time of its estab—lishment in the early 1900 s meant that contemporaries probably no longer believed it. “As for religion, it was becoming an anachronism, and was certainly 1 no longer at the center of campus life,” he writes. Delbanco’s take on the engraving raises two issues central to the topic of religion at Columbia. The first isacademic: Just how detached has religion become from knowledge more generally in a 2014 Columbia education? Have the two become totally bifurcated, or is there room to allow “religion” and “knowl—- ’ edge” to struggle with each other and even, possibly, to coexist? . Zach Hodges, a Columbia College junior, came to Columbia from an atheist home where religion “was sometimes the object of our ridicule.” Owing in large part to his Columbia education, Hodges underwent a religious transformation and has come to identify himself as a “truth—seeker” who is interested in Buddhist philosophy and practice. For some students like Hodges, classes at Colum— ’ bia can be transformative religious experiences. “You walk in and see reality one way, and you walk out and see it another way, ” Hodges says of professor Robert Thurman’s class on Indo—Tibetan Buddhism. “Thur—man made some clearly‘ compelling ideas about the ‘ question of meaning, about why we’re here, and what we’re doing here.” Hodges explains that the class, ‘ in his mind, very much attacked the idea of nihilism—the philosophy that life is without meaning or intrinsic purpose. Columbia’s affiliation with the Union Theological Seminary and the Jewish Theological Seminary may give some Columbia students the opportunity to explore faith in more academic settings. For Hodges, a lecture by a professor of theology at UTS, Paul Krlit—ter, provided a “mandate for personal transformation. ” Knitter’s lecture emphasized that “If we are able to unify around this thing called love, and think deeply and critically about what the implications of this faith claim are on our lives, then we see that it’s our duty to embody that truth personally.” Hodges strongly believes that one of academia”s main goalsequipping us to transform and improve the structures around us—cannot be-done without first transforming ourselves. . ‘ But Hodges criticized the way in which Columbia’s academic departments often . don’t speak to each other in a way that . ' could allow for students to undergo this personal as well as academic transformation. “I had this Bud- ‘ . dhism class on Thursday and philosophy class on Friday, and the philosophers would say that the ‘ modes of analysis in the Buddhist realm aren’t real because we’Ve . got this method which is holy,” Hodges says. He feels that both modes of analysis are “incredibly ’ penetrating analyses” of what reality is, but “one was happening in meaning, and one was hhppehhhg h hhhh Ofmeaﬂing-""’ whh the hhhhht chss hhh tention to questions of the meaning of life, Hodges found that the philosophy class failed to do so.Speaking about the Core, Hodges had less than positive things to say. “lfl was running a university,” he says, “I would teach things differently.” He found that the Core fits into the “enlightenment ideology” that Columbia is all about, which thinks about notions of progress in a very particular way. “I think that not engaging questions of meaning is not being truthful to truth,” Hodges explains. Angad Singh, a Columbia College sophomore and a member of Columbia’s Sikh community, comments on “how Western everything We’re learning is.” While he spoke appreciatively of Columbia—that introduced him to a canon of thought he was previously unfamiliar. with—Singh expresses how he wishes “we could study Eastern thought for the sake of people who have never been exposed to it. Because while there are so many values that have ties in both schools, there is also so much that is different.” ' Kate Christensen, a Barnard College senior and an observant Mormon, saw even more of a reasonfaith divide in the Columbia curriculum than Hodges. While she argues that from an ofﬁcial perspective Columbia is very accommodating of religious communities and observances, “intellectually, there aren’t a lot of accommodations. It doesn’t seem to be part of Columbia’s identity at all,” she says. “You never read anything in the schools’ promotional materials about how Columbia’s diversity includes its representation of myriad faiths.” Like Hodges, Christensen thinks a space more welcome to notions of spirituality and religion would ‘only benefit the school. “I think it would ' be enriching to everyone if this space was made and destigmatized,” she says. Universities are in a tough spot because they have to teach students that everything can be proven by logic, she argues. But this kind of adherence to logic sometimes functions to its detriment. Citing the physical education requirement, Christensen wondered, “If you’re offering a holistic experience of growth, why aren’t younoffering pathways for spirituality?” ' "" _ THE RQLE OF THE TEACHER Yonah Hain, the Columbia campus rabbi and a united campus minister for the Office of the University Chaplain, speaks positively about the UniVersity’s lack of institutional involvement in religion. “Columbia doesn’t ask students to check off religious affiliation. I believe in that,” he says. “At the same time, the University is always asking me about what’s healthy for the Jewish community.” For Hain, the lack of explicitly religious involvement on the University’s part is a good thing, and does not styrnie students’ religious growth. “Formany students, there is this exposure to wisdom, _ literature, and the world of reason—which also opens the door for them to explore Judaism,” he says. But Hain cautions against mistaking this with believ— . ing that professors should be encouraged to openly express their views on religion and spirituality. “Professors have earned their right to say their ideas,” he says, but “I always think about what’s effective from a pedagogical standpoint, and I wouldn’t Want students to check out because they thought Iwas being insensitive.” In the traditional understanding of the faith—reason divide, the philosophy department, as Zach Hodges suggests, should stand opposite of the religion department. Philip Kitcher, a philosophy professor who has offered a course on science and religion in the past, suggests that this divide might exist, but that it’s unimportant. “I think» the philosophy department would be less than perfectly friendly to religion if it thought about it,” he says. “But the predominant View is that we have more important things to think about. ’_’ Speaking about his own classroom experiences teaching Contemporary Civilization, Kitcher notes how “one thing that struck me is how not fraught the discussion is. People don’t get madly upset.” Kitcher observes that religious ' discussions in the classroom are often both profitable and friendly. James Lin—a Columbia College junior and the outgoing president of Columbia Faith and Action, a Christian fellowship on campus—recounts several instances where the classroom environment wasn’t as friendly as Hain and Kitcher suggest. In his CC class, his “professor made a blanket statement, without leaving any room for discussion, that one of the clear faults in the book of Romans is that Paul says that homosexuality is immoral.” Statements such as this can be polarizing in an otherwise open classroom. In Frontiers of Science, “the professor was making jokes about how only silly people believe there was a great ﬂood on the earth.” Lin expresses disappointment in these atmospheres, since they “don’t foster discussion at all.” Since these instances, Lin has been struggling with how a student should respond. “Do you just kind of sit there and take it? You want to be gracious and , respectful, but you also want to be fll'l’l’l on your view—point, even if it runs against your classmates or your professor,” he said. Coming out of these experiences, Lin talks about how refreshing it has been to have his Art Humanities class taught by a Muslim, who teaches with his own worldview in mind, but also respectfully presents and encourages differing perspectives that allow for more vibrant dialogue.- But are the challenges Lin raised indicative of a pattern of antireligious sentiment in the classroom? Kitcher argues for a more nuanced understanding, I describing his own pedagogical method. “What I v Want to do is get people to interpret their own religious convictions, not necessarily to change them. I’m- for deepening of opinions, and I hope that this leads people away from dogmatism and literalism. ” Without forcing any opinion on students, Kitcher believes that, “what should come out of this is a much more humane and thoughtful and understanding ap—proach to religious issues.” Proudfoot echoes some of Kitcher’s remarks, ex—plaining the way in which he teaches religious texts. “I try to teach each text to give the best argument for the text itself,” he explains. But also, “We’re not just parroting something back. We’re trying to think I about the material. I don’t parade my own views, but ‘we get into discussions and debates when I’m sure they come through, which is fine.” Speaking to how these courses may inﬂuence a student, Proudfoot A says, “I’m not surprised if it affects someone one Way or another. We’re not just spectators.” BOLSTERING FAITH THROUGH LEARNING For other religious students, the classroom has contributed positively to their faith. Haris Durrani,a School of Engineering and Applied Science junior and president of the Columbia Muslim Students As—sociation, explains how his decision to concentrate in Middle East South Asian African studies played a large role in the way in which he intellectually developed his religious beliefs. “I was able to develop What it means to be a Muslim m the larger context, and what Islam means in its many forms, ” he says. Durrani pointed to one specific class—Central Questions in lslarnic Law with MESAAS professor Wael Hallaq—-as life—changing for him. Hallaq showed Shariah to be less rigid than it is often assumed to be, and explained how there can be a plurality of opinions on the meaning of the law. For Durrani, this is exactly the kind of faith he looks for. “HoW ljtruly find faith in God is through _ thinking,” he says, “and coming to understand my religion in a more complex and deep way.” A Juliana Strawn, a Barnard College senior and an active member of Columbia’s Canterbury Club, is an Episcopal student studying to become a priest. She explains how. the Episcopal Church irl Alabama, where she is from, had a history of being proslavery. “Coming here, I’ve learned so much about kinds if of laws, and specifically things in capitalism and in politics, that have excluded certain classes of people so often,” she says. “My exposure to it at Columbiahas made me see things in a much broader view—you have to take the past into consideration when you talk about systems of oppression.” For Strawn, a Columbia education has quite literally impacted the way she understands her Christian beliefs. Talking about how the Episcopal Church ~ ordains women, and what she gained from reading feminist texts, Strawn says, “Coming here and learning how to read critically and think on my own has led me to come to a lot of beliefs that I Wouldn’t have come to reading biblical text alone.” Luke Foster, a Columbia College junior and president of the Veritas Forum, appreciates the way in which the Core teaches both sides to students. “You’re reading some of the most articulate skeptics, as well as some of the most articulate believers, ”. he says. The fact that the curriculum highlights the Greco—Roman classical legacy, the Jewish legacy, and the Christian experience with the New Testament, according to Foster, shows how’ the faith-reason tension has existed for many years, “and being able to look down the centuries and see that provides guidance for the struggles of our own day.” But at the same time, Foster points to the lack of -spirituality that Hodges and Christensen alluded to. “The president of the University used to teach every class of graduating seniors ethics,” Foster recounts of Columbia up until the early 20th century. “Bollinger understands his role very differently, and there is something lost there.” Foster’s criticism goes beyond just the president’s role, touching on a deeper issue that goes to the heart of what education is meant to be today. “By and large, the faculty, the deans they don’t see themselves as having a sense that they are forming people, even though that’s exactly what they’re doing, ” Foster says, but noted that a number of professors do take on this role. FAITH AND DOUBT For many students at Columbia, the classroom is a kind of rationally rigorous environment where ‘predisposed ideas and beliefs act solely as a point of departure for each individual student. But for many religious students, the nature of the classroom is inherently a challenge, because it ignores some of the premises that they start outwith. How do re~ ligious students tackle this divide themselves - just how open are they to ideas that differ from their own beliefs, and how do they view their own time at the University? Some students placed their openness to tackle religion intellectually in the context of a search for truth “with a capital T.” Hodges believes that this kind of truth can be felt “on a visceral level.” It isn’t some— t.thing that can be agreed on in a seminar, though, he explains: “It’s something we must experience for ourselves.” Does he doubt the existence of Truth sometimes? “Of course, doubt is completely taking a part in this,” he says. “One of the traditions of Buddhism is that the essential thing you must cultivate on the path to enlightenment is your doubt. You must doubt ‘everything you hear, and you must pass it through everything you have in your toolbox.” “Faith in love is Truth,” Hodges argues, but continues, “People who hesitate to make that leap don’t recognize that in there somewhere is faith.” For Hodges, the belief that the ﬂoor won’t instantaneous— A ly vanish beneath us is also a kind of faith, making it - “interesting that people are afraid to critically analyze what the concept of faith is, given that in my opinion so much of existence is faith.” L Christensen also touches on the idea of truth with a c-apital T. “My father always stressed to me that truth is truth—your religion is truth, so everything you pursue in your education should contribute to that truth. If something doesn’t make sense, you quite’ possibly just need to study it out more to make sense i of it.” What exactly does she see Truth to be? “Something that is true is something that has the potential to make sense to you, and be applied to help you resolve something, pursue something,” she says. Mormonism holds that human beings exist in the afterlife, taking their earthly knowledge with them, Christensen explains, and so “life—learning is important because it fits very well into the cyclical grand scheme of life.” A number of students suggested that a secular education plays a critical role in their understanding of religion. Ethan Herenstein—a Columbia College sophomore, philosophy major, and member of Yavneh, Hillel’s Orthodox Jewish community—ex—plains, “I like to allow my classes to reform and edify my religious life mostly in an intellectual sense.” _ “It’s important to me to look at religion not in a Vacuum. It’s about reinvestigating what I’ve already taken for granted from an academic and historical perspective,” he says. “If I’m learning Plato, I’ll look at points that connect between Plato and other Jewish ideas. It isn’t a.clash, but a complement between the two.” « v ' Herenstein reiterates Kitcher’s ideas about moving away from literalism. “Whether or not the stories in the Bible happened is completely irrelevant to me. The Values that underlie the narratives that they conv/ey is the most important part,” he says. 7 Strawn echoes Herenstein’s comments. “When you hear a debate about evolution,_it’s either one or the other,” she says. “No one wants to entertain the idea that both can be true to some extent.

173,Art Humanities,"Students, faculty value liberal arts at SEAS",28 March 2014,"BY YASEMIN AKCAGUNER Spectator Senior Staﬁ‘Wrz'ter ‘ Unlike most engineering schools, the School of Engineering and Applied Science offers components of a liberal arts education—something SEAS Dean Mary Boyce calls “critical to engineers and scientists of the 21st century.” _ In additionto their technical core courses, SEAS students take a modified version of Columbia College’s Core Curriculum, and SEAS students can elect to take a liberal arts minor. Since 1979, SEAS students have been required to take University Writing and the physical education requirement. They then have a choice"", between taking either Literature Humanities, Contemporary _ Civilization, or a Global Core sequence. They also must choose to take either Art Humanities or Music Humanities. , , ‘fEngineers today live and work in a global, multidisciplinary world with very ﬂuidgboundaries, and it is essential that they have broad-based intellectual skills—that they have the ability to think, Work, and act in both an analytic and synthetic Way, bringing together ideas from diverse fields and merging these into a cohesive, problem-solving approach to world» issues,” Boyce said. . - t In 2002, SEAS began to allow students to take liberal arts minors in English, history; political science, philosophy, music, and architecture—an initiative of the Engineering Student Council.Former Dean Zvi Galil supported the resolution and saw it to fruition. ’ “Engineering education is the best because of the Core. They all cherish the Core.” —former SEAS dean E ‘ Zvi Galil S ‘ “I’m not sure how ‘popular it was a at the time,” Galil said in an interview : last month, adding that he thinks the liberal arts are essential in comple- - menting engineering. “Engineering education is the best because of the Core. They all cherish the Core. They all cherish the fact that they are educated people, they have a broad education, they can talk about ‘ everything,” Galil said. “This is a Wonderful advantage.” V Today, liberal arts minors are still an important part of a SEAS education for some students. , Ryan Morgan, SEAS ’l4, majors in civil engineering with a minor in political science. He said that liberal arts is important in the age of the startup, especially as entrepreneurship and . engineering become more closely linked. , V “The collaboration between kids who are coding and kids who are studying literature or political sciencewould be a lot more useful and create C some new innovations we haven’t seen before,” Morgan said; _ Still, Morgan, who took Art Humanities and Contemporary Civilization to fulfill his Core.requirements, said that while he chose Columbia because of its unique C availability of liberal arts courses to SEAS students, there was room for improvement. A - “I think a lot of engineering schools that I considered—say Cornell—don’t _ really offer that. And in schools like Caltech and MIT it gets more extreme. I think that’s one of the great things that Columbia engineering offers its students, the opportunity tointegrate liberal arts and engineering, - but it could definitely get stronger,” Morgan said. Indeed, while other engineer— 0 ing schools across the country have requirements for writing courses. similar to University Writing—like ‘ the communication requirement at MIT, where Boyce used to teachmany don’t» have the_ equivalent of the modified Core required of SEAS. students. Both Stanford and Cornell, paralleling that of many other engineering schools across the country, have requirements in which students can choose from. courses listed under broad categories like Stanford’s . “Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing” and Cornell’s “Cultural Analysis” requirement. V ' Morgan said he wants to see further integration of the Core in the SEAS curriculum requirements. .“It would be great if engineers would take Lit Hum with the rest of Columbia College,” Morgan said. “In terms of the Core, they should definitely make the requirements somewhat stronger and somewhat more integrated with that of Columbia College.” Claire Kao, SEAS ’l4 and a civil engineering major who also took Art Hum and Contempory Civilization, said that she loved her liberalnarts courses and made many Columbia College friends through them. “My friends who aren’t necessarily’ interested in liberal arts, they don’t have to do as much but those who want to can take full advantage of it as I have and as Ryan [Morgan] has,” Kao said. “I think people who come to Columbia engineering are self-selec- ° tive, they know that this is the place where you can do both.” , . _ . V I ‘ Kao also said that the fact that she has taken various liberal arts courses outside of her technical requirements helped her advance in her professional life. ' “I get to talk about the fact that I’ve taken a philosophy course and studio and languages,” Kao said. “People are really interested in the fact that I have this quantitative background and also supplemented it and had other interests.” I Various SEAS faculty members, like Upmanu Lall, a professor of civil engineering and earth and environmental engineering, have also acknowledged the role of liberal arts within their disciplines and research.“The education in the political and social sciences, and psychology inﬂuences what an engineerdesigns for and thinks about marketing their innovations,” Lall said. “Philosophy influences how we think about what we work on, and how to rationalize choices we make as to directions of research and their value.” Julia Hirschberg, the computer science department chair, said that liberal arts is an increasingly important part of SEAS, in both education and research, especially as its research grows more interdisciplinary. . “We often connect with faculty and students in the liberal arts at Columbia to discuss computational aspects of projects they are doing and sometimes to collaborate,” Hirschberg said. “We work with researchers in the humanities and social sciences and often exchange talks and meetings.” ’ Though Boyce said that there are no current plans to change the role of liberal arts in the SEA‘S curriculum, the increasing demand for interdisciplinary research and work is causing more demand for the integration of the liberal arts in the technical curriculum. “We are exploring different _ave- * nues for enhancing our engineering curriculum to further enhance creativity‘ and innovation throughout the curriculum and cocurricular activities,” she said.

174,Art Humanities,Traditions that venerate women are overlooked,9 April 2014,"BY LUKE FOSTER . ~ The Core Curriculum, with its power to open our minds and hearts, has a way of confronting us with unpalatable perspectives. If the ﬁelds of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities are like quiet pas- _ _ ture_s of contemplation tucked away above the clouds of our everyday assumptions, sometimes there is a stiff, cold windblowing in these uplands. And it can slap us in the face, abruptly and unpleasantly. The dearth of women authors in the Core is one such jarring reality. It is disconcerting that with all the poetry by women in the ancient world, not much survives beyond a few fragments of Sappho. Even in much more familiar and recent contexts, women’s voices have been marginalized. All of Evans’ ; work was published under a pseudonym, George Eliot. One common response to this problem is to read the women who did author Core texts—Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf- ‘ as speaking only for women. My Contemporary Civilization class spent a great deal of time asking if Wollstonecraft was a proto -feminist, and in Lit Hum we questioned whether Austen was trying to subvert the sexual norms of her time. What bothers me about this approach is that it canactually be degrading to the authors and their ideas. None of these authors were directly concerned with the political ideologies of our time, and we shouldn’t . try to ﬁt them into our categories, or repurpose their work for another meaning. To honor their achievements in providing insight into human nature is to _ be willing to listen to what they have to say about all _of our experiences. Austen is a brilliant satirist who introduces her readers to sparkling depths of subtlety in the most everyday conversations. We often assume that our age has progressed and N that women are better treated now than ever before. In manyvital areas, that claim is justiﬁed. In 21st—century Western society, fewer women die during childbirth ' than at any other point in our history. Today, Mary Ann Evans would be encouraged to publish her own work and regarded as an excellent writer in her own right. But one of the great merits of the Core is its power to let ideas from starkly different times speak for themselves. And just as we should respect and listen to other cultures on their own terms, we should extend the same generosity of spirit to our ancestors. . We sometimes stereotype the entirety of Western thought as a Faust—like ﬁgure: the rationalistic male intellectual who seduces, silences, and objectiﬁes ‘ Gretchen. But there is much more to the great tradition of the West than that. One of the tenderestmoments in the Iliad comes as Hector returns from the bloodshed to his Wife Andromache and his baby son Astyanax. Hector recognizes that male-Warrior glory, kleos, is only valuable because it protects the domestic realm that his wife governs. _ And the rise of Christianity in the ancient World provided further reason to dignify Women. The Gospel of Luke tells the story of the Virgin Mary and claims she changed history by choosing to bear and raise the baby Jesus. Mary’s song, the Magniﬁcat, proclaims, “From now on all generations will call me blessed,” and this elevation of motherhood to an ofﬁce of eternal glory would suffuse later Christian thought. Augustine, in his Confessions, acknowledges the saintliness of his mother Monica, a constant source of stability for him while he does his best to destroy himself. The Core exposes us to a tradition that ennobled and honored women as mothers, even as it often conﬁned women to the domestic sphere. It's Worth asking ourselves whether our contemporary culture is truly better at valuing women. Yes, We do better at acknowledging the excellence of Women, but we tend to measure excellence in quantiﬁable achievements like earning a paycheck or contributing to the GDP. ‘ The vast sacriﬁce of health, time, and love that millions of mothers—including my own-—give to their children is too often denigrated. Prioritizingmotherhood should be an honored choice for Women to make. But the dominant narrative is that an excellent education shouldn’t be channeled into raising children. Too many college campuses, including ‘ Columbia, fail to do enough to help student mothers. The ﬁnal Week of Art Humanities, last spring made this point tangible for me. My professor juxtaposed Raphael’s’ Sistine Madonna and Picasso’s Les Demoiselles Diélvignon. The 16th-century painting integrated all its elements, with harmony and grace, around the queenly poise of Mary, the Mother of God And the 20th-century cubist piece rendered the viewer complicit in the horrifyingvoyeurism of the female body stripped down to an object The Core hammered home to me the irony that, even though there are more women in board rooms and in faculty lounges than ever before, the Western world has become complacent with a vast industry dedicated to the obj ectiﬁca—tion of women: pornography. _ Clearly, in some vital Ways, we are missing wisdom that our ancestors would have taken for granted. We should honor the women of the Core for their excellence, not just for their politics, and we should also allow the Core to challenge us to strive for a more complete vision of Women’s dignity.

175,Art Humanities,"Ink art at intersection of language, identity",11 April 2014,"When I was learning to write Chinese charac—ters as a child, carefully crafting each stroke into tiny boxes for 2 practice, I kept myself enter—tained by thinking of writing as - 1 1 drawing. JG A N NA Speciﬁcally, I thought of L E E drawing snowﬂakes, only black . g and inky instead of white and F 0"" “d m cold, smudging and bleeding . . . Translation intozﬁié p‘ap.jerinstééicLbfrxielt:: l ing and sinkinginto the soil. . . It made sense—~after all, each Chinese character seemed like a complex and unique geometrical pattern, just as snowﬂakes were. Chinese is a language composed of logograms, in which graphic rather than phonetic symbols serve as the basic unit of the language. This means that it is an extremely pictorial language, and one that inspires my imagination even now. , As a result, the Chinese language has had a close relationship with Chinese visual arts both traditionally and in the modern day. In traditional Chinese .shan shui paintings, language always accompanies image—it is artful not only on a linguistic level, but on avisual and spiritual level as well. “A Brush with Asia,” an ink art exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, focuses precisely on this relationship and the way it is being explored and re-evaluated by contemporary Chinese artists. a It is fascinating how being able to read Chinese impacts one’s experience of the art in this particular exhibit. While my companion responded to the re-evaluation of the signiﬁcance of the Chinese language with cultural interest, I felt deeply disturbed by much of the art on display that manipulated Chinese characters. Often, the art rendered the characters unreadable or dislocated them from their meanings. In other words, the art made the ' Chinese language gibberish, and in so doing, made me illiterate. . This was how.l ﬁrst felt when I encounteredXu Bing’s “A Book from the Sky”—which features in the exhibit- in my Art Humanities class. Bing, a U.S.-based Chinese artist, shockedthe entire Chinese—reading community with this piece, and I can understand why. In that particular class, my professor asked if anyone could read Chinese, and being the only person whose hand was raised, I was instructed to read the words from his “book” that she put up on screen. To my horror, I was completely unable to. Growing embarrassed, I panicked before ﬁnally conceding defeat and telling her I could not recognize the characters. It turns out that what Bing had created was exactly what its Chinese title suggests—tian-shu translates literally as sky-book but is really a euphemism for nonsense. And nonsense was all I could make out when I looked at the characters on the screen and later at the exhibition. Bing had created characters that resembled Chinese ones, arbi- . V trarily assigned them meaning, and wrote a book ‘ with them. Brilliantly, he had created a language and masqueraded it as another. It is intuitive for us to attribute cultural signiﬁcance to language. Language has thus been a strong rallying point for Chinese people throughout history, and today, it is especially so for Chinese diaspora all over the world. What “A Brush with Asia” questions is that relationship between language and cultural identity. The Chinese language is questioned, explored, manipulated—deconstructed, as it were, calling intogquestion the identity of the Chinese speaker, reader, and writer. ' What are you really reading? That was the question the exhibition left me thinking about. As I walked away from the exhibition, contemplating my answer, I couldn’t help but smile when a simple memory popped into my head.

Art Humanities and Music Humanities will be offered at l Reid Hall in the spring of 2015, a change that comes as Columbia pushes to expand its Englishlanguage offerings abroad. The music and art history de- ' partments applied separately to bring courses to Paris and have spent the past year designing and coordinating their individual courses. The expansion of both courses will be funded by a $2.1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, which faculty and administrators are using to design and teach courses abroad. According to Dean of Undergraduate Global Programs Michael Pippengen the grant “was given to Columbia to help globalize the liberal arts.” Though the courses will be taught simultaneously next spring, further scheduling will depend on students’ responses and faculty availability. Music department chair Giuseppe Gerbino is . conﬁdentboth courses are at Reid Hall to stay, and he said a summer course may also be in the Works. “Going forward, we will offer, of course, both the courses at least once a year—which isto say either in the fall or in the spring,” Gerbino said. “The calendar itself is not necessarily ﬁxed at thispoint. The maximum capacity for this would befall, spring, a summer.” » Though Paris is already the most popular location for Columbia undergraduate study abroad, Gerbino said he hopes the ability to fulﬁll Core requirements will attract even more Columbia students to Reid Hall.

177,Art Humanities,CCSC plans return of Columbia College Days,16 October 2014,"BY DYLAN COOPER Spectator Staﬁ"" Writer Two years after Columbia College Student Council chose to replace College Dayswith the Columbia Music Festival, student leaders are now planning to reinstate the Weeklong celebration of Columbia College spirit. Tentatively scheduled for the ﬁrst week of April, CCSC members said they want to build each day around a different Core Curriculum class. 1 “In Columbia College, there’s a need for big headliner events that the campus could rally around,” CCSC Vice President for Campus Life Andrew Ren, CC ’l5, said. “And College Days could do just that.” College Days will launch with an opening ceremony and campus-wide displays celebrating Literature Humanities Day. The rest of the week will include Contemporary Civilization Day highlighting Columbia’s history, Art Humanities Day featuring stu- V dent artwork and workshops, and Swim Test Day focusing on more fun activities and promoting selfcare tips. Global Core/Science Requirement Day will feature events organized by student groups, while Ren said he wants to work with campus music groups to organize performances‘ for Music Humanities Day. g “In coming up with a framework, it is crucial that College Days would have a very organized structure,” Ren said. “We want to create a template that could be instituted for future yearsas well.” » Ren said that having experienced College Days as a ﬁrst-year, he thinks there is a lack of events speciﬁcally geared toward’promoting Columbia College spirit. “There was a conspicuous absence of something celebrating being a Columbia College student and that’s why the event is in existence,” he said. Engineering Student Council has held an annual Engineering Week featuring speakers, workshops, and activities since 1996, while Barnard’s Student Government Association holds an armual Spirit Week in April, thelatest iteration of Barnard’s longrunning Greek Games tradition. CCSC created College Days in 2002, and the initiative expanded—and became more expensive—every year. The 2004 week featured a scavenger hunt with a $4OO grand prize and a $2OO dinner with an alumnus as the sec-ond-place prize. The spring 2012 week had a budget of $20,000 and featured multiple giveaways by the council. “The scavenger hunt was really fun and people liked it a lot,” Chloe Good, CC ’O6, one of the organizers of College Days that year said. “The reason we didn’t do it again was it was very logistically heavy.” CCSC canceled College Days in December that year, opting to use the money to host the Columbia Music Festival in the week leading up to the Bacchanal spring concert. Some students said that they would be interested in having special Core classes during the week. “I think it’s pretty obvious Columbia’s lacking in the spirit department,” Bryan Kao, CC ’lB, said. “Hopefully College Days will give us something to look forward to in the spring.” “College Days would deﬁnitely appeal to seniors because it’d be a refreshing recap of the Core,” Michael Schiff, CC ’l5, said. “Being a part of grade-wide CC lecture, for example, could be really interesting if they brought in a famous or iconic lecturer.” This year’s College Days ap- ' pears to be a shift away from previous years’ giveaway- driven events. ' Schiff said that he would like College Days to include largerscale events that could catch students’ attention. “It’d be really nice to see a grand display around campus or some type of performing arts entertainment on Low Steps,” he said. “The idea is to have a mix of active participation and passive events ‘ depending on the day, where you as a student are able to engage as much or as little as you’d want,” Ren said. dylan.cooper @coZumbiaspectator.com"
178,Art Humanities,"Lindsay Hadad, GS",20 May 2015,"BY SASHA ZIENTS Spectator Staﬁ” Writer Valedictorian Lindsay Hadad, GS ’l5, is no stranger to academic success. But when she first found out that she was the 2015 GS Valedictorian, Hadad said that she was paralyzed with doubt about her ability to givean adequate speech at the ceremony. “I felt I did not deserve it,” Hadad, who faced early battles with mental illness and self doubt, said in a phone interview Sunday. Hadad was on the Dean’s List every semester at Columbia and the co-re-cipient of the 2015 Phi BetaKappa Award, whichis given to the GS senior elected to the honor society who best exemplifies “intellectual integrity, tolerance for others’ views, and a broad range of academic interests.” . A native New Yorker, Hadad was raised by IsraeliAmerican parents and grew up as the middle of three daughters. She enrolled in college right after graduating from Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School in New York, but severe depression and an eating disorder led her to drop out of college early. “It took years to get back on my feet,” Hadad said. She started working at a high-end antique jewelry store, but she craved a job that would allow her to work more with people, specifically people who suffered from forms of addiction. “The jewelry store job felt empty,” Hadad said. “And my eating disorder was like an addiction, so I can relate to addictions like alcoholism, where you have a twisted mentality and all you care about is your fix.”So Hadad returned to college. She spent a year at the Borough of Manhattan Community College before she matriculated to GS, where she juggled a two-hour commute to school, her job at the jewelry store, and attending classes-all while maintaining a perfect grade point average. Professors who have taught Hadad praised her academic success and personal strength. “She was admired by her peers for her willingness to share al when they were relevant to what we were studying,” Marjorie Silverman, an adjunct psychology professor at Barnard who taught Hadad for a semester, said in an email. “Her careful listening, compassion and mastery of the material will all serve to make her an excellent clinician, one who is able to help people in psychological distress.”g Kathryn Chiong, a lecturer in the Department of Art History and Archaeology and Hadad’s Art Humanities teacher, was not at allsurprised that Hadad earned the Valedictorian honors. Chiong said that Hadad impressed her with her deep commitment to her studies and her work ethic. “What impressed me the most about Lindsay was thefact that she was able to achieve so much, in such a competitive environment, while still remaining such a warm and genuinely thoughtful individual,” Chiong wrote in an email Monday.

179,Art Humanities,Boyce renews spirit at SEAS,29 October 2015,"New InltlatlVes, faculty hll'€S school Spectator Senior Staff Writer Two and a half years into her tenure, School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Mary Boyce has brought renewed en- t ergy to the school, sparking the"" creation of a series of initiatives that has reanimated both faculty and students. ' Columbia trumpeted Boyce’s appointment as a high-pro-ﬁle hire in March 2013 after the University stole Boyce away from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where ‘ she had taught for over 25 years. Her appointment marked the end of a Volatile decade for SEAS, following former Dean ' Feniosky Peﬁa-Mora’s resignation after SEAS faculty passed a vote of “no conﬁdence” in him. Her appointment helped put SEAS on the map, according to Robert McCaughey, a history professor at Barnard and the author of “A Lever Long Enough: A History of Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science Since 1864.” “She is an important person in her discipline, coming fromthe top engineering school in the. world, a member of the National Academy of Engineering. She came in with instant impact in terms of the visibility of the institution,” Mccaugheyésaid. “And then from everything I hear, she’s "" performed as expected.” ' According to administrators, faculty and students inter- » viewed by Spectator, Boyce has successfully fostered interdis- ' ciplinary collaboration with the other schools at the University, S authorizeda series of signiﬁcant renovations, and worked to emphasize to students how exciting engineering is. “I think Columbia missed a coupleof turns in the wheel , when engineering was revived in the ‘6os and ‘7os, and places like MIT and Stanford re- . ally took advantage of them and Columbia kind of fumbled along,” McCaughey said. “This round, I think Columbia has moved as smartly as any.” _ I TRANSCENDING DISCIPLINES A central tenet of Boyce’s vision is to enable engineering students and faculty to tackle _ the “global challenges of the ‘ world” through interdisciplinary work. “We’re looking now that our engineering education is a foundational education,” Boyce said. ’ “At the undergraduate level, we do consider a key part of that [to be] our requirement of a part of the core curriculum, because we think that also informs the broader perspectiveof our role in the world, and how engineeringcomes to bear on that.” Engineering students * at Columbia are required to take half of the humanities core; they choose between Literature Humanities, ‘ Contemporary Civilization, or V two Global Core courses, and either Art Humanities or Music Humanities. The approach is one that Boyce believes distinguishes SEAS from its peers and appeals to. students who value interdisciplinary collaboration. V “We are attracting students who seeengineering in that foundational way,” Boyce said. “So I do think we attract anincredible talent that is broader than what you mightsee in some other top engineering schools.” V 4 .According to McCaughey, Boyce’s interest in pursuing interdisciplinary work is the_ continuation of work that administrators at SEAS began in the 19905. . ' ' “I don’t think [the emphasis on transdisciplinary collaboration] can be attributed to the most recent clean, but I think what Dean Boyce. has ' recognized is that that is one . of the key elements in the perceived success of_ the institution and engineering school,” McCaughey, said. “And I think it’s now the case that you cannot , think seriously of any collaboration within the University that does not include the engineering school.” i According to Soulaymane Kachani, senior vice dean for academic programs at SEAS, past administrators had also hoped to foster interschool, collaboration, but there was “nothing that was meaningful that came with that” “until Boyce came to campus. “She came here and said,‘ ‘We have to ""cross to all the schools, to all the disciplines, and see where we can add value,”’ Kachani said. “It’s not like we ' weren’t doing that before, [but] I donit think we were doing it in an organized way.” One of the most notable ex— ’ amples of this visionhas been‘ the creation of the Ebola design challenge in 2014. The challenge, which spanned the . course’ of two weeks, tasked participants from SEAS and the Mailman School of Public Health to work in teams to develop a low—cost, technology- » driven -solution that would meet a challenge‘ posed by’ the outbreak of Ebola. The chalv lenge sparked‘ the creation of Highlight, a powdered bleach additive that can beused to decontaminate infectious diseases. The invention won the USAID Fighting ‘Ebola Grand » ‘Challenge and has sincebeen r incorporated into the New York City Fire Department’s HazMat unit decontamination protocol. ' r Boyce, who created the event after discussing the Ebola crisiswith Mailman School of Public Health Dean Linda Fried, herself participated in the challenge, serving as a research adviser. .. . _ Ritish Patnaik,’ SEAS ’l6, A praised the event, and noted that it allowed him to work with Boyce not in the capacity of anadministrator, but as a researcher. . “I came to the Ebola design challenge kickoff presentation, and I was interested‘ in the idea . of protective suits. The next day, . Dean Boyce is sitting there, and she’s sketching out a suit, and I had a sketch‘ of a suit in my backpack, and we sat down and started compiling our sketches , and working together,” Patnaik said. . “She would take time out of her day to come down to the BME [biomedical engineering] ‘ lab just to see how things were going, to see‘ if she could give us advice,” he added. Boyce also has worked to collaborate with the Business School, spearheading the? creation of a new class called . Research to Revenue-, which will be offered to business and engineering students in the first V half of sprilngsyemester. The course will encourage students to work in teams to tackle both -the technical and entrepreneur- . ial challenges of developing technology. ‘ . » “Something Dean Boyce v wants to do is not just think, about these ideas, but really do them. And that’s why we are offering this as soon as possible, not waiting until next year,” Sam Sia, an associate professor of biomedical engineering who is helping to craft the course, said. “We want to"",d9_.-,_it now “and we want to giveiiltlsltadents resources now.” I a . INVESTMENTS IN FACULTY AND SPACE Perhaps the largest challenge facing SEAS‘ that Boyce habislought to tackle has been I ' the school’s space constraints. »Crunch_ed for laboratory space, faculty and students havehistorically felt the coiggequences of Columbia’s spaéellimitations acutely. This probl3ﬁ%*that has directly affected tl3l:el'school’s V ability to competitively recruit faculty.*""‘lt’s a limiting factor. You want to be able to do your research, and you need to have the space to do your research. It’s probably how you’re going to A get tenure,” David Vallancourt, . a senior lecturer in circuits and systems in the department of electrical engineering, said. ' But under Boyce’s leadership, SEAS has invested in a series of renovations, expanding S and refurbishing lab and ofﬁce spaces. ‘ . = ' “We’re undergoing some rathermassive renovations to build out and bring more labs up to the level we need to be at for the type of work we’re doing. That’s a major priority of the school,” Boyce said. “We have a big effort to try to bring our current spaces up to , the level where I think we need ‘ to be.” ‘ g A A Those construction proj-« ects have included renovations to biomedical engineering and electrical engineering teaching labs, the creation of an ' electron microscopy labora- . tory, and the creation of 8,400 square feet of faculty office space, conference rooms, and i open areas for research collaboration and meetings for the Data Science Institute. SEAS has also been. allot- . ted a plotof land on the new . Manhattanville campus. “She has the passion to crev ate not only physical space that satisfies ‘faculty need, but . she thinks about ‘how do we, make it long term and beneﬁcial and sustainable and efﬁcient,”’ SEAS Senior Executive Vice Dean Shih-Fu Chang said. “When you. create a space, it makes sense to invest a little more today so you can later on use this infrastructure.” . The investments in creating laboratory and ofﬁce space have also facilitated an increase in faculty hires—-22 new faculty members have joined SEAS in .i the past year‘ alone: ' '1 ""“lsean""B""oyee has».deﬁnite'ly~ made hiring of world class faculty a priority}? Garud Iyengar, the chair of the industrial engineering and operations research department, wrote in an email, “lEOR has added four new faclrulty since she arrived on campus. This is approximately a 20 percent increase in the facultyS count. And we are looking to hire two more faculty members this year.” According to Kachani, the expansion in faculty hires is . indicative of the dynamic vision Boyce brought with her to ’ SEAS. . “She came and she said, ‘We’ have to be a lot more risk taking. So instead of growing modestly over many years, let’s make ‘bold movement of growing the school from _a faculty side, enhancing. our structure and we will ﬁgure it out,”’ Kachani said. “To be honest, previous deans would not have done what Mary has done. They would have done it at a slower pace.” A r MAKING ENGINEERING EXCITING A V ' For decades, aperception ex- . isted that SEAS did not receive the recognition it deserved . within the University, with former dean ZviGalil once de- A scribing it as an “adopted child.” “I think Columbia has taken. ' a very long time to recognize the‘ importance of an applied science component to a real university,” McCaughey said. “Now that’s totally gone.” . But even as thelschool has ireclleivedlgreater recognition, Boyce is still working to distinguish the school, emphasiz- . ing to both SEAS students and members of the University community that engineering is “an incredible ﬁeld to be in.” V . “We want to really celebrate the incredible projects students do as part of their curr_iculum and to really-open that up to the entire Columbia community to see what great things our students are doing,” Boyce said.‘ To fostenexcitement, Boyce revamped the annual schoolS wide senior design exposition that showcases the culmination of graduating seniors’ work. Once a series of small, informal "" departmental events, Boyce created a single school-wide event in Lerner‘ Hall to highlight the V ‘sen=_iors"" designs andlinvited the public to attend.‘ I “The expo was something we talked about off andlon for quite some time «but she re-A ally got behind it and made it happen,” Vallancourt said. “It serves the purpose of making engineering more obvious to the rest of the community. Withouther support, I don’t know that it would have happened.” i V For students like Robert Ying, SEAS ’l6 andia Spectator editorial board member, another key initiative Boyce led was r the creation of the Makerspace, 650 square feet of open lab space students can access to pursue independent research and projects. V “It’s very hard to make a value judgement that says, ‘ls it worth losing a classroom in exchange for having another open lab for students?’ But she made that value judgment, and I think it’s the right one,” Ying said. _“I haven’t seen the classr room crunch getting worse, and in exchange we have a space A that’s open on students’ sched- . ule. It’s had pretty much constant usage.” V . Ying also cited the Extreme ' Engineering series as an exV ample of Boyce’s work to bring engineering to the forefront of the university. The lecture _ series, which kicked off this September,.has brought NASA s engineers and arctic explorers to campus with the goal of exposing students to exciting and radical jobs irrengineering. »“It ‘Wasn’t just. engineering students——peopleicame because it was cool,” Ying said. “That’s the kind of thing that - excites people and I think that has helped, because engineering has often been forgotten on campus,” E T ‘ Professor of. profession- ' al practice in the mechanical engineering department and former astronaut. Mike Massimino, who has helped to lead Extreme Engineering, said that Boyce’s vision for the series mirrors her passion for engineering and ‘her larger vision for the school. a E “I think she has thisvision "" that engineering is supposed ‘ to be fun, it's supposed to be exciting,” ‘Massimino said.

They are arranged to enable students to hear their music assignments played through a loudspeaker, thus saving time and energy. Previously, only small vietrolas with earphones were available in Butler Library, but the listening room was unable to accommodate the flow of students just before exams. These machines are still in use but the cancelling of 78 rpm record production will probably necessitate the installation of LP Mr. Beeson pointed out that the optional sessions cut down financial expenses because records are played less frequently and to larger audiences. Alexander Ringer, who is working on his Ph.D. in Music, takes charge of the listening hours. He answers any questions that may come up, but does not give any lectures. The sessions are very informal and many students bringing their lunches, Mr. Beeson said. Attendance at two of them every week completes homework requirements. The one disadvantage to the new program is that classes which meet later in the week hear the selections that have already been discussed by classes"

182,Music Humanities,The Way to Make a 'Whole Man' Versatile Individual College’s Aim,15 March 1957,"Versatile Individual College’s AimBy Robert BurdThe living heart of an educational institution is its curriculum. A university must stand or fall on its curricular program. While the Columbia College program of studies seeks to develop a well-rounded ""whole man"" it also aims at producing an individual who is trained for a specific field of interest. In the first two undergraduate years the student acquires a 'broad general education which will lay the ground work for his upper college years, and more importantly will present a picture of man's development—his achievements and his foibles. The core of the general education program are the Contemporary Civilization and Humanities courses. The student also broadens his horizons by taking two years of science and a foreign language. After an educational experience which stresses a great deal of factual information, the freshman is suddenly thrust into a world of concepts, and after a short time he thrives on them. Contemporary Civilization is aptly described as ""a study of the major political, economic and philosophic influences that have shaped the character of Western Civilization.""Through source readings the student is confronted with the major ideas of Western man— concepts from which modern society has sprung. Great thinkers who formerly wee only names —Aristotle, Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Marx, Hegel, Voltaire, Locke—■ now materialize and their thoughts provide a stimulus which challenges and excites thethirsty minds of Columbia College students. Major movements in man's dynamic history are illustrated by a study of these ideas which ultimately were the prime movers in the evolution of the modern world. The second year of Contemporary Civilization concentrates on man in his contemporary setting. Twentieth century man, often aconfused creature, is analyzed ■ and dissected in readings f by such renowned social scientists as John Dewey and Sigmund Freud. The two-year humanities sequence tells man's story through his art, literature, philosophy and music. Humanities A is an exhilirating course in which the student is taken on a grand tour of the classics of world literature and philosophy. Complete works by Eomer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, yirgij, Plato, Dante, Rabelais, Shakespeare and others, are studied with a view.toward helping the student develop taste and judgment through penetrating classroom discussion of the works read. e humanities course not only introduces the student to much that is new but also sheds new .illumination on such familiar works as ""The Iliad"" and ""Hamlet."" Inherent in the aim of Humanities is the desire to sweep away misconceptions and cliches about the famous books. 1 <]Tns ""whole man,"" however, is tiot complete until he has been exposed to the masterpieces of -fine arts and music, which constitute the second year of the humanities sequence. Towards Appreciation These courses give the student tools with which he is able to analyze, and ultimately to appreciate—for what appreciation can come without understanding? This sequence of core courses quite often proves a determining .factor in a student's choice of a major field of concentration. They lay the foundation and form the stepping stones to a more specific knowledge of a particular subject. The Columbia man, having acquired his general education, which also includes physical education, English composition and health education then goes on for study in his field of concentration. The diversity of the courses seems overwhelming to the student who first scans the catalog, which contains rare treasures culled from approximately 41 departments in the College alone. F:r those students with a flair ifor the more exotic, there are .opportunities to take courses in almost all of the graduate schools -,of -the university and in the School of General Studies. Language scholars have . a heyday Columbia offers more •languages than any university <In the country. Those interested can take courses ranging from jnodern European through ancient Greek to obscure African. The College has instituted a majoring system to make sure th£: the student graduates with knowledge of a specific field. A major constitutes 24 points in one field with 12 points of study in ■ a related field. .Dilettantes need not worry, however, for there is a great deal of room outside the major to take other courses. For instance, many students take such additional subjects as Oriental humanities and contemporary civilization, or the famed colloquium, which is a two-year study of great literary works from the ancient world and the modern.

185,Music Humanities,WKCR AM Pomposity,19 February 1963,"AM PomposityBy Jonathan SteinWKCR, the voice of Columbia, has an AM division which is based on a joke. The joke simply states that people are listening to WKCR's AM programs. Except for a few football and basketball games WKCR-AM exists only as a training ground for the FM division and as the center ring in a broadcasting circus. WKCR-AM begins broadcasting- at 5 p.m. and cutis at midnight. A recent innovation has been Reveille, which brings on chirping broadcasters for those unlucky lew trying to roll out of bed for nine o'clock classes. Its other shows consist of Campus C'! issroom, this term featuring Columbia's stars of stage and screen, Professors Shenton and Rothschild, and various disc jockey shows which feature ""raunch"" music. One reason for AM's demise has been technical. The flourescent lighting in New Hall and the old dorms, and the absence of a transmitter in Furnald decrease the potential AM audience. Also, the glamor and prestige of FM broadcasting has made AM broadcasting a. stepping stone to greener pastures. AM was an important voice on campus before FM made its debut. With the current situation, AM might not exist in a few years. Imaginative programming could solve many problems of AM broadcasting. One possibility could be the expansion of the Listening Hour programs during finals week, which are organized cram sessions for tone deaf Music Humanities students. This type of program could be valuable to students if it were given every day. The program could be authorized by the music department, which could suggest recordings. Also, poetry readings could be given by students. Interviews with professors or other personalities of interest to students could be offered. Many listeners would tune in the AM station if broadcasting continued after midnight. The station did run WNCN-FM music in former times. Even this easy way of programming for late hours is not being used. The station can save its pompous voice for its FM audience, but it should not delegate all its resources to its city-wide audience to the detriment of the campus one."
186,Music Humanities,Letter to the Editor,21 February 1963,"To the Editor: May I thank you for Mr. Stein's article on WKCRAM. We are always glad to see someone taking an interest in our work, even if ""almost nobody listens."" Almost all of the particular points he makes are either false or distorted, because his facts are completely wrong. Rather than presenting pre-digested views, WKCR tries to present as many diverse views as possible. We feel that our listeners are mature enough to draw their own conclusions from the correct facts. As for the fact that no one listens to us, let me point out that our advertising schedule has increased over 25% in the last year. National advertisers do not buy time or space in a communications medium that does not reach the audience. Local advertisers will not continue to buy time on a station without concrete results in the till. True, our signal does suffer slight interference in New Hall, but many residents have been able to get perfect reception by simply changing the position of their radios. Furnald Hall has presented some very knotty technical problems which have now been overcome, and the new transmitter will be installed by the end of the month. Mr. Stein's suggestions regarding our programming are rendered totally ineffective by his lack of information, or the paucity of research he put into his column. Our music humanities review is 10 hours long, repeated for an entire week, rather than an hour-long' cram session. These programs, and the practice exams are compiled with the help of members of the music department. Regular shows are often pre-empted for special campus features, such as Campus Press Conference, and campus documentaries. Professors Shenton and Rothschild are the featured lecturers on this semester's Classroom, although we have presented the classes of Eric Bentley, Richard Neustadt, and Henry Steele Commager in the recent past. These ""stars of stage and screen"" are some of the most respected educators in the nation. As you also know, even if Mr. Stein doesn't, AM and FM are two separate operations with separate staffs and programming policies. AM is a service for the campus community, bringing it entertainment programs, personalities, and features that it can't get on other radio stations. AM, thus, must be something other than a ""training ground for the FM."" Since we do reach an audience of diverse testes, our music programs are also varied. From live folksongs, to classical music, to rock 'n roll, which, by the way, comprises less than 10% of AM air time, WKCR tries to please and entertain the majority of our listeners. As for the pomposity of FM, may I simply cite a recent statement made about WKOR-FM by Newton Minow, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. ""I'm delighted to see this enterprise on the part of college students in running a radio station. I hope that others will use radio as you are to inform, educate and elevate, and to educate yourselves at the same time."" Jay S. Bulmash '63 President Feb. 20, 1963"
187,Music Humanities,Mimeographed Collection College to Prepare Own Text For Music Humanities Course,12 March 1963,"College to Prepare Own Text For Music Humanities CourseBy Stanford N. SesserA mimeographed collection of source readings now being prepared by the College Music Department will serve next year as the basic text for Music Humanities C1123.Course Chairman Jack Beeson, associate professor of music, says the collected readings along with departmental outlines of each musical period may eventually be published in book form. Readings in the Humanities course are presently assigned from three books of musical history. According to Instructor of Music Peter Westergaard, the Department is ""not satisfied with the readings as they now stand."" Professor Beeson says that several publishers offering to publish a general elementary text have already approached the Department. But Mr. Beeson states that the new collected readings will be designed specifically for the Columbia Humanities course. A need for periodic revision of the course readings and outlines to suit the course's needs may preclude publication in book form' Professor Beeson believes. The Music Humanities course has been gradually revised during the past few years. Mr. Beeson says that no one textbook has been used exclusively because ""the author's point of view will show through, and class time will have to be taken for arguments."" Several course changes have been announced in the music department for next year. MacDowell Professor of Music Douglas S. Moore will teach Heritage of Music (V 1009). The course has not been offered for the past two years. Music of the World's Peoples (V 1007) will be taught next fall by Adjunct Professor of Music Henry Cowell. The course surveys Near and Far Eastern music. A new course on Bach will be taught by Professor Paul HenryLang. The course will be open to college upperclassmen. In the absence of Professor William J. Mitchell, who will be on leave for the spring semester, Mr. Westergaard will teach Advanced Harmony (V 3333).Prof. Jack Beeson"
188,Music Humanities,Humanities Review,13 January 1964,WKCR 590 Kcs.-AM will present its semi-annual Music Humanities Review this week between 6 p.m. and midnight Monday through Thursday. Listening facilities will be provided in Ferris Booth Hall.
189,Music Humanities,Livelier Arts,12 February 1964,"The Humanities B courses—art and music —may seem very different in content from Humanities A. Yet in the view of the Stern Committee, similar principles underlie similar recommendations. The principles are that more intellectual precision and discipline are needed, and that ""models of discourse"" are desirable. The principal suggestion is for more and better readings. We think both the principles and recommendations are sound, even more clearly so than in Humanities A. Art and music, after all, are ""foreign languages"" to many students. Without a rigorous approach, involving the development of a scholarly and critical attitude, they tend to remain so. ""The student,"" as the Stern Committee says, ""must be given sufficient guidance so that he can move towards a disciplined vision of a work of art."" In the case of both the art and music courses, the committee has concluded, and the staffs have agreed, that superior readings would enhance the understanding of the works studied and also of the principles embodied in them. In each case, it was also found that no existing book could properly perform these functions. For art humanities, the staff will develop a volume with essays that illuminate historical and cultural contexts, and also serve as models of analysis. In music, an analagous collection of readings will be created. As in Humanities A, there is always the possibility that the student will copy his model of discourse rather than learn from it. In Humanities B, however, the risks are small compared with the potential gain. Too many students have no idea at all of how to respond to or understand a work of art. Better readings can help the instructor give them that knowledge. One other recommendation, with regard to art humanities, strikes us as particularly good. It asks that guided visits to museums be an integral part of the course. With New York's abundant artistic resources, it has always seemed strange that discussion between teacher and student should take place only in front of slides of varying quality. The music humanities staff might also consider further ways of exploring New York's artistic resources. The rich program of concerts in the city, in particular, might be used more extensively. The acceptance of the proposals on Humanities B by the respective staffs is promising. The Stern Committee's recommendations will help improve two courses that are worthwhile in their purposes, but could be better in some of their practices. (This editorial is the last of three on the report of the Dean's Committee on the Humanities Courses in Columbia College.)"
190,Music Humanities,Humanities B Staffs Study New Readings Committee Calls Present Materials Inadequate,20 April 1964,"Committee Calls Present Materials InadequateBy Michael T. GenglerThe staffs of Music and Fine Arts Humanities are currently collecting materials for new second-year humanities textbooks, in line with the recent recommendations of the special committee on the humanities courses chaired by Professor of History Fritz Stern. The present reading assignments were found inadequate by the Stern Committee, which suggested that each staff ""collect and commission"" a collection of readings for its course. The recommendations of the Stern Committee on Humanities B were referred ""with favor"" to the staffs in December by the Committee on Instruction. Professor of Art History Everard M. Upjohn, chairman of Art Humanities, said last week that a committee had been appointed ""to collect what material may be appropriate"" for a course textbook. The committee is headed by Saul Levine, an instructor in art history. Professor Upjohn termed the committee's task ""a very longrange undertaking."" He added that the staff has no immediate intention of changing the readings now offered until the committee has finished its work. The chairman of Music Humanities, Associate Professor of Music Jack Beeson, said that the staff had begun talking about a new selection of readings for its course last year, before the Stern Committee had presented its recommendations. He hoped that the new readings would be ready in .mimeographed form for use next year. The readings will consist of composers' letters and essays, as well as critical reviews from various historical periods. Professor Beeson said that the Music Humanities course was being reorganized to give instructors the opportunity to be ""more specific"" in their, discussions of the music. Listening periods will be used for the uninterrupted playing of music. Instructors will discuss overall features of style or organization of specific pieces as theychoose in class. Professor Beeson hoped that there would be ""a minimal concern with background materials"" in regular class hours. The readings will give students a historical background — ""what people have thought about music"" —Professor Beeson said. The Stern Committee made several other recommendations concerning the Art Humanities course. It questioned whether the chronological approach now used was the best/way to conduct the course. Professor Upjohn said that new iristructors are now encouraged to follow the order of the syllabus, which is chronologically arranged,but that as instructors gain experience, they are free to vary this approach. Another recommendation of the committee suggested that supple-mentary classes be scheduled in late afternoons and used for guided museum visits; Professor Up John said that Art Humanities instructors are already expected to conduct at least one such visit each term, and preferably two."
191,Music Humanities,New Readings For Hum. B Are Delayed,14 October 1964,"By Stephen SteinerNew readings for the art and music humanities courses probably will not be ready before next fall, according to representatives of both departments. Associate Professor of Music Jack Beeson, who had predicted last spring that the new readings for music humanities might be ready this fall, said that there is only a slight chance they will be ready in time for the spring term. A member of the committee working on the revision of the art readings, Instructor T. Christopher Carney, said that the revised list might be ready for use this spring or next fall. Last year a committee chaired by Professor of History Fritz Stern suggested that the courses could be ""greatly improved by the introduction of more penetrating and informal readings."" According to Professor Beeson, his department had already started a program to improve the readings before the results of the Stern Committee's deliberations were announced. The readings are to be predominantly letters of composers, and reviews dealing with compositions and performances of the past. The book would not be a textbook, according to Professor Beeson. ""This book would be a reading aid to the course—which is music,"" he commented. Professor of Art History Everard M. Upjohn, the departmental representative, noted that changes hadbeen made in the art.course only last year when Emile Male's book, the Gothic Image, and , Robert Branner's Gothic Architecture were added. As a result of the Stern report, though, ""a committee was appointed to discuss a project with the knowledge that it was to be of very long range."""
192,Music Humanities,BETTER THAN EVER New CC-A Notes,6 January 1965,"New CC-A NotesBv Dan CarlinskyFor some time now a local student-operated radio station has been programming semi-annual reviews of the College's Music Humanities course to help those students who may have missed a class or two—or perhaps didn't do one of the readings. But what about the poor freshman who is struggling with ""Contemporary Civilization CllOlxC1102y: Development of western institutions and social ideas?"" To be sure, the tweedy Board of Managers does arrange for faculty lectures on topics from CC, but this is not sufficient. There is still too much' material to be digested; someone must tell the student what to learn. Even the ponies, the freshman finds, are loaded with irrelevant material. Below is the first published attempt at a review of Monarch Press. The student is reminded that this digest is not intended as a substitute for doing the actual readings. It is suggested that this list be read over immediately before the final examination. It contains key words and phrases which will give you enough matter to fill three bluebooks. Then, after you've cleaned up, you can begin to write your exam. H ; * ❖ ARISTOTLE: Philosopher. CICERO: Right reason. MOSES MAIMONIDES: ""May his bones be ground to dust.""

193,Music Humanities,Bell Would Favor Pilot Student Unit To Initiate Plans Proposals to Be Subject To Faculty Discussion,1 March 1966,"Proposals to Be Subject To Faculty DiscussionBy Alan S. LakeProfessor of Sociology Daniel Bell declared yesterday that b» would like to see an experimental group of students follow the cui> | riculum outlined in his report o» | general education at Columbia. Professor Bell hopes such A pilot gioup would be the first step ia implementing the sweeping program proposed in the report. No specific plans for such a group have been formulated, however. According to Dean David B. Truman, the report is not intended as a ""blueprint for adoption <rt rejection, but a basis for discussion."" Dean Truman termed the BeH ! study a ""means of stimulating de» I bate"" within the faculty. ""Conflicts and compromises will be open,"" the Dean declared. ""Our objective is to get full and delibej> ate study."" Professor Bell stated that he e*. pects more support for his proposal to establish a third tier of general education courses than fav such curriculum revisions as out* ' lined for contemporary civilization and humanities. He noted that there arc more ""vested interests"" in those areas. Although acknowledging that his proposals would entail staffing problems, Professor Bell was unable to provide specific figures of the faculty requirements which would have to be met to put such programs into operation. He declared that controversy and debate arising from his proposals would in themselves be ""8 great plus, regardless of whetheß anything comes of this."" ""If a place is intellectually exciting, people will want to come,""* Professor Bell maintained. According to the curriculum proposed in the Bell report, an entering freshman would take a required one term CC course in Greek and Roman history. He would then have an option of following one of three ""tracks."" economic, socialintellectual, or political, during thenext two terms of the sequence. The report also calls for a year of humanities, with somewhatmodified readings, a new mathscience requirement, the extension of art and music humanities to a full year each, and the introduction of a ""third tier"" of general education courses in the senior year."
194,Music Humanities,Art Humanities to Drop Department-Wide Finals,14 December 1966,"Final examinantions drawn up by individual professors will replace departmental teste in Art Humanities this semester for the first time, according to Professor of Art History George R. Collins. These will be the firsit non-de-partmental finals to be given in any Humanities course, Professor Collins said yesterday. Music Humanities and freshman Humanities will continue to administer departmental itests. Professor Coillins noted that the individual exams are on an experimental basis, and faculty and student reaction will determine whether they are continued."
195,Music Humanities,Music Hum. Plans Advanced Section,21 December 1967,"The music department intends to conduct at least one section of music humanities exclusively for those students who are able to read music and who have some knowledge of music history and theory, Professor Jack Beeson said yesterday. During registration for the fall semester a sign will be posted in the music department office advising qualified students to register for section three, which will meet Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at eleven a.m. The advanced section will cover essentially the same curriculum as the other sections, Prof. Beeson said, except that the instructor will be able to cover more material or go into the regular subject matter in greater depth. ""But it will be pretty much up to the instructor,"" he said."
196,Music Humanities,Music Dept. Not Interested In Listening Room Disarray,13 March 1968,"Scratched and dusty records cover the tables and record players, earphones are strewn around the room, and two of the ten turntables in the College Library's music listening room do not work at all. Responsibility for the conditiorr of the listening room is denied by both the University Libraries and. the music department, and no plans for improvement of the facilities have been made. According to one librarian, the listening room is completely independent of the College Library. It is located there solely as a convenience to students in the music humanities course who use it instead of facilities of the Music Library in Dodge Hall, she said yesterday. The music department, however, is notified periodically of the state of the room. Peter Mozey of the music department, who is responsible for keeping the equipment in good re-. pair, denied yesterday that his department is responsible for thegeneral condition of the room. He . said that they are fulfilling their obligation by keeping the equipment operable. ""All the machines were serviced in January,' he explained. The state of ,the records and of the room itself is the result of student carelessness, he continued. The listening room has been more or less in complete disorder since the equipment was installed ""five or ten years ago,' according to Mr. Mozey. Mr. Mozey pointed to lack of supervision as the cause of the disarray. —C.Q.NOBODY CARES: The music listening room in the College library sits in a constantly disheveled state. Both the library staff and the music department disavow any responsibility for its upkeep and blame its disrepair on student carelessness."
197,Music Humanities,Faculty Troubled by SDS Action,27 February 1969,"By ROBERT B. STULBERGMembers of Students for a Democratic Society took their cause to the classrooms yesterday and many faculty members whose courses were interrupted by the students last night expressed indignation at the incidents. Robert A. Laudicina, assistant dean for student affairs, yesterday stated that about ten professors complained to the Dean's office about the interruptionsand said that many faculty members offered the ' administration names of suspected disrupters. According to Dean Laudicina, several professors havealsoasked the University to provide special security for classroom buildings today. Nearly forty classes in six campus buildings were interrupted yesterday when SDS members,seeking support for a planned demonstration today, entered classrooms to make announcements and distribute leaflets calling for an end to NROTC, military research, and armed forces recruiting. In an interview last night William Martin, a lecturer in sociology whose class was briefly interrupted yesterday, stated that he may ask the College administration to issue a public statement declaring that similar class interruptions ""will not be tolerated* in the future. He said he might also press-disciplinary complaints against the students involved in the action. ""I will take some kind of action,"" Mr. Martin said, - ""I believe this has to be stopped."" ""These actions strike right at the heart of the University,"" he said. ""If a student doesn't believe in consecutive rational discourse, he has no place at all here."" Roland E. Wulbert, an instructor in sociology whose class was also interrupted, yesterday differed with his colleague's view of the matter.""It would be quite another matter if it would go on over a long ; period of time repeatedly,"" Mr. Wulbert said. ""But I'm not particularly upset."" The sociology instructor remarked that he could not be particularly troubled by yesterday's action in part because ""some of the best students I've had all year"" participated 'in the interruptions. Associate Professor of Music Gordon F. Crain, who walked out of his music humanities class and alerted his departmental office yesterday when three SDS members entered his room, last night, scored the student interruptions. ""I don't really know what they were doing,"" he commented. ""But you just don't walk into anybody's class and —without explanation or permission—take over. It was just simply bad manners."" ""If it happens again, I will make a scene,"" he said, ""I'll throw them out if necessary."" 'ProfessoW German Ludwig W. Kahn, however, had a different view of the SDS action. ""I thought it was funny,"" he said. ""It was, nothing to get excited about.""UP IN ARMS: Students at a lecture razz SDS members who interrupted the session to announce plans for a protest."
198,Music Humanities,Music Humanities Faculty Approves Pass-Fail Grading,14 March 1969,"By JURIS KAZAThe Music Humanities teaching staff has approved a proposal by the College Committee on Instruction to adopt pass-fail grading in its Humanities B courses next semester, Joel Newman, associate professor of music, said yesterday. According to Vice Dean Thomas S. Colahan, now that the humanities instructors have adopted the suggestion of the Committee on Instruction, the matter will be referred back to the committee for final approval. ""The committee is taking the initiative,"" Dean Colahan said yesterday, ""to put to the test the 'mystical quality' ascribed to pass-fail grading."" Robert Branner, chairman of the department of art history and archaeology, said yesterday that he felt ""pass-fail can be tried in Art Humanities courses next year on an experimental basis."" Professor Newman also said that students in all fourteen Music Humanities sections are being polled on the adoption of pass-fail grading for the current semester. He added that a ""plurality of Music Humanities instructors agreed 'to present the student poll to the Committee on Instruction."" According to Dean Colahan, the Committee's proposal called for giving pass-fail grades ""in the usual manner, with the registrar converting letter grades into a P or F on the student's record."" Dean Colahan termed the Committee's proposal ""a meaningful experiment with a large population"" . He said that individual classes requesting pass-fail grading ""wouldn't prove a damn thing"" be-; cause of the small number of students involved. Recently the teaching staff of English A rejected aproposalfrom . the Committee on Instruction to place half of all freshman composition classes on pass-fail grading this semester."
199,Music Humanities,Pass-Fail Proposed For Freshmen,10 April 1969,"By MARTIN FLUMENBAUMThe College English department has recommended that next year all students enrolled in the three required freshman-year courses—Humanities A, English composition, and Contemporary Civilizations—receive a grade of either pass or fail. The proposed one-year grading experiment is currently being considered by the Committee on Instruction, the College's elevenmember academic decisionmaking body which must approve all curricula and grading changes for the College. Assistant Professor of English Frederick D. Grab, a member of the committee, stated last night that the proposal will most likely be ""revised"" and made more comprehensive. He indicated that Dean Carl F. Hovde will release a state-ment-tomorrow or Monday concerning pass-fail grading experiments for next fall. Barring opposition from indi-vidual departments several.other freshman courses, in addition to those suggested by the English department, may be graded passfail, another member of the committee said last night. He added, however, that the Committee on Instruction will probably not recommend a pass-fail system for all freshman courses. Associate Professor of Chemistry Nicholas J. Turro, also amember of the committee, said that the purpose of a one-year experiment would be to ""get more feedback"" about pass-fail grading. He stated that although the Committee on Instruction recently allowed music humanities to institute pass-fail grading,passfail experiments ""should not be done piecemeal.* ""We need a philosophical basis for a pass-fail system,"" Professor Turro said. ""If this experiment works then we can decide to go on. Right now there is very little evidence on passfaU grading."" Last semester the Committee on Instruction rejected two faculty requests—one by English Instructor Steven Marx, the other by Associate Professor of Philosophy Robert Paul Wolff— for pass-fail grading reform. At that time the committee argued that any. change in grading policy, even its own proposal, would have to be approved by the entire College faculty.Nicholas J. Turro"
200,Music Humanities,Hovde to Release Pass-Fail Plan For Basic Freshman Courses,14 April 1969,"By MARTIN FLUMENBAUMThe College Committee on Instruction has recommended that students enrolled in almost all of the required degree courses next year receive a grade of either pass or fail. The proposal, if approved by the College faculty later this month, would place virtually the entire freshman year on a mandatory pass-fail basis. In a statement prepared for release today, Dean Carl F. Hovde said that the plan combines ""thepossible virtues of the pass-fail system"" with the committee's conviction ""that students must be carefully evaluated by their teachers."" The' one-year pass-fail plan would include the three basic freshman year courses —Humanities A, English composition and Contemporary Civilization A—as well as all introductory language courses, art humanities, and music humanities. In addition, the committee re-commended that five year-long ""poet's"" sciences coursesastronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics—be included in the grading experiment. Any two of these five courses can fulfill the current math-science requirement. The entire experimental plan is subject to review after one year. The eleven-man committee also suggested three alternatives for evaluating student performance in the mandatory pass-fail course. First, instructors could indicate the performance of any student working below C level at midterms. A second option would be to submit letter grades at the end of each semester to the Dean's Office, with the understanding that they would not appear on the student's permanent record. Third, for those faculty members who think that even unrecorded grading impedes proper learning, the committee proposed that instructors complete questionnaires at the end of the semester evaluating their students. The questionnaire could rate each student on his class attendance; the amount of readingcompieted before class discussions; overall command and control of the materials and techniques of the course; written performance in class; and participation in class discussion. A typical set of evaluations used on the committee's sample questionnaire listed the following gradations in performance: ""suberb, fine, solid, adequate, and inadequate."" The instructor is also asked to evaluate term papers and judge the student's ability to ""make testable formulations"" and ""marshal an argument."" The instructor can also recommend a student for academic awards, tutoring, or even psychiatric help. Dean Hovde stated that there are two major reasons why the committee's proposal focuses on the freshman year. ""Students entering selective colleges have for many years been under pressure to collect as many good grades as possible,"" the Dean said. ""It may prove to be true that a first year without publicly recorded fi-experiment primarily because letter grades in the courses were thought necessary for medical and graduate school applications.^, The Committee on Instruction is the College's academic de-cision-making body, and must approve all curricular and grading reforms. A faculty smoker will .be held April 21-to discuss the proposal. Later this month the College faculty will meet to make a final decision. Under the College's current pass-fail option, instituted in September 1967, a student may register for pass-fail credit for only one non-required course per semester. If the proposal is approved by the faculty, however, freshmen or sophomores who take mandatory pass-fail courses will not be permitted to use the regular passfail option. At the request of the Human •Development staff, the Committee "" on Instruction also recommended that all courses in that department be graded on a pass-fail b,asis.nal grades will make students more comfortable without reducing the will to work."" He also remarked that ""passfail entries for the first year will not prejudice our students in their applications to graduate school."" The proposal omits introductory science courses required for majors in chemistry, psychology, mathematics and physics. These were excluded from the pass-fail•/-'. The following is the text of Dean Hovde 's announcement: The College Committee on Instruction is putting forth for consideration by faculty and students a proposal which, if approved for trial, would put the freshman year substantially on a pass-fail basis. We have spent many hours talking about the various suggestions which have been made about the grading system, and while doing so we have on principle denied individual requests for exceptions to ten present letter-grade system. To have done otherwise would have been to change by special precedent a system established by the faculty long ago, and in a matter where there are strong arguments for common practice and control. In making this proposal we have tried to balance twothings--on the one hand, the possible virtues of the pass-fail system and, on the other, our firm conviction that students must be carefully evaluated by their teachers-no change in grading can be permitted to diminish this. The proposal focuses on the freshman year for, several reasons. Students entering selective colleges have for many years been under pressure to collect as many good grades as possible, and it may prove to be true that a first year without publicly recorded final grades will make students more comfortable without reducing the will to work. It is to be noted that our plan assures just as much information as we now have about performance for Columbia's own purposes-the only change is that the final grades would not be recorded on the transcript. That we suggest this for freshman courses does not indicate any feeling that these courses are ""less important"" than more advanced work; but we feel, among other things, that pass-fail entries for the first year will not prejudice our students in their applications to graduate schools, which are primarily concerned with upper-college performance, particularly in the major. It was for a similar reason that we omitted the introductory science courses which are important public evidence for students who. are applying to some graduate programs, medical school being an example. We propose this plan for trial in the coming academic year.II 111 Ml ■■ I 111 I I 1 EEM^^^m^— A Note to Some Skeptical Readers Who Thought Friday's Spectator Was an April Fool's Issue Once a year reporters on Spectator prove to themselves that the events in the so-called real world which they cover are not so different from complete fiction.

201,Music Humanities,Faculty May Reject Pass-Fail Plan,12 May 1969,"By MARTIN FLUMENBAUMThe College faculty will probably reject the passfail proposal for basic liberal arts courses approved last month by the Committee on Instruction, Dean Carl F. Ilovde predicted last week. ""My suspicion is that it will be voted down,"" he stated. According to the Dean, ""the majority feeling"" at an informal faculty smoker last Tuesday was against the pass-fail proposal. The faculty is scheduled to vote on the plan May 19. II the plan is endorsed, students next year will receive grades of either ""pass"" or ""fail"" in Humanizes A, first-year Contemporary Civilizations, English composition, introductory language courses, art humanities, music humanities, and five ""poet's"" science courses. The entire experiment would be subject to review after one year. Dean Ilovde also stated that the proposal suggested by Professor of English Quentin Anderson for a single ten-point course for freshmen met only scattered opposition at the smoker and has a ""good chance"" of being approved at the official faculty meeting next week. The ten-point course, which was recently approved by the Committee on Instruction, would replace CCA, Humanities and English composition for 150 freshmen next year. The pass-fail proposal would place virtually the entire freshman year on a mandatory pass-fail basis. Dean Ilovde said that ""almost every conceivable objection was raised"" to the grading change.Vice Dean Thomas S. Colahan remarked that at the smoker the Committee on Instruction ""came out looking like a bunch of radicals."" ""There was considerable opposition to the Anderson proposal from the younger faculty,"" Dean Colahan stated. ""On the question of pass-fail, everyone was pushing their own plans."" The Anderson proposal has been strongly criticized by the College Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee, which contends that the Anderson plan lacks ""breadth"" and would be ""demoralizing"" to freshmen who-lose interest in the selected topic. The student group has suggested an alternative plan which would eliminate English compostion and substitute in its place a course modeled on English 1003, involving intensive examination of a single work or author. In addition, the committee's proposal would enable freshmen to take any one of the three major required courses as a seminar."
202,Music Humanities,Faculty Turns Down Pass-Fail Proposal,3 June 1969,"The College faculty voted by a narrow margin on May 21 to reject the pass-fail proposal for the basic liberal arts courses approved by the Committee on Instruction in April. Only sixty of the three hundred eligible voting members of the faculty attended the meeting. The proposal would have placed virtually the entire freshman year on'a mandatory pass-fail basis. The one-year plan would have included the three basic first year courses—Humanities A, English composition, and Contemporary Civilization A—as well as all introductory language courses, art humanities, music humanities, and five one-year ""poet's"" science courses. Next year, under a restricted pilot program approved by the faculty, students enrolled in music humanities, art humanities, and human development will receive pass-fail grades. The proposal suggested by Professor of English Quentin Anderson for a single ten-point course for freshmen to replace CCA, Humanities, and English composition was tabled by the faculty after attendance at the meeting decreased to the point where a voting quorum was not available. On the first ballot of the pass-fail vote, the proposal passed by a slim two-vote margin, 2S-2€. When a recount was requested the proposal was then defeated by a 32-28 vote. Dean Carl F. Hovde, one of the major supporters of the pass-fail plan, expressed disappointment Friday over the poor attendance at the meeting. He stated that he plans to set up a faculty committee to review the general education curriculum in the College early next semester. Dean Hovde indicated that a ""reexamination"" of all required courses, the science requirement, and the second year Contemporary Civilization courses was needed."
203,Music Humanities,At Ungano's B. B. King,13 October 1969,"B. B. KingBy JOHN T. McGRAEJ\s I entered, I dug someone I knew and the cat said, ""Man, I've never seen so many white people diggin' a black thing."" The rows were filled from the first to the last. Glassfuls of spirit rushed to astro-bodies thirsting for the experience. Couples, predominantly white, snapped and swayed to the thing their fathers had tried to bury in the mud. Strange, how they seemed to worship it openly now. The blues had gone through a lot of changes. I smiled when I saw the few blacks that were there diggin' it all, free from discomfort. The air trembled among us when B. B. King announced the performance of ""Sweet Black Angel,"" a song he didn't +ave the courage to sing in the past. The trance was complete, and I knew the act was still alive as I watched B. B. and six ebony bodies sweating in the spotlight give birth to the blues. 1 HIS is B. B.'s secret charm as he disclosed his life to me that evening. There is a cry in the music of every man who lives, who plays what he lives. After years of reading articles of various white, self-appointed authorities on black people's music, one sees that the demise of the blues that is often insisted upon becomes as absurb as the monotony of its repetition. Black people are alive. They have survived the flood, the great whitewash. The attempt to direct them to a cliff's edge has failed and the black man has the knowledge that he is alive, that he doesn't need a ""change of mind"" or change of heart or change of lifestyle. Thus, black music has survived the cold, unfriendly stares, the whispered talk of past prejudices that labeled jazz (blues) as the music of oversexed monkeys. B. B. King survived, and his music has survived the outrageous arrows of the ""fortunate"" -- white Stan Getzs, Frank Sinatras, Elvis Presleys who are indebted forever to the slave who spared them from centuries of the minuet. Black music is the essence of America's cotton-wrapped gift to the cultural world, even though the credit is given to those Sinatras and even though Music Humanities skips over B. B. King. JL>. B. KING, a Mississippian, is a black man who has gone through the experience of black men: that of being conceived in the chains of ghetto, surrounded by everything and accessible to nothing; that of 300 nights of work for the past 20 years, only to see Elvis Presly make it in cut time. No wonder he's in tune with ""the revolution,"" no wonder he speaks with the tongues of Leroi Jones, ""avante-garde, antijazz"" Coltrane and James Brown. Black music is just beginning to realize how beatiful it is, that is is not inferior to Beethoven, at the same time that black people are still contemplating their own beauty as a people. ""Sweet Black Angels"" is in, and black music has taken on an introspective aspect within the last ten years. 1T is growing conceptually, for it not only expresses sadness or sad joy but every possible experience; it is growing in the sense that it takes pride in its appearance. Funky no longer stinks, is no longer self-conscious. Funky and bluesy have taken on a positive quality relative to the black's positive view of himself as an agent to things beautiful. Thus, B. B.'s blues, the music of the black artist, functions organically on two levels other than that of entertainment. The first reflects the spirit of a people, of a group's experience, while the other expresses one's own experiences in sight, sound and thought. Thus, the music of B. B. King is enjoyable, reflecting the emotional and spiritual black joy, the positiveness of' ""Black is beautiful"" at the same time it is personally introspective, a human experience multidimensional, seemingly fragmented but actually rooted in the kaleidoscope of self. I \jN the personal level B. B. King is lyrical, yet in a turbulent way. He has a lyricism that can be exceptionally sensitive to nuances of mood and color, but is based on the strength and openness of feeling which allows that lyricism to pass through a wide range of transformations. His band is reactionary and revolutionary. The three ancient chords wear new apparel every time one digs a solo. This is what allows black music to be relevant to the times at all times: the fact that it has an improvisational clause while the basic structure can remain the age of Africa. This improvisational quality, once a unique quality of F-ast-ern music, allows the artist B. B. to express hisVirgo nature, his experiences as an airplane pilot, his lifetime of struggle and his present aspirations. Thus, 8.8. is reactionary and revolutionary --as reactionary and perhaps as revolutionary as Coltrane who revived ancient cosmis music, as reactionary and as revolutionary as black people who are looking forward to* the pride and freedom of the distant past. ""Sweet Black Angel* is just a taste of that race dream, that human dream, and the future is more than the free future we all envision. Somehow, we remember being there before. But what of the white people who ride waves of chord changes that flow from the guitar ""Lucille""? What about the white colleges and organizations that appreciate B. B. King as ""King of the Blues""? What about them?. They not only prove the universality of the music and that it is beautiful to more than one people, but also that music which is beautiful and natural cannot be held back. It must overcome) and those who tried to bury it in the mud must be humble be-"" fore it once they have failed. B. B. King who sings ""Sweet Black Angel"" is in tune with all other artists in ""the music"" including Archie Shepp whose ""fire music"" blazed trails into the forest of self, landmarking each part of us as beautiful. B. B. King sings with strength,the strength of unity, the unity of people, the unity of ""the music"" that in past times spoke not always of black pride but always at least in terms of this natural phenomenon called Blackness,"
204,Music Humanities,Art Faculty Gives Pass-Fail a ‘Pass’,18 February 1970,"By ELIZABETH WEINERAfter one-semester, the pass-fail grading experiment in art humanities has received qualified approval from the majority of art history instructors. At an informal meeting yesterday, the instructors laced approval for the flexibility of passfail with suggestions for modifying and refining the new system. A one-year experiment in pass-fail was instituted this fall in art and music humanities under the supervision of the College Committee on Instruction. The committee specified that each instructor must assign the same number of exams and papers as were used previously to determine letter grades. The committee has not yet met with humanities instructors to discuss response to the pass-fail system, although a formal evaluation is planned in the future. According to David Rosand, associate professor of art history, and departmental representative, many instructors feel that pass-fail allows much greater freedom for both teachers and students, while alleviating the pressure on students for high grades. Professor of Art History Howard McP. Davis said he has found his ""students more productive, class discussions freer."" Professor Rosand remarked that students in his section ""gave of themselves freely, while I felt free for the first time to stray from the syllabus."" Others claimed that pass-fail was ""the only equitable grading system for required courses,"" particularly where many students have no background in the discipline. Eugene Santomasso, instructor in art history, said he kept personal records of achievement, and ""found them more useful to students than •grades."" The major criticisms voiced by the instructors concern the rate of attendance and amount of effort expended by students in the course. Average daily attendance in art humanities sec-tions dropped from 450 last year to 250 this semester. Some teachers feared that students assured of a passing grade felt no compulsion to attend classes. Although Professor Rosand detected a ""slackening off of work and attendance,"" he noted that the ""quality of many papers was high."" Another instructor, Ann Farkas, found that assignments were passed in promptly, and that the exams were unusually well-at-tended. Only one or two students failed art humanities last semester, but Professor Rosand said this was due ""as much to the traditional reluc-: tance of teachers to give failinggrades in required courses as to the nature of the pass-fail system."" Only one professor expressed unequivocal disapproval of the pass-fail experiment. Professor Everard Upjohn, who is on leave this semester and did not attend yesterday's meeting said last week ""I do not think that pass-fail grading is at all desirable."" Several recommendations for modifying the pass-fail system were advanced by the art humanities faculty yesterday. Mr. Santomasso suggested that a letter grade option should be available to those students who need grades for graduate school admissions. Other instructors proposed refinement ofthe pass grade to indicate extra effort. Les Lepow, '71, editor of the Columbia-Barnard Course Guide, attended yesterday's meeting to present an overview of student reactions to the pass-fail experiment in art history. Lepow told the faculty group that only two students, out of 200 who returned course evaluation questionnaires for the humanities course, expressed disapproval of the passfail system. ""The vast majority praised pass-fail for removing academic pressures,"" Lepow explained, ""and only ""a few students admitted that they had expended less energy in the course.*Howard McP. Davis"
205,Music Humanities,"B. A. Requirements May Be Lowered Educational Panel Calls For Changes In CCB, Humanities, Sciences",28 April 1970,"Educational Panel Calls For Changes In CCB, Humanities, SciencesBy JON GRONERThe College Committee on Educational Policy is expected to recommend to the College faculty that the math-science requirement be reduced to one year of natural science, that Contemporary Civilization B be replaced by a distributional requirement, and that students be allowed to substitute a literature course for art and music humanities. The committee will vote tonight on the plan, which was proposed by Assistant Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman. Robert Belknap, professor of Russian and chairman of the panel, predicted last night that the group's recommendations have ""a very good chance"" of being approved by the faculty at its meeting next month.Assistant Professor of Greek and Latin Seth Schein, another member of the sixteen-man group, last night indicated that the Holtzman plan ""represents more or less what the committee will finally recommend."" He said, however , that the group may make minor changes in the proposal at tonight's meeting. According to Professor Schein, the main question that is yet to be decided is the status of mathema-' tics and foreign languages. The Holtzman proposal recommends that students be required to take a* year of either math or language, but some members of the committee oppose this provision, feeling that students should be required to fulfill a year of both subjects. The current science requirement can be satisfied with either two years of mathematics or a natural science. Under the committee's recommendations, only a year of natural science would qualify. If the proposal is adopted, math could be used in place of language. The panel will also recommend that any full-year course in the social sciences, including history, should satisfy the second-year CCB distributional requirement.Most members of the group feel that the current CCB courses are not fulfilling the function of general education courses. The committee consulted with the art and music departments before considering making art and music humanities optional. According to Professor Scheih, the panel was satisfied that ""fewer but better students"" would register for the courses if they were not required. Dr. Belknap said last night that one reason thatthegroup's recommendations are likely to be approved by the faculty is that the group has ""a lot of political power."" ""There's almost nobody who can say there's no one on this committee he can't really trust,"" Professor Belknap said. The Holtzmanplanis understood to represent a compromise between committee members such as Dr. Belknap, who wanted to retain the current number of required courses and those who wished to do away with all requirements. The group decided several weeks ago to recommend that freshmen have the option of taking a ten-point course to fulfill their general education requirement or a six-point course which would replace English A and either CCA or Humanities A.Eric Holtzman"
206,Music Humanities,Panel Asks Distributional Program,29 April 1970,"The College Committee on Educational Policy last night, in a surprise move, voted to recommend to the College faculty that students be required to take at least four semester courses ""in fields remote from their major;"" that either art or music humanities — but not both—be required; that the Contemporary Civilization B requirement be abolished; and that the math-science requirement be reduced to one year of natural science. The four-semester distributional requirement would be the first such program in the College. Under its provisions, for example, science students would have to take four courses of their choice in non-science fields. History majors would have to take four courses outside the social sciences. The group's final decision differed in several respects from the original plan introduced at the meeting by Assistant Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman. TheHoltzman plan had provided for a mandatory year of either language or mathematics, while the version approved by the sixteen-man panel maintained the current language requirement and did not include any requirements which could be fulfilled by mathematics courses,except the tour-semester distributional requirement. The Holtzman plan had allowed literature courses to satisfy the Humanities B. requirement. Under the present plan, only art or music will now do so. Furthermore, the Holtzman plan had provided a two-semester distribution requirement in social science. The committee's proposal states that social science can be used only as an optional way of fulfilling the four semesters outside the major. Robert Belknap, professor of Russian and chairman of the panel, said last night that he expects a final copy of the group's recommendations to appear late this week or early next week. The plan will go before the Col- j lege faculty at its meeting in mid•May and, according to Professor , Belknap, it will be extensively dis-.; cussed beforehand with students i and faculty members. Members of the committee have j indicated that the plan stands a 'good cnance of passage by the faculty. Professor Belknap said last night that the committee had decided at the meeting to require either music or art humanities because of a ""dread of some people's grim determination to restrict themselves to their field."" The chairman indicated that agreement had been reached among nearly all committee members on the proposals ""I can't imagine unanimity among them, but there was apretty heavy consensus,"" he said. The chairman noted that if the proposal were approved,the College requirements beyond the freshman year would be quite similar to those at Barnard. He said this is ""a slight step"" toward cooperation between the two schools. The committee, which will meet four more times this year, is expected to deal with other problems such as the staffing of College courses. ,"
207,Music Humanities,Leab Will Present Proposal For Revision of Curriculum,24 September 1970,"By JON GRONERAssociate Dean for Academic Affairs Daniel J. Leab has composed a new proposal for academic reform in the College and will present it to the faculty early next mpnth. The plan, which Dean Leab yesterday termed ""more structured"" than the recommendations of the Committee on Educational Policy, may be offered as a substitute for the latter proposal. The dean's plan would involve the following innovations: reducing the math-science requirement to two semesters, substituting a seminar for freshman English, requiring two semesters of a social science in place of CCB, requiring two semestersin ""formal and analytical thought,"" and providing greater opportunity for interdepartmental majors and student-ini-tiated courses. The plans, however, would retain the existing requirements in CCA, Humanities A, and art and music humanities. The Committee on Educational Policy, chaired by Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap, last spring recommended major liberalizations in these required courses. The recommendations of the Belknap committee have encountered criticism from several faculty members, and Dean Leab said that his proposal is partially designed to meet some of that criticism. The faculty is scheduled to meet at a still undetermined date in early October to resume its consideration of the Belk-nap committee's recommendations. In an interview yesterday Dean Leab said that his plan is based on the idea that ""there is such a thing as liberal arts and there is still a role for general education."" The dean explained that the proposed new requirement in ""formal and analytical thought,"" which would be satisfied by any introductory course in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy, is designed to ""teach students how to think."" Several faculty members contacted yesterday indicated that heated debate is likely at the meeting, and that the Belknap committee's recommendations will probably not be approve d without modification. Some provisions of the Belknap plan, however, such as abolishing CCB and reducing the science requirement to one year, are considered to have a very good chance of passage. Dean Leab said that he was hopeful that his plan will be substituted for the Belknap plan, and indicated that it is also possible that still other proposals will be debated by the faculty.A member of the Belknap committee yesterday stated that the panel had not met this year and that its future is in doubt since five of its members are either on leave or no longer at Columbia. Several faculty members also indicated that Dean Hovde might appoint another committee to examine the College curriculum.Daniel J. Leab"
208,Music Humanities,Education Committee Reaffirms Proposals,13 October 1970,"By JON GRONERIn its last scheduled meeting before the faculty convenes October 22, the College Committee on Educational Policy last night reaffirmed the proposals for curriculum reform which the body offered to the faculty last spring. The panel, however, also decided not to present a nine-page preamble to the faculty along with its recommendations. After several members objected to parts of the preamble, the committee agreed that the statement would be presented only as the personal opinion of the chairman, Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap. Several members of the committee last night expressed uncertainty on the proposal's chance of passage next week. They stated that faculty members have not yet had a chance to consider the plan in depth. The report, which was originally drafted last spring, proposes a ten-point course replacing CCA, Humanities A, and English A and a six-point course replacing eitherEnglish A and either Humanities A or CCA, as options for freshmen. It also proposes that only one year in the sciences be required, that either art or music humanities, but not both, be required, and that a three-semester distributional requirement be initiated. The only member dissenting from the substantive proposals of the panel was Assistant Professor of Greek and Latin Seth Schein. Professor Schein, who will explain the reasons for hisdissenttodayin a letter to the faculty, could not be reached last night for comment. Before the report of the Belknap committee is presented to the fa-culty October 22, it will go before the Committee on Instruction Wednesday, where it may face stiff opposition. It is understood, however, that the plan will be submitted to the faculty even if it does not meet with the approval of that panel. The preamble which was not accepted by the panel last night is a broad discussion of problems involving general education, pre-ceptors and other non-tenured faculty, and the major system. Several members of the committee criticized it for allegedly belittling the abilities of College students and for an alleged lack of sufficient concern for the rights of junior faculty members. Members of the committee indicated last night that they felt the preamble required ""some minor editing"" but that it was too late to edit it according to their wishes. Therefore it was decided to dissociate the committee from the preamble. It is understood that many faculty members favor several of the Belknap committee's recommendations, especially the reduction of the science requirement and the elimination of CCB as it now exists. The plan to establish a ten-point seminar, however, has encountered criticism from some faculty members who are concerned that freshmen electing the course will be ""locked in* if they find the seminar they are taking uninteresting. Some faculty members alsofear that the standard Humanities and CC courses will lose much popularity if the new course is initiated. Some members of the Belknap panel last night expressed reservations about the effectiveness of their proposal, even if it passes the faculty. ""The chances that it will pass are fair,"" Assistant Professor of Biology Eric Holtzman stated, ""but the chances that it will accomplish anything are dubious."" Dr. Holtzman cited budgetary pressures necessitated by the university's financial squeeze as obstacles to real academic change in the College. In addition to the Belknap report, the faculty will consider an alternative plan written by Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Daniel J. Leab and a plan to make the major requirement optional, written by Professor of Psychology Eugene Galanter. The Belknap committee was appointed by Dean Hovde last December.Robert L. Belknap"
209,Music Humanities,Schein Dissents From Report Of Curriculum Committee,14 October 1970,"Seth Schein, assistant professor of Greek and Latin yesterday dissented from the recommendations of the College Committee on Educational Policy and called for the extension of the pass-fail option to all courses and the extension of the degree program to six years rather than the current four. Professor Schein focused his criticism of the panel's report, which will be voted on bytheComm ittee on Instruction this afternoon and by the faculty next week, on its provisions for the freshman year. He said that the proposed optional ten-point freshman course ""would present great budgetary and staffing problems"" and ""would drastically narrow rather than expand a freshman's intellectual horizons."" He also said that to merge English A with Humanities A or CCA for some freshmen would be ""merely transferring its blight to two courses which are now relatively healthy—an undesirable transfer."" Professor Schein, the only regular member of the panel to dissent, did endorse several of the group's other proposals: reducing the math-science requirement to one year, requiring only onesemester in either art or music humanities, and instituting a three semester distributional requirement. ""The present burden of requirements is so alienating to so many students that these changes are highly desirable,"" he stated. The classics professor emphasized however, that he does not favor ""standing pat, which seems to me the dismal intent and effect of the plan Dean Leab has circulated."" Dean Leab's plan, which will also be discussed by the Committee on Instruction today, retains, according to Professor Schein, most of the features of the current College curriculum. ""Our committee has not dealt with certain matters which seem to me far more important than curricular tinkering, if we are to reduce somewhat the widespread disaffection among Columbia College students toward their academic work and thus improve our educational policy,"" Professor Schein concluded. In addition to Professor Schein, Dean Leab, who is ex-officio secretary of the academic panel, also dissented from the group's recommendation."
210,Music Humanities,On Academics II,21 October 1970,"The main goal of any academic reform proposal for the upper college, the sophomore through senior years, should be to minimize course requirements, yet maintain some structure of general education. In order to achieve an equilibrium between these two ends, the first and obvious step would be to approve the Galanter plan and make requirements for the major or concentrate optional. The second step towards requirement reduction necessitates a careful reevaluation of the current number of mandatory courses. Upperclassmen must now take two"" terms of second-year Contemporary Civilization, music humanities, art humanities, two years of mathematics or natural science, and must prove command of a foreign language, a knowledge equivalent to four or more semesters. This set of requirements is blatantly prohibitive. It forbids the exercise of individual choice in the selection of courses, and often forces a student into disciplines in which he has neither interest nor motivation. The plan submitted to the College faculty by Professor of Russian Robert Belknap makes an attempt to drastically reduce these requirements. He has recommended that CCB be dropped; that either music humanities or art humanities, but not both, be required; and that the science requirement be reduced to two terms. According to his plan, the language requirement would remain as is and College upperclassmen would be asked to take at least three terms of subjects ""remote from their major."" Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Daniel Leab, in his counter-proposal, called for two terms of social science; two terms of natural science, at: least one term being a laboratory course; two terms in formal and analytic thought; music humanities and art humanities; and a reading competence in a foreign language to be demonstrated by the end of the sophomore year. Neither plan is flawless, and both assume the continuation of the archaic major system. Assuming that the Galanter plan can be enacted, it appears that a mixture of both the Belknap and Leab proposals would best serve the interests of the students and the faculty. First of all, the natural science requirement must be reduced to two terms. Both reform plans agree on this principle, yet neither offer what should be the obvious corollary: all the poets' science courses should be abolished. It makes little sense to require •courses that are intellectually unsound and academically not rigorous. They should be abolished. Professor Belknap's recommendation that either art or music humanities be required appears to make sense. This change would lower the number of required courses and still make it possible for students to voluntarily elect to take both. The idea of two semesters in formal and analytic thought appears quite sound and innovative. This requirement should be met by specific courses in mathematics, philosophy and linguistics. And finally CCB. Yesterday I centered my criticism of the freshman year proposals on the weaknesses of CCA. Today, I center my complaints of the Leab and Belknap plans on the strengths of CCB. Both plans effectively call for the abolition of specific CCB courses, courses which in the past have proven intellectually stimulating and uniformly excellent. Some of the best offerings in the College, such as Professor Fritz Stern's European Modern History course, currently fulfill the CCB requirement. If the requirement must be tampered with at all, what should be done is to extend the number of courses meeting the requirement. Dropping CCB will be detrimental. The faculty when it meets tomorrow must consider all the pros and cons on the issue of academic reform. The most important duty for them, however, is not to quibble or harangue, but simply to act. The current system in the College is in need of immediate revision. — MARTIN FLUMENBAUM"
211,Music Humanities,"College Faculty Meets Today, May Cut Science Requirement",16 November 1970,"By JON GRONERThe College faculty will vote today on a proposal to reduce the two-year science requirement to one year. Prospects appear favorable for passage of the plan. At a special meeting held Friday, the College Committee on Instruction recommended that the faculty approve reducing the mathscience . requirement to two onesemester courses. Should the faculty pass the proposal, the Committee will decide which courses would fulfill the requirement from suggestions by the science departments. The reduction of the science requirement is the most signifi-cant of the Committee on Educational Policy's curriculum recommendations, which the faculty is scheduled to consider when it meets in the Faculty Room of Low Library at 3 p.m. Otherproposals of the policy committee on the faculty's agenda include requiring either art or music humanities, hut not both; abolishing the CCB requirement; and initiating a three-semester distribution requirement. In addition, the faculty will discuss a proposal by the policy committee to set up two new interdepartmental staffs, composed largely of junior faculty members. These new units would be a joint Humanities-CC staff and one composed of elementary science instructors. Professor of Russian Robert Belknap, who chaired the policy group, said Friday that the chances are ""very good"" that the faculty will reduce the science requirement. The proposal does not specify whether the cut would be retroactive to students now in the College or whether it would take effect with the class of 1975. In addition to the Belknap recommendations, the faculty may also consider an alternative curriculum reform plan proposed by members of the Committee on Instruction. This alternative, while reducing the science - requirement, would continue to require both art and music humanities. In addition, the plan would institute only a two-semester distributional requirement in social science. It is not considered likely that any change will be made in the art or music humanities requirements. David Rosand, associateprofessor of art history, is expected to introduce an amendment retaining these two courses as requirements, and this is expected to be adopted. The faculty may also consider a proposal originally made last May by Professor of Psychology Eugene Galanter, which would abolish the major as a degree requirement. Although this plan has significant support, it is not thought to command a majority. At its last meeting, the faculty voted to reject sections of the Belknap plan calling for ten-point and six-point courses for freshmen. It did vote to abolish the current two-semester freshman English course and replace it with a one-semester writing course focussed on a literary work. The faculty postponed until today the consideration of the rest of the Belknap proposals. Professor Belknap Friday characterized the reduction of the curricular rereduction of the math-science requirement as the most significant of the curricular reforms yet to be debated. Abolishing the CCB requirement, he indicated, is a relatively minor change since a decision last spring to broaden it considerably means that it is essentially a distributional requirement already. The science requirement, often satisfied by ""poets'"" courses, haslong been considered a burden by humanities students. Its curtailment would reflect: the feeling among many faculty members that the science courses for non-sci-entists are ineffective and that the requirement is more trouble to students and instructors than its educational worth"
212,Music Humanities,2-Year Requirement In Science Reduced Art and Music Humanities Retained: Faculty Turnout Is Extremely Low,19 November 1970,"Art and Music Humanities Retained: Faculty Turnout Is Extremely LowBy LINDA WEINSTEINrum, also failed to discuss Professor of Psychology Eugene Galanter's plan to make the major requirement optional for College students. The new one-year science re-? quirement will include only those courses in the natural sciences which the Committee on Instruction designates in the next few weeks. Thus, mathematics will definitely not fulfill the requirement in the future, and it is possible that other sciences will also not be approved by the instructional panel. The reduction is, however, retroactive; students now in the College who have taken one year of any approved science course will have fulfilled the new requirement. Students now enrolled in the College will also continue to have the option of fulfilling the old twoyear mathematics-science requirement. The reduction of the science requirement was prompted by the desire of many faculty members to make the program more con-The College faculty Monday voted to reduce the science requirement from two years to one, but decided to retain both art and music humanities as required courses. In the second faculty meeting of the year called to discuss the recommendations of the College Committee on Educational Policy, the faculty did not take action on the panel's proposals to institute a distributional requirement and to make major administrative reforms in the staffing of general education courses. The meeting, which attracted only 66 professors, six more than the twenty per cent required for a quo-centrated and rigorous. Several professors expressed the opinion that the current ""poets'"" science courses are not academically sound. Dean Hovde introduced the resolution which the faculty approved as a substitute for a provision of the policy committee, chaired by Professor of Russian Robert L. Belknap. Both plans provided for the reduction of the science requirement, but Dean Hovde's motion specified that the Committee on Instruction would approve science courses to fulfill the requirement. There was little opposition to the resolution, which passed 37-16, with eleven abstentions. Discussing the decision to retain both the art and music requirements, Richard Friedberg, associate professor of physics and a i member of the Belknap committee, said that while he generally favored reducing degree requirements, he ""could see the 1 arguments"" for keeping these courses mandatory.The faculty also decided to require that students demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language by the end of the sophomore year, rather than at the end of the senior year as is currently required. Dean Hovde explained at the meeting that the decision was prompted by the general CoUege policy of having students finish their requirements before the junior year. By the time that the faculty was to vote on the distributional requirement proposed by the policy committee to replace the second year of Contemporary Civilization, there was no longer a quorum. The faculty, therefore, was forced to postpone consideration of this proposal to yet a third meeting later in the semester. No date has been set. Professor Galanter, who proposed the optional major last month, was not present at the meeting. He had requested that his proposal be tabled and discussed by the Committee on Instruction in the coming months.Richard Friedberg"
213,Music Humanities,Humanities May Abolish Pass-Fail,4 February 1971,"By GAIL ROBINSONArt and music humanities courses, which have been graded passfail for the past two years, may return to the traditional letter grade system next year. The humanities faculties have asked that letter grades be restored and it is expected that the Committee on Instruction will debate the proposal in the near future. The entire faculty must then approve it for the plan to take effect. Associate Professor of Art History David Rosand said yesterday that pass-fail was introduced as an experiment last year and that the instructors have ""had their highest hopes disappointed."" David Josephson, instructor of music, asserted yesterday that ""the majority of instructors are quite unhappy with pass-fail as it stands."" Professor Rosand said that last year the experiment was thought to be a success because it provided teachers with more freedom and placed less pressure on the student. This year, he explained, ""attendance has dropped tremendously"" and, because of the pass-fail system, humanities is ""the course that most students sacrifice."" He added that unless passfail ""is extended across the board, I don't think it makes much sense."" Professor Rosand had no explanation for why attendance had dropped off so sharply this year except that it may be due to ""the style of the semester and may apply to other courses as well."" He said that in an art humanities class of twenty-five students attendance would average only between 13 and 15, and added that the quality of' work has also declined.* Mr. Josephson asserted, ""I'm unhappy because the marking system seems to discourage serious attitudes."" ""There has been no opportunity to award any mark for distinction,"" and he further asserted that he would favor either a letter grade system or a pass with honors — pass—fail system. Professor Rosand claimed, however, that once the letter system is installed ""you're back to a grading system and you might as well admit it."" He said that he didn't see thatthe Committee on Instruction has any real alternative to approving the proposal because ""the staff feels so strongly about it."" Professor Rosand expressed hope that the faculty would also approve it and that there would be substantial debate."
214,Music Humanities,Faculty Approves Resolution For Interdepartmental Staffs,5 February 1971,"By FRED SCHNEIDERDespite the lack of a quorum, the College faculty yesterday approved the creation of interdepartmental staffs for Oriental Civilization and Freshman English sem-' inars. It also called on the College administration to seek budgetary control of all joint staffs, including the Contemporary Civilization A and Humanities A staffs. These recommendations were the final proposals of the Committee on Educational Policy to the faculty. The panel's report was originally submitted at a meeting last May. In addition, the faculty called on the Dean's office and the science departments to develop an interdepartmental staff for science courses that fulfill the one-year science requirement. The policy committee had recommended the creation of a science staff. However, the facultysuggested that this matter be handled by the Dean. Rules of the College faculty stipulate that 63 members, twenty per cent of its membership, are needed to constitute a quorum. The faculty, however, approved the resolution submitted by the committee by a vote of 32-6. Because no member objected to the vote despite the lack of a quorum, the vote was ruled legal. The faculty decided to submit another proposal of the Committee on Educational Policy to the interdepartmental staffs. This recommendation asks staff chairmen to select certain graduate students as interdepartmental preceptors. Interdepartmental preceptors would be graduate students who only teach in interdepartmental staffs. Since they would not be responsible to any department, they would be committed entirely to general education. Professors of Psychology John Nevin and Eugene Galanter agreed to table their motion calling for the abolition, of major and concentration requirements.Professor of Russian Robert A. Belknap, chairman of the Committee on Educational Policy, told the faculty that the proposals of his_ group had indicated its desire ""to further the move towards general education in the College."" The panel, now dissolved, had proposed six and ten point seminars for freshmen, the reduction of the math-science requirement to a one year science requirement, the substitution of distributional requirements for the second year of Contemporary Civilization, and the reduction of the second year of humanities to one semester of either art or music humanities. Professor Belknap added that the actions of the faculty in continuing to require Humanities A, CCA, and both music and art humanities, showed that body's commitment to the liberal arts tradition. He called on the faculty to fulfill this commitment by approving the resolution to create the Oriental Studies and freshman English seminar staffs. This proposal also allowed them to secure senior faculty members rather than any junior faculty or graduate students a department could spare. After the meeting, Professor Belknap explained that due to the passage of his committee's proposal, the Oriental Studies program, whcih currently draws instructors from the departments of East Asian languages and cultures, history, international affairs, Middle East languages and cultures, and religion, would be strengthened by its independence from the contributing departments and by the budgetary pressure the College administration would be able to exert. Dean Hovde commented on the meeting's lack of a quorum, noting that the Committee on Instruction had discussed the necessity of changing the faculty rules which govern the meetings and which specify the qualifications of a mem-ber of the College faculty. He also announced that the Dean's office would probably be able to exceed the ten per cent administrative cost cut-back called for in a directive from President McGill.Robert Belknap"
215,Music Humanities,Floors: 'A Sense of Community',10 May 1971,"By J. MICHAEL MARIONWhat happens in those plain old everyday non-exclusionary, noncontroversial floor lounges? What goes on in these bastions of Columbia's Great Silent Majority when Joe doesn't have a date again and it's Saturday night and he doesn't feel like doing his Music Humanities paper? ""Besides playing cards, smoking dope, watching television and drinking hootch, there's not too much to do in the lounges,"" Ron Nudelman '71 remarked this weekend. Watching television provides a convenient excuse for wasting time. One is likely to find the same group of people in the lounge night after night watching the Mets or the Knicks and, following that, the late movie which somehow always seems to be about the evils of Nazi Germany. The lounges can often serve as a headquarters for activity and abasis for a ""feeling of community"" on a floor. On 3 Livingston (nee ""Utopia""), for example, it is a rare day when a crowd of ten or fifteen do not gather for three straight hours of bridge in the afternoon, a Ta-Kome hero dinner in early evening and a few quarts of Miller's for the rest of the night. But the floor lounge is only part of a greater whole: The Floor. The Floor is those people who join the intramural sports teams, those who leave their doors open and those who join in the all night football games held in the five foot wide corridors. The success of a ""Good Floor"" depends on two main forces. There must be one or two natural ""leaders."" These people generally are such big goof-offs that they spend all their time devising ways to compel the ""floor"" to goof-off creatively. An example of goofingoff creatively is the time when the seventh floor of Carman turned outall the lights on their floor, propped u bedspring up against the elevator, and scared the hell out of anyone stepping off the elevator. Of course, there are people who live on a floor but ar? not actually part of The Floor. These people are the ""Grubs"" or are just too antisocial to join in. Sometimes one finds an entire floor that consists of ""Grubs"" or that is anti-social. These floors have no ""feeling of community."" The second force that helps a floor to be a ""Good Floor"" is a ""Good Counselor."" His main job is to encourage interaction on the floors at the beginning of the year. He is rarely seen after the first two or three weeks of school. One might as well add another force that brings, or rather did bring, floors together. That force is ""Star Trek."" Until a couple months ago, lounges that were empty at 7:25 had at least twenty people at 7:30 to watch Mister Spock and Captain Kirk. ""Star Trek"" evenprompted one floor, 10 John Jay (without a doubt the freakiest floor on campus), to turn itself into the ""Star Ship Enterprise."" 10 JJ is an exact replica: ""life support systems"" (the lounge), ""red alert"" (the lire alarm) right down to the emergency oxygen tanks (fire extinguishers). You have to see it for yourself. Since ""Star Trek"" went off the air, many floors have returned to being anti-social or fragmented. Even 10 John Jay has given up being the Star Ship Enterprise and has degenerated into drawing flying phalluses on the wall. It is not unusual to see figures out of ""Zap Comix"" wandering around the walls in the dormitories. The preponderance of wall-drawings and colorful doors eliminates some of the dreariness one might experience in a dorm. The main thrust of floor graffiti is a very cynical view of life, Columbia, politics, sex and America. Theteeling that propels people to make fun of Spiro Agnew on hundreds of doors throughout the dormitories is the same feeling that prompted the now infamous T-shirts that have a cinder block inscribed with ""Carman in the City of New York"" on them. In the past few years, many improvements have been made, according to many upperclassmen who can remember the days when there were no carpets on the lloorway of the corridor and when three people occupied what is now a double while two people occupied what is now a single. Floor lounges did not even exist until recently. According to Steve Treadway, a law student who is going to be head resident of Livingston Hall next year, ""there are three things which have improved dormitory life: the physical restructuring—lounges, depopulation of rooms to relieve overcrowding, and, next year, coeducation."" Co-education in Livingston is one of the few successful projects UDC has carried out this year. Many people suspect UDC members of joining for ""Iheir own personal aggrandizement."" In the recent poll in Furnald on the gay lounge, when asked to comment, several residents expressed dissatisfaction with UDC. The comments ranged from ""smash UDC"" to ""why can't UDC do anything intelligent?"" One person stated that he thought UDC was ""one of those student governments that come every once and a while as a current student fad and then fades into oblivion with minimal effect."" So each floor lounge varies witheach floor, some are a joy and some are not. The TV watching, the dope smoking, the card playing and the hootch drinking are universal. In a way, the ethos is universal also: Life isn't artful, Larry dear. It's only lived. And because we ride subways We are often underground Like Alice We see White Rabbits Is it because we are so stoned? Or is Columbia a White Rabbit McGill eats rabbit shit But I bet he doesn't ride Subways, Larry dear —from a poem on a wall in 4 FurnaldAS THE WORLD TURNS: This dormitory resident gets a feeling of community in one of the several floor lounges provided for that purpose.LOUNGING: Another resident delights in a basic floor lounge practice, alone."
216,Music Humanities,Freshmen Face Eased Requirements,24 September 1971,"By LINDA WEINSTEINFreshmen entering Columbia College this year will face a considerably lightened sys-tem of requirements as a result of several changes voted in a series of faculty meetings last year. Although the curriculum revisions were not as sweeping as many faculty members would have liked, they still represented the most comprehensive revamping of the College general education system in many years. A one-semester introduction to literary study will be offered to the class of 1975 in lieu of the full year of English A which was previously required. The two year math-science requirement was reduced in November to a one-year course in the natural sciences. The Contemporary Civilization B requirement, in the social sciences, was changed, and now two semesters in areas remote from a student's major will be required instead. The College faculty voted to retain one semester each of art and music humanities on a pass-fail basis, rather than reduce the degree requirement to one semester of either art or musichumanities. Changes in the foreign language requirement Were also discussed but voted down by the College faculty. Students still must take four semesters of a language or demonstrate comparable proficiency. These changes grew out of a study by the Committee on Educational Policy made in the spring of 1970. The committee's recommendations were presented to the College faculty in May 1970 but discussion was tabled because of the Cambodian crisis. The more radical proposals of the committee, such as replacing all or part of the freshman year general education program with a six or ten-point seminar, were rejected. The Committee on Instruction criticized many of the group's recommendations and presented to the faculty alternative proposals for curriculum reform. With the exception of the CCB requirement, the recommendations of the Committee on Instrucion, rather than those of the Educational Policy Committee for requirement changes were adopted by the faculty. Dean Hovde puthorized last year the creation of a panel ""to assist the CCA staff in its efforts to improve the course and to deal more effectively with some of the staffing problems which have beset CC in recent years."" At the March faculty meeting a proposal for an optional major, made by Professors of Psychology Eugene Galanter and John Nevin, was rejected. By the end of the year, interest had shifted from the problems of academic reform to the strained relationship between the College and Barnard. Certain Barnard and Columbia departments, such as history and anthropology, cooperatively offer the same courses to students from both schools. Other departments at the two schools have completely separate course offerings, with little interchange of students. Barnard would like to maintain its own ideutity, faculty and students on a coordinate basis with the College. However, Dean Hovde and other members of theuniversity administration desire a complete academic merger. Before this can occur, several problems— the different degree requirements at the two schools, different wage scales for faculty members, different criteria and procedures in hiring faculty members— must be resolved. Last December, President McGill and Barnard President Martha Peterson approved the creation of a Joint Trustee Committee on Co-education. This committee, consisting of three trustees from each school, held open hearings on April 22 and May 12. It is scheduled to release its findings this fall. The College Committee on Instruction has already approved a statement asking that ""the agreement between Columbia University and Barnard be amended or abrogated"" so that the College can admit women. The panel presented this proposal to the faculty on May 17 but it was tabled until the second meeting of this year, on November 15. Many faculty members felt that acceptance of this statement would undermine the work of the Trustee Committee. President McGill has predicted amerger between the two schools within five years. „As a result of the February faculty meeting, at which there were only fifty-three faculty members, ten short of a quorum, the faculty voted to reduce the number of professors needed for a quorum from one-fifth of the total membership to fifty. The faculty rejected another proposal by the Committee on Instruction aimed at lowering the membership of the College faculty. The instructional panel recommended that voting privileges be denied to professors who miss three meetings in one year without an excuse. The College administration was reorganized for this year in order to increase efficiency and cut costs. A new position— that of associate dean— was created to replace the offices of associate dean for student affairs and associate dean for academic affairs. In May, Dean Hovde named Assistant Professor of Greek and Latin Peter Pouncey to the post. Henry Coleman, last year's Dean freshmen, was appointed to the newly reinstated position of Dean of Students.Martha PetersonCarl Hovde"
217,Music Humanities,Third Tier,29 October 1971,"At a recent interview, Dean Hovde expressed interest in an old idea for curricular reform which has has been ignored for some time: ""third tier"" general education courses. These courses, proposed several years ago in a report on the College curriculum by former Columbia professor Daniel Bell, would be interdisciplinary courses similar to the current Contemporary Civilization and Humanities courses but designed for the Upper College. Unlike CC and Humanities, they would not be required for the degree. They would merely be designed to enrich the College curriculum for students desiring courses which straddle departmental boundaries. Dean Hovde has not taken any steps since that interview to further the discussion of this idea. Since it is still merely a personal musing of the Dean and has never been officially discussed, it may soon be forgotten, as many intriguing ideas are, simply for lack of interest. The idea is nevertheless worth consideration. The audacious intellectual exploration that pervades some sections of CC and Humanities is a unique experience for many students; their up-per-level courses, restricted by departmental boundaries and specialized techniques, are often a considerable letdown. A third-tier course would likely attract the intellectually curious student and become a memorable experience for both students and teachers. These are, of course, only preliminary notes. The idea is in the very earliest stages, and serious consideration would reveal many difficulties, such as designing appropriate subject matter, obtaining qualified instructors with interest in teaching such a course, and combating the general lack of interest in expanding academic programs in the College. The name ""third tier"" has become misleading now that the ""second tier"" practically does not exist. The abolition of the second required year of CC and of science, as well as the de-emphasis of art and music humanities inherent in the pass-fail system, has meant that only the freshman year has a general curriculum for the College. The ""third tier"" course, whatever it may be called, should certainly not be a degree requirement. But it is worth more consideration than it has yet received, and the Dean should insure that this consideration begin soon."
218,Music Humanities,Critics Pan Sarris Film Course,18 November 1971,"By FRED SCHNEIDERAndrew Sarris looks more like the assistant principal of your high school than an associate professor of film. With his baggy suit, receding hairline, dissolute pouches under the eyes, and a tendency to insert ""urn's"" and ""you know's"" when he is searching for the proper word, Professor Sarris seems much less eminent than by all rights he should, since he is one of the most important and respected American film critics.Yet, despite his unprepossessing appearance, Professor Sarris teaches a course that for the past two years hasbeen easily the most popular one in the College. In fact, the course is so popular that the students registered have been issued identification cards to gain admission to the class. The class has been moved to McMillin Theatre in Dodge Hall to accomodate the throngs that used to gather in Harkness Academic Theatre last year. At that time, Professor Sarris would enter to tumultuous applause, and make witty pronouncements on movies and film history that would reduce the class to helpless laughter. But that is no longer the case. The highly-privileged, ID cardtoting students now have an entire balcony in addition to a large auditorium, in which they have enough room to lounge, with their feet on neighboring chairs, and to watch Professor Sarris' performance on the stage. And many people now feel that the switch to McMillan has adversely affected the course. Equipped with a throat microphone, Professor Sarris resembles Johnny Carson giving his monologue, as he shifts from foot to foot and continually alternates between gathering hismicrophone cord and shoving his fists into his pockets. Unfortunately, there is no sense of intimacy, since his voice comes blaring from four large speakers located at the front of the auditorium. Last year, Professor Sarris could reduce his audience to hysterics with a witty comment on Stanley Kramer's distorted world-view, or the observation that Jerry Lewis typifies Americans to the French. This year, however, his wit is lost in the roar of amplified sound, and his students barely snicker as they wait to view the film classic that follows his lecture. Professor Sarris himself complained about his role as a performer last week, commenting that he is ""wired for sound, while the students can't hear each other. ""Most intelligent and sensible people don't always speak out,"" he noted, adding that he was left to shout down the few souls who do ask questions and challenge his opinions. Unlike the well-structured course given for the past two years, this year's version of ""Wednesday Night at the Movies"" is a potpourri of filmdom's finest in which students don't know whether to expect a silent Russian film by Sergei Eisenstein or a nouvelle vague film by Jean-Luc Godard.""People would become very depressed by the number of silent films if I were to present the entire silent era,"" the film professor explained. As a result, the course, some students commented, appears disjointed and is very confusing to novices who cannot accurately follow the development of film-making and directing techniques. Many of the students in the course indicated that they had registered for it because they hoped to learn more about film and to take a course that they thought would not be academically rigorous. In fact, the grade for the semester is based-solely on one piece of work— a five-page essay on some aspect of film. Professor Sarris suggests that a report on a book about film or a movie review is acceptable. Most students choose to review a movie they've seen recently. ""I thought it would be an interesting gut,"" one student interviewed last night commented. ""Having taken art humanities and music humanities, it seemed natural to take a course on film. But ""I've found 'Wednesday Night at the Movies' very bcring,"" he added. ""I'd rather choose which movies to watch on Wednesday night by looking through TV Guide.""__Academic GourmetAndrew Sarris"
219,Music Humanities,Slowing Down,5 January 1972,"The pace of academic reform in the College, which just a year ago seemed to be picking up considerably, has now apparently slowed nearly to a halt. The Committee on Instruction, the major body which considers academic innovations, has done little recently but continue a rather petty controversy over the Contemporary Civilization A course, and has not been the source of any major impetus for curriculum re-evaluation or change. Like so many other processes in the university, academic reform has been repeatedly delayed and deferred. The issue has begun to recede from the public consciousness, and apathy towards educational issues has set in. Just over a year ago, the last of a series of faculty meetings completed action on the recommendations of the old Committee on Educational Policy, chaired by Professor Robert Belknap. While not as sweeping as it might have been, the curricular reforms of 1970-71 included such major steps as the transformation of freshman English and the reduction of the science requirement. The issue of requirements in general became the focus of discussion among students and faculty members. Although no drastic revolution was accomplished, at least the spirit of innovation was in the air. Now that spirit appears to be gone. The highly innovative ""institute"" taught last spring by Professor of Political Science Alan Westin has not been repeated this year, nor has any Other professor decided to employ the ""institute"" format in a course. The concept of pass-fail grading, instituted two years ago in art and music humanities courses, has not been extended; the whole subject of grading policies has not been an issue for some time. Requirements, reduced last year, have not received further attention. It is about time for the Committee on Instruction, as well as all interested students and professors, to begin anew the process of evaluation of the educational policies of the College. Unexamined traditions tend to gain unquestioned acceptance; inaction now may lead to complacency in the future. The uncertainty caused by Dean Hovde's announced intention to resign may, of course, distract attention from academic reform, and may lead many in the College to relegate the problem to the concerns of the new dean, whenever he is named. But it is clear that whoever the new dean will be, he will want to see signs of involvement by the Committee on Instruction and the College in general before he can take action on academic issues. Some serious discussion this spring lead to meaningful change next fall, when the College takes new directions under new leadership."
220,Music Humanities,Barnard Courses May Fulfill Some College Requirements,25 February 1972,"Gene Cornell '72, a member of the Joint Barnard-Columbia Committee on Instruction, last night predicted that students in the College will be allowed next year to use Barnard courses to fill their foreign language and science requirements. Cornell also said that Barnard courses might be accepted for the English seminar and art and music humanities requirements. He noted, however, that such specifically designed courses as Contemporary Civilization have no equivalents at Barnard, and thus must be taken at the College. Cornell, a student representative on the panel that was set up to consider the academic problems arising from co-education, indicated that he did not think that either school would change its general degree requirements. Cornell explained that the Joint Committee on Instruction was concerned that the flow of students between Barnard and the College be equally distributed. If College students were forced to take only College courses to satisfy their general education requirements, upsetting the flow of students, Barnard might not let College courses satisfy its distributional requirements. This situation would dilute co-education, Cornell said and added that the committee intends to ""minimize this unfortunate effect."" Cornell indicated that Barnard students would be allowed to take CC and humanities courses as electives, whether or not Barnard accepts them for its degree requirements. College students similarly would be allowed to elect any Barnard course. He stated that the College seemed prepared to offer more sections of CC and humanities, if needed, to ac-commodate Barnard women, and added that he assumed Barnard would be willing to pay for this. ""This is not the best of all possible proposals,"" the student representative remarked. He said that the problems presented by the differing degree requirements, arising from ""different conceptions of education,"" cannot be overcome. The Joint Committee on Instruction is now ""investigating the facts of the situation,"" Cornell indicated. He said that the panel is just starting to get down to specifics, and proposals will not be forthcoming for a while. Cornell concluded that ""while movement is most likely"" in areas involving non-specific course requirements, ""don't rule out the possibilities for movement elsewhere.""Photo by Peter Cuneo YESTERDAY IN JOHN JAY: Eugene Santomasso discusses a model playground designed by one of his students for Plaza Caribe.

221,Music Humanities,"Unit Would End Pass-Fail For Art, Music Humanities",26 March 1973,"By TOM SAWICKIThe College Committee on Instruction (COI) voted last week to recommend the elimination of mandatory ""pass-fail"" grades for art and music humanities courses, Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal, the chairman of the committee, announced yesterday. ""We saw no reason why one degree requirement course should be diffrent from another,"" Dean Rosenthal explained. ""The pass-fail system was not successful for good per-formance in the course,"" he added. Faculty reaction to the COI vote was mixed, but most professors who were contacted approved of the vote. Assistant Professor of Art History Eugene Santomasso, College departamental representative, explained yesterday that the . ""pass-fail system for the two courses was just an experiment, initiated after the spring of 1968, but ultimately it failed because art and music humanities were reduced to second class courses."" ""In the eyes of the students, our course was the one they wouldn't do any work for,"" Professor Santomasso said, adding that ""in the future we will have to try a number"" of things to make the course more rigorous, like a definite syllabus of readings, to help to give the course more structure."" Assistant Professor of Music Joel A. Sachs, commenting yesterday on the committee's action, said he was ""just about the only person who feels that the pass-fail system should be retained,"" and that the system ""was intellectually justifiable because students' reaction are more spontaneous when they feel no pressure in the course."" He added though that he had""very mixed feelings about a required course not being a grade course."" Assistant Professor of Art History Dustin H. Rice said he felt that ""the grades will add more discipline to the courses."" The pass-fail system for art and music humanities was instituted in the fall of 1969, as a three-years experiment. At that time many faculty members and students argued that having a less rigorous grading system for the courses would put less stress on the students and allow them to become more involved in the arts and music. Bill Sharp 73, College member of the COI, said yesterday that last year the committee discussed recommending an elimination of the system but that the proposal was never presented to the faculty for a vote. ""I think it should stay pass-fail and I don't think that the faculty will vote against it at its meeting Monday,"" Sharp stated.Assistant Professor of Music Piero E. Weiss said last night that ""originally"" he was ""against the idea of having a pass-fail system, because a year after the system was instituted the students bagun to cut classes and this was no way to learn anything."" ""I think that pass-fail should remain in the books but that the students should have an option of receiving grades,"" Professor Weiss commented. Professor of Music Howard S. Shanet echoed the opinions of his colleagues in both departments when he said that he was ""in favor of the garding system"" and that ""having a pass-fail system was not worth the trouble."" ""I'm more concerned in getting students interested in music and receiving some feedback,"" he said. Associate Professor of Art History William M. Hinkle stated he was ""in favor of grading because the quality of student work went down under the pass-fail system.""Michael RosenthalEugene Santomasso"
222,Music Humanities,Wrong Solution,26 March 1973,"In its decision to recommend that ""pass-fail"" grading in art and music humanities be eliminated, the College Committee on Instruction is proposing that an oppressive element of College curriculum be made more oppressive. The argument that students who do well in art and music humanities should not be penalized by being forced to take it ""pass-fail"" makes sense. Professor Piero Weiss's proposal that students who want to take a grade in the courses be allowed to do so is sound. Another, and more common argument for restorrestoring letter grades in art and music humanities is disturbing. Professors say that students do little work in these courses and seldom come to class: they attribute this to the compulsory ""pass-fail"" grade. Unfortunately, the COI evaded the issue and refused to examine the quality of art and music humanities classes or to consider the value of general education courses in these fields. Instead, the committee decided to attempt to force students to take an interest in the courses by eliminating the pass-fail option. Although this is likely to get students to work very hard, especially those who plan to go to professional or graduate schools, we believe that it undermines the basic purpose of general education in the fine arts. Certainly, more students will attend classes and do the work for a course in which they are graded, but so what? The point isjo make the courses interesting enough so students will want to learn about music and art, rather than be forced into it. We doubt that students who find their required art and music humanities course uninspiring will achieve enlightenment because they are threatened with low grades. It has been shown impossible to motivate students to take an interest in these courses because of the courses themselves: the required letter grade will only make uninterested students more unhappy, not more interested. And so the courses become a chore for all involved: because so many instructors are needed to teach the courses, several are assigned who would prefer to teach other courses, and those who enjoy teaching art and music humanities are faced with a largely apathetic and bored class. Students who want to take the course are penalized by the lack of interest of many of their peers and the resulting weariness of so many of the instructors. A brief introductory course in art and music is a necessary offering in the College—it would be far more successful, however, if it were not required. If all the students taking the course were genuinely interested in it and all the teachers happy to teach it, its quality would necessarily improve. We do not dispute the COl's realization that something must be done to improve the required art and music humanities courses. We believe, however, that requiring the letter grade only makes the course more disagreeable."
223,Music Humanities,"Pass-Fail Abolished In Two Humanities Letter Grades Required in Art, Music; College Faculty's Vote is Unanimous",27 March 1973,"Letter Grades Required in Art, Music; College Faculty's Vote is UnanimousBy RICHARD SLOVAKThe College Faculty voted unanimously yesterday to end pass-fail grading for art and music humanities courses. The vote followed brief statements, urging approval of the proposal, by Professor of Music Joel Newman and Dean Pouncey. There was no debate on the issue, which was voted on at the faculty meeting attended by over fifty faculty members. ; The faculty also voted formally, without debate or opposition, not to eliminate the grade of F. There were two abstentions. Last month, the faculty voted overwhelmingly to maintain the grade, but it was not a formal vote because there was not a quorum at the meeting. The vote to eliminate the pass-fail system for art and music humanities courses followed the recommendation ofthe College Committee on Instruction (COD last week to take such a course, by a vote of ten to two. Professor Newman, who introduced the motion yesterday, said at the faculty meeting that most members of the art and music departments are ""very, very much in favor of this idea."" ""It's to the students', best interest to make these courses just like our other courses,"" Professor Newman said, remarking that no other academic course in the university has a mandatory passfail grading system. He decried what he referred to as an ""abysmal"" attitude of students toward these required courses, and said that under the current system students are not even making aminimal effort to learn about art or music. Dean Pouncey mentioned the COI vote taken last week, pointing out that two other resolutions to alter the pass-fail system for these courses had been rejected. He said a resolution proposed by Assistant Professor of Music Piero E. Weiss that would preserve the pass-fail system but allow students the option of requesting grades, was approved by only two members of COI. Another resultion, to extend the current pass-fail option for one course per semester, to all required courses was defeated seven to four, according to Dean Pouncey. The COI decided if this measure were approved, required language and science courses ""would be singled out for these options and would therefore become secondclass courses,"" the dean said. In other action at the faculty meeting, Dean Pouncey announced that the College will begin using a recruitment film which presents ""a positive picture of New York City,"" in order to obtain admission applications from ""all the places we ought to be"" but aren't."
224,Music Humanities,Backward Step,27 March 1973,"The faculty's decision, made without debate and without a single dissenting voice, to return art and music humanities to regular grading—without the courses having been improved or modified in the slightest—was, in our opinion, an ill-considered and saddening step, both in itself and, far more important, as a proclamation of the new regressive, almost reactionary, stance of the faculty. Having rejected proposals to abolish the F grade, having delayed coeducation in many departments by requiring majors to take only College courses, and having agreed with proposals to automatically call police on campus in any case of ""interference,"" the faculty has now taken its first step toward actual revocation of positive progress made in the past. Is it overreacting to say one finds unanimous concurrence in regressive policies disturbing? The situation in the humanities courses needs little belaboring. In 1968, regular grading in the courses was discarded as unfair to those students without background, training and aptitude in the subject matters. Neither art nor music humanities have been radically altered since then, and thus are still unfair in exactly the same way. We personally favor for these courses a track system (a system of courses given at different levels of difficulty) combined with generous grading. Just as the science requirement is made bearable for students with poor scientific training and intuition by a track system, and just as the language requirement is made endurable for students lacking preparation by a system of levels and placement tests, so should art and music humanities be made safe for the philistine by offering him sections where he is judged only relative to other philistines. And just as students are often graded more lightly and given lighter material in poets' science courses than in heavier tracks, so must they be graded and taught tolerably here too. Our stand should not be misinterpreted to mean we favor abolition of required courses or loosening of academic standards. We believe that the general education courses are vital parts of a Columbia education, and that systems can be set up which will maintain academic excellence, and induce each student to sample the different intellectual areas, without compelling him to suffer, or to have his record mutilated, in.the attempt. But this is all an aside. If the humanities staff did not demand tighter discipline, the present system might well satisfy us. Other proposals , some possibly better than ours, others complementary to it, have been offered to the faculty, and the real question is, why the faculty did not consider any alternatives at all; why in its headlong rush back to the discredited 1968 standard, did it require of the humanities staff no commitment at all to make the course more palatable than in the past...? The question echoes a number of recent ones. Why did the faculty reject all variants of the proposal to change the F grade, that branding iron which over-punishes those students guilty of careless mistakes or doomed by professorial antipathy? Why were all suggestions to make it easier for students to work in the fall election quashed? And why has the faculty backed the naive and suicidal police-intervention proposal? Even more serious are the questions of those needed reforms which the faculty has rejected by its silence. Revision of Contemporary Civilization, increasing the amount of senior faculty instruction at the undergraduate level, standards of tenure including consideration of teaching efficiency, new teaching techniques, removal of the self-serving departmental roadblocks to coeducation- -with all these reforms to be considered and acted upon, why is the faculty preoccupying itself with educationally useless or even noxiously repressive changes? If the faculty thinks that by refusing needed new reforms or by revoking old ones, that it will pacify—pacify in the sense of quiet by pressure and punishmnt —the students, it is mistaken. Real reform in the university is necessary, even if not by itself sufficient, for good relations between students and faculty. And real reform, when tried, has worked. The reforms of three semesters ago: replacement of English Composition by Freshman Seminar, and shortening of the two-year science requirement, have been successful; even the calendar change, less a reform than a technical innovation, has probably proven successful enough to keep. It is the repeated and continued success of progressive steps that so clearly throws into relief the faculty's new stalling or back-stepping policy. The faculty has turned down several good proposals for reform, turned back the clock in other areas, and turned away— unanimously and without discussion —from progressiveness or even inquisitiveness. We urge it to consider the many and manifest reforms that need be made in the College—before its""gettough,"" repressive moves turn off its student support. — CHARLES TIEFER — JOHN T.LEWIS"
225,Music Humanities,Action on Grading Dismays Students,28 March 1973,"By TED GREENA majority of students questioned yesterday said they opposed the College faculty's decision to abolish pass-fail for art and music humanities. However a sizeable minority, all of whom have already taken the courses, declared that they supported the faculty decision on the grounds it might force students ""to learn something."" There was widespread disagreement over the validity of the faculty's contention that letter grades in humanities would encourage students to take the courses more seriously. ""Grading will not stimulate studying among disinterested students,"" Steven Sims '73C said yesterday. ""Those who did well in the courses did so because they enjoyed them."" ""As much as I hate to admit it, it's a good idea,"" Gabriel Verrt 73C commented. ""If the idea is tolearn about art and music then the courses should be graded."" However, Gary Kleeman 75C predicted, ""If forced to work and forced to learn something, students will gain something of value from the course."" ""Art humanities was a waste of time,"" Thomas Campbell '75C recalled. ""Students refused to participate and it was impossible for the instructor to take it seriously."" The most vociferous objections to the faculty's decision were voiced by students who felt the new grading system would place an extra burden on students. ""I was looking forward to not being pressured by these subjects,"" Roby Toggweiler '75C said, adding the faculty decision had all but destroyed his hopes. David Arm '75C admitted, ""No one does the work in my art humanities course,"" but added ""with all the other requirements,grading the courses would overburden the students."" Other students shared senior Jack Girgenti's idea that the courses should continue to be passfail because ""they are not courses which are in the mainstream of what most people are used to taking."" ""People are willing to put up with a cultural imposition on them as long as it's not too much of a hass/le,"" Richard Levine '74C remarked. Most students questioned praised the concept of art and music humanities. ""While I didn't get too involved in the subjects, I was glad to have taken the courses and to have gotten something out of them,"" Jerome Sanchy '74C, who praised the faculty decision, commented. Angus Harrigan '75C said he profitted from the courses which he found to be ""designed for people with little or no background in the subjects."" In explaining his support of the faculty decision, Harrigan recalled ""people didn't show up and the teacher had no control over the students."" Marc Chanfaglione '73C proposed ""students should have an option of receiving a grade if they want."" He said that while he ""did not get much out of the courses,"" he ""would have enjoyed taking them under a (letter) grading system."" On Monday, the faculty voted unanimously to end pass-fail grading for art and music humanities beginning next year. At the faculty meeting, Dean Pouncey and Professor of Music Joel Newman urged adoption of the letter grading system which the Committee on Instruction approved by a vote of ten to two last week. Observing that these were the only academic courses with mandatory pass-fail, Professor Newman stated, ""It's to the students best interest to make these courses just like our other courses."" Students in the College are required to take a letter grade in all required courses except physical education."
226,Music Humanities,"1972-73: HEW, Tuition Increase, New Rules, . . .",16 May 1973,"September The Department of Health, Education and Welfare announced that it would accept Columbia's Affirmative Action Plan thereby apparently ending a four-year conflict. A strike by maintenance workers was averted when the university agreed to rescind the firing of thirty maids, thereby ending an eight-month long dispute. The university announced it was considering plans for a multimillion dollar biology tower to be built on the engineering terrace. Reversing a decision made by both former Dean Carl F. Hovde and President McGill, Dean Pouncey issued a statement advocating official recognition of the gay lounge in Furnald Hall. Professor of International Law Wolfgang Friedmann was stabbed to death during a robbery attempt on Amsterdam Avenue between 122 nd and 123 rd Streets. October The administration offered to drop disciplinary charges against students accused of violating the Interim Rules during last spring's strike, if the students agreed not to take part in such activities again. The controversy over a student Trustee flared when President McGill stated that such an appointment would violate Columbia's charter.November For the second time since 1955, the university released a detailed listing of all its investments. The university pledged, in its Affirmative Action Plan, which was released on November 13, to add at least 384 women and 504 members of minority groups to its academic and non-instructional staffs by 1977. The 325-page plan contained detailed provisions for the hiring of additional women and minority group members in virtually every division of the university. Louis D. Volpp, dean of the Graduate School of Business. Administration at Duke University, was named dean of Columbia's School of Business. December President McGill proposed that tuition for the coming academic year be increased to $3180 in all but two divisions ' of the university. Tuition in the College will rise by $380 next year. The tuition hikes planned for the School of the Arts and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences were subsequently rolled back. Donald L. Miller, a black Department of Defense Official, was named to the newly-created post of vice president for personnel management, thereby becoming the highest ranking black in Columbia's history. January It was disclosed that President Nixon's 1973-74 budget would eliminate nearly $2 million in student aid funds for Columbia. Barnard President Martha Peterson announced that Bar--nard's tuition for the 1973-74 academic year would rise $350* to $3100. $195 of the increase will be used to finance Barnard's payments to Columbia for use of the university's facilities. February The Joint Trustee Report on Barnard-Columbia relations which calls for greater cooperation in virtually all areas, was approved by the Trustees of both schools. The report requires Barnard to make an annual payment to Columbia to compensate for the imbalance in costs incurred in the exchange of services between the two schools. In response to complaints filed by the Columbia Administrative Staff Association and the Women's Affirmative Action Coalition protesting alleged violations of the Affirmative Action Plan in two administrative appointments, HEW directed the Office of Naval Research to withhold a $1.9 million contract from Columbia pending an investigation of the charges. Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Wm. Theodorede Bary announced a major proposal calling for greater cooperation among the divisions fo the university and an increase in the number of interdisciplinary courses . March HEW announced that it was restoring the $1.9 million Navy contract to Columbia following an investigation of the alleged violations. After the inquiry, Columbia agreed to amend its antibias plan monitoring procedures. Police arrested six members of the Jewish Defense League who had occupied Dr. McGill's office to protest the university's Affirmatvie Action Plan. During the senate debate over the new Rules of University Conduct, three deans and a professor proposed that the president be virtually required to bring police on campus to end disruptive demonstrations. The proposal was eventually revised to eliminate the provision calling for an automatic response. The College faculty voted unanimously to abolish pass-fail grading for art and music humanities. The senate voted to adopt the Rules of University Conduct which will drastically change the tribunal system and replace the Interim Rules which have governed campus protests since 1968. April Ground was officially broken at the site of the $30.5 million Augustus Long Library Health Science Center at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. As a result of failures to attract 40 per cent of their student bodies to vote in elections for the University Senate, neither Barnard nor College will have- a representative on the body next year. Several popular junior faculty memebers announced they were leaving Columbia to accept positions at schools where the tenure prospects were more favorable. One, Assistant Professor of Art History Eugene Santomasso, was granted an adjunct professorship after studentsprotested his impending departure. More than 100 members of the university's supporting staff voted on April 19 to attempt to unionize 4500 staff workers at Columbia in cooperation with District 65 of the New York Distributive Workers Union. Members of the national Caucus of Labor Committees disrupted an April 23 debate between three mayoral candidates in the Lion's Den. The medical school announced it could lose $5.5 million in federal funds next year if the President's budget is approved by Congress. Congress passed and President Nixon signed a bill that would keep funding for student financial aid at almost the same level it was at this year, thus averting ""posible disaster"" for Columbia.PICTURE OF THE YEAR: The appearance of 'exotic dancer' Patti Wayne, seen above entertaining Ryzard Pisarski '76, at a live strip-tease and sex show presented by the freshman class, provoked a brawl in Wollman Auditorium on April 4.

227,Music Humanities,Jejune Music Room,18 February 1974,"By JOHN T. GRIFFINA good restaurant is composed of three essential elements: a pleasant atmosphere, good service, and above all, good food. (A fourth element might be added— economy. One is willing to overlook this element, however, because economy is only relative to the degree of success a restaurant attains in the three basic areas J The Music Room, located on Broadway between 111 th and 112 th Streets, is somewhat deficient in the first two elements and shamefully lacking in the third. Our supper party of four was lured recently to the restaurant because it plays classical music tapes during the dinner hours. (Chamber groups play on Friday, and Saturday evenings.) The uneasiness that was to characterize our evening was initiated as soon as we entered the place. We were led to a table in the middle of the dark, partitioned dining room which is decorated in an art nouveau, 1930's fashion (with musical artifacts and plastic flowers arranged somewhat less than effectively). Our table was directly in front of a stereo speaker and throughout the meal we were not serenaded but shouted at. It was like Tom's by candlelight. I am willing to overlook atmosphere. After all, great art is often generated in uninspiring surroundings. And if you consider uninspiring conditions to be a prerequisite for profoundcreativity (Dostoyevsky, etc.), The Music Room has a big head start (cheap dishes, flatware, chairs, tables. . .). Unfortunately, this is one restaurant that does not compensate for atmosphere with anything else. Certainly not service. Our waiter was clumsy, and uninformed about his menu. When presenting us with the first course in our $3.95 student dinner (appetizer, entree, dessert), his tie accidentally took a swim in my soup. His remark, ""Oh, I just ruined a perfectly good tie,"" was a bit rude considering restaurant health regulations. The soup should have been replaced immediately, but this did not even occur to him. Other proprieties were overlooked also: in a good restaurant, one does not line up the entrees next to your table ten minutes before you are ready to eat. Having softened these rites d'initiation with $1.50 cocktails (served in the wrong glasses), we were prepared to eat the meal itself. From an adequately balanced, and intelligently unambitious menu, I had chosen the soup de jour (forgive their French, the proprietor is from India), and spare ribs pizzicato. Two of my dining partners chose the spaghetti andante, and an affluent friend selected the beef bourdelaise at a walloping $5.95 for the entree alone. You might have noticed, if you have already takenMusic Humanities, that musical terms are tacked on the names of certain entrees. One term that is often used to describe a musical artist of great accomplishment is missing from the Music Room's vocabulary: virtuoso. If the restaurant's management would forget the fancy Italian and concentrate on some cooking virtuoso, everyone would be happier. My tomato soup was something straight out of Heinz's 57 Varieties:it was a supposedly cream soup that had a water base. The salad dressing was subtle, or if you hate euphemisms, tasteless. The spare ribs were indeed spare, dipped iaa gooey and all-too-sweet barbecue sauce. The rice was almost completely undercooked. This is not a matter of opinion, but a fact: my friends all sampled the rice, and if you press a piece of rice between your fingers and it turns to a dry, sticky paste, the conclusion is obvious. I called the manager over and asked him to try the rice. Instead of taking a clean fork with which to sample it, he put his hands in my plate! To add insult to injury, he insisted that in his country, India, dry, uncooked rice is acceptable. Instead of exchanging the rice for another dish, or even offering to change the rice, he stood there adamantly insisting on his point for ten minutes. My dining partners' meals were equally unacceptable. The beef bourdelaise, which was from a cheap cut of beef, was served with greasy home fried potatoes. Thespaghetti was jejune. All in all, it was a culinary disaster. Needless to say, we did not stay for dessert. I always go into a restaurant looking for positive features. In the Morningside Heights area, it is difficult to maintain this posture for any length of time. The Music Room is a further reason for discouragement. Given the need for good restaurants in this area, and given the certain receptivity of students to a good house of cuisine, The Music Room has a chance to corner the market of Columbians with deadened palates. The restaurant's prices are not out of the range of most students, who could patronize the restaurant occasionally. The restaurant's service and decor could be better tuned. The orchestration of the kitchen could become better integrated. And the music in the dining room could be turned down, or better balanced. If these things are attempted successfully, The Music Room might eventually be playing to standing room crowds."
228,Music Humanities,Deans Say Yes College Program: Strength in Tradition?,19 February 1975,"College Program: Strength in Tradition?By TED GREENDuring the campus upheavals of the late 1960'5, colleges across the nation joined in a flurry of academic reforms aimed at liberalizing their curriculums. Although Columbia was one of the hotbeds of this unrest, the university resisted the reformist trend and held to its traditional, highly structured curriculum. Now, College officials claim that this policy is paying rich dividends... As College Dean Peter Pouncey said recently, ""Our name has grown largely since 1968. We have received considerable admiration for holding to our liberal arts curriculum. . .Many students are starting to feel that we held a positive line on curriculum."" And, in keeping with this philosophy, the College has recently shown a marked resistance to experimentation and liberalization of the curriculum. Indications of this practice came as far back as 1973, when the College decided to abolish mandatory pass-fail grading for the required art and music humanities courses. By reinstating letter grades, the viability of the old-style, stricter curriculum was reaffirmed.Similarly, the recent ""reform"" of the College's freshman English courserepresents an acceptance of the traditional requirements. In effect, by excising the literary aspects of the course in favor of an approach aimed solely at developing writing skills, the College is reverting to the old, reliable method. The College's steadfast adherence to a conservative education, and ""unwillingness to yield to the rhetoric of the sixties"" has won strong support from President McGill. ""Large-scale restructuring must be reserved for the younger schools. Our structure has been built for 200 years. The best we can do is preserve it,"" the President said, adding that ""innovation for innovation's sake is futile."" Another notable example was the College's rejection of a proposal for three new majors in the arts, because they were considered ""inconsistent with the College's curriculum."" Rather than having to defend these policies against charges that they are reactionary or anachronistic, Collegeofficials feel that a favorable climate now exists for academic conservatism. The primary reason for the renewed faith in a curriculum such as the College's is thaqt it offers students an advantage in competing for admission to professional schools. ""The Columbia degree is a major advantage to a student seeking some sort of special position in his profession,"" President McGill said recently.College officials agree that Columbia is becoming more attractive to students than it had been in the past, and credit its conservative curriculum with contributing to this year's increase in applications. But, if the curriculum remains unchanged, student motivations for studying under it apparently have. Professor of Philosophy Richard Kuhns, a member of the College Committee on Instruction (COD, noted that in the past, when a student would go to Columbia ""as a poor lower east side New Yorker and end up as a doctor"" he was""compelled to study CC and humanities"" in order to round out his education. Now, it is feared that students are taking advantage of Columbia's traditional liberal arts program merely because it provides a sure-fire ticket inot professional school. However, Associate Dean of the College Michael Rosenthal stated that, ""Our mission remains the same. Our aim is to provide a general education."" Rosenthal added that the fact that the undergraduate program was good preparation for professional school was a ""fringe benefit.""College faculty, deans discuss curriculum changes."
229,Music Humanities,On the College Dean's Four Year Tenure,12 May 1976,"By DAVID RAABPeter Pouncey leaves Columbia College about as he found it, only more so. The trends, and the problems of the College at the start of Pouncey's four-year tenure as Dean are still its dominant features today, and in most cases have intensified. A conservative curriculum has become yet more pure and traditional, the task of attracting a quality student body has become still more difficult, decrepit housing has continued to deteriorate, the gap between tuition and financial aid has yawned ever wider, fiscal squeeze has leashed ever tighter the ability to experiment and improve. Even pre-professionalism, the bane of liberal humanists—Pouncey included— which now grips the campus, had its first tentative flowerings in the Hartley grub room during Pouncey's initial year. Caught in this descending spiral, much of what Pouncey has done has been in reaction to the pressure and trends of his time. That the problems now seem more intense is partly because they have in fact gotten worse—in the past four years, no one at Columbia seems to have been able to deal effectively with any of the University's ills. But the more stark picture is also in part a result of Pouncey's success at defining and illuminating the College's problems and concerns. The Dean's particular talent has been to turn this rather dismal necessity into something like a virtue. Take, for instance, the College curriculum. Pouncey took office as the last vestiges of 1960's activism were quickly vanishing from campus. In curricular matters, the new conservatism meant chipping away at changes which had loosened the College's rigid structure during the previous decade — the relatively liberal Freshman Seminar course, pass-fair grades for Art and Music Humanities, instructors' discretion in Contemporary Civilization readings. It also meant rejection of new proposals for change—abolition of the F, replacement of the science requirement with a general science course, establishment of undergraduate arts majors. Although Pouncey has generally supported these conservative measures, he has not been perceived as a leader in academic affairs. Rather, the dean's major contribution has been to provide an overall rationale for the faculty's decisions: the image of the College curriculum as a bastion of old-fashioned standards and liberal values, unsullied by compromises with contemporary decline. A neat and effective justification aimed specifically at the preprofessionals tells them that the ""integrity"" of the Columbia curriculum is precisely what will get them all into law or medical school. In other areas the relationship between the Dean's words and actual achievements is less clear. Perhaps the most celebrated aspect of Pouncey's tenure has been his highly public jousting with Low Libraryover issues ranging from the end of fiscal austerity to the return of ROTC. Many, including Pouncey himself, have questioned whether a less vocal approach might not have produced greater concrete results. The conflict began virtually with Pouncey's taking office: before the end of his first September as Dean he had granted official recognition to the Gay Lounge in Furnald Hall, reversing the decision of his predecessor and acting against President McGill's advice and wishes. The lounge issue became the Thucydides scholar's private Sicilian Expedition, as the trustees and McGill forced him to rescind an alumnus' $3,500 donation to the lounge, given through the Dean's Discretionary Fund. (McGill's victory was empty, if not Pyrrhic, however: a second $1,500 donation by the alumnus went directly to the Lounge, which still exists.) Later battles were chosen a bit more carefully, and usually centered on finance. Pouncey consistently drew attention to the academic costs of financial austerity, calling in January 1974 for whatever deficit was needed to preserve academic quality. The most acrimonious issue was tuition, with Pouncey and other undergraduate division heads arguing for the principle of charging professional schools higher rates than undergraduates. The theory was that higher tuitions posed less of a threat to graduate school student quality than to undergraduate, and the corollary was that tuition hikes must be matched by financial aid increases. Pouncey never stopped advocating this position, although his criticisms became less public and more private as his term wore on. During his first fall as dean, he publicly blasted Low Library fiscal experts for not knowing ""a damn thing"" about education, but by the spring of 1975 he reacted to a meager $40 tuition differential with calm, a reference to Columbia's economic problems, and praise for McGill's decision as ""statesmanlike."" Whether a less public policy would have been more effective is impossible to determine. In 1971-72, when Pouncey was most vocal, the College was excluded from a hike reduction given three other divisions facing enrollment problems, but the school's increase was still $200 less than that given most professional schools. In more recent years, differential hikes have been the rule,with the College usually getting the lowest increase—but the gaps have been small. Similarly, although the College has received an increasing proportion of its tuition revenues back from Low Library, the percentage has not risen as high as the dean had hoped, and financial aid packages have not kept pace with rising tuition and other costs. Moreover, the College has had firm statistical evidence to back Pouncey's public claims of a threat to admissions standards. What would have happened to College tuition without that evidence is unknown. An entertaining sidelight to Pouncey's disputes with Low Library has been the personal enmity between him and Vice President for Academic Affairs Wm. Theodore de Bary. Cautious, inarticulate and almost painfully shy, de Bary presents a polar contrast to ""the Pounce."" The two have been on opposite sided of many issues, including institution of fine arts majors in the College, expanding the use of graduate students to teach undergraduates, the importance of de Bary's beloved General Education Seminars, and expansion of College enrollment. Although devastatingly eloquent in private on the Vice President's shortcomings, Pouncey until this year had been restrained in public. However, as he approached the end of his tenure the Dean became more vocal. Incensed by a central administration proposal that the College expand next year's enrollment by three hundred students, which Pouncey saw as a serious threat to the College's quality, the Dean issued particularly harsh public condemnations of de Bary's ""failure"" to act or plan effectively during his five years in office. The Dean also criticized McGill for retaining de Bary and others on his staff. But on some issues, Pouncey and the central administration have worked together. His call last autumn for merger with Barnard, or unilateral College coeducation, was not backed by Low Library, but McGill was able to use the pressure in his own campaign to wrest financial and administrative concessions from the school. Pouncey's reorganization proposal, similar to plans offered by the College in 1970 and 1972, called for merger of allUniversity undergraduate programs. Roundly attacked by Barnard and the School of General Studies, the plan never had a real chance of adoption, as Pouncey undoubtedly realized. But he presented it in the hope of stirring debate and promoting some sort of movement: a tactic characteristic of the Pouncey public style. The call for coeducation also touches another recurring Pouncey theme: the desire to improve student life as a way of increasing the College's attraction for students. Pouncey called for new undergraduate dormitories as early as September 1973, at a time when the central administration was placing a higher priority on new housing for graduate students. The call was rather quickly transmuted by fiscal reality into proposals for renovations of current housing, also not accomplished, but the dream of a new College dorm persisted. This spring, after a group of distinguished College alumni working with Pouncey issued another call for a new dorm, the central administration finally moved to support the idea. Bound by fiscal restraints and hemmed in by Columbia's bureaucracy, Pouncey was able to accomplish little of substance in improving College life. Dormitories, food services, libraries, health care, classroom facilities, security, the bursar and the registrar were all beyond his control, and within the Dean's Office financial cuts left little room for new projects. Yet by careful use of his office's prestige and the Dean's Discretionary Fund, Pouncey has been able to help make small improvements. The Furnald Grocery, King's Pub and controversial Columbia TV station, all were helped by his support. In one of the few administrative areas he does control—College fundraising efforts, which go mainly to financial aid—he has also made major improvements. But above all Pouncey has been master of the symbol. Actions such as the Gay Lounge recognition, appointment of the first black dean, and public support of student demands for University financial data had little real impact, but were artfully presented by Pouncey to show independence from Low Library and give some illusion of liberalism and progress. Actions helping individuals, such as Pouncey's wellpublicized request for the return of an admissions form subpoenaed after a student's arrest on drug charges, added to his image as a friend and protector of College students. These symbols are Pouncey's real contribution to the College. In a period when little of substance could be accomplished by a dean, he helped unite and hearten a dispirited division with witty and eloquent advocacy of College interests. A colorful figure in an otherwise dreary gaggle of administrators, he defined and exemplified the College's ideals—and gave spirit and purpose to an embattled institution."
230,Music Humanities,FEEDBACK Timely Warning,13 September 1976,"Timely WarningHaving just completed my second year of registration and book buying I would like to bring two frustrating facts to Barnard students' attention. If a Barnard student pre-registers the preceeding semester for a sectioned Columbia course it means nothing. In order to take the course she must\ register with Columbia College students on the usual first come first served basis. Returning Barnard students should note that this means coming into the City before the dorms open just to register. Examples of sectioned courses are C.C., Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. Columbia students will be interested to learn that they must pre-register in the preceeding semester for Barnard's sectioned courses (i.e.: Poet's Physics, Psychology 5, Economics 1). Even if you do register and/or pre-register for these classes there is no guarantee that you will not be bumped because of last minute changes in sections (like the one that occurred this semester in the Music Department.) A second source of irritation is the Barnard I.D. card. The temporary I.D. and the I.D. cards of the class of 1979 do not bear signatures. Without a signature verification the Columbia Bookstore does not like to accept a personal check, so be prepared for a possible hassle. If program filing goes well my faith in Alma Mater will be restored. A ~ _ April Sparnaugle, '79 Barnard"
231,Music Humanities,Freshmen ineligibility: only the strong survive Forum,10 March 1977,"ForumBy Steven FineA phone rings. A phenomenal high school basketball player in Buffalo lifts the receiver and discovers that Columbia coach Tom Penders is calling for the umpteenth time to see if he'll come to Columbia. The 6-6 superstar with all the moves and all the shots tells Penders that he's not sure yet, but if the Ivy League passed a ruling which is pending with the Ivy presidents that would permit freshmen to play varsity basketball, he'd be on the first train to New York. Another scene. A 6-8 mediocre ballplayer sits on the end of the Lion bench watching his teammates demolish Dartmouth in the season finale. He gazes at the clock as it winds down to :00 and realizes that yet another season has passed and he has picked up more splinters than points. And he says to himself, there are a couple of hotshots on the freshman team who are going to replace me next year and I won't be able to do what ISteven Fine, C79, enjoys writing for Spectator and playing basketball more than taking music humanities.want, which is to play basketball. So this is my last season, and I haven't played which is all I really want to do. These two situations illustrate what is wrong with Ivy basketball—not allowing freshmen to play on the varsity level and the absence of a junior varsity squad which would provide an opportunity for average athletes to participate and refine their talents. But it also illustrates a fundamental error in the Ivy League's philosophy regarding students and student activities. Arbitrary rules that govern who shall play and who shall sit are anteduluvian and need reevaluation. The combination of these rules and the financial aid policies of the eight schools have left them in a position which discourages student activities and leaves students bitter. The reasoning behind prohibiting freshmen on varsity basketball teams is a belief that a first-year student has enough problems adjusting to college life and higher academics without the added pressure of playing so-called major college basketball. ""But we recruit outstanding student-athletes who have proventhemselves both in the classroom and on the playing fields while in high school,"" says Penders. ""Otherwise we wouldn't have accepted them here. They've learned how to budget their time to playing and studying already."" Admittedly, living away from home for the first time is a factor which differentiates high school athletes from college athletes. But basketball is primarily a spring semester sport—a freshman willsoccer player different from a basketball player? John McElaney was the starting goal tender on this fall's soccer team and he is a freshman. But he had to play on the freshman basketball team. I think he would be terribly confused."" The college presidents are trying to convince McElaney that he was able to cope with the pressures of college life and soccer in the fall (with no semesters under his belt) and unable to cope with thosehave had a full semester to get acquainted with dormitories, humanities professors and the College library. But if the college presidents feel that an entire year is necessary for freshmen to get acclamated, how do they explain permitting freshmen to participate on varsity soccer, cross country, swimming, wrestling, track, golf, tennis, fencing, crew and baseball teams?pressures and basketball in the winter when he would have had t semester behind him. The presidents' position is illogical. Preventing someone from competing on the varsity level while a freshman, however, is minor compared to the trap facing those upperclassmen who are not skilled enough to play on the varsity. They have no level at all on which to compete. But if the freshman eligibility amendment is passed it would dissolve the current freshman team and create a junior varsity program that would be open to all undergraduates. ""Under the present system, there's no room for progress,' says Penders. ""The mediocre kid on the freshman team hasn't played all season, he hasn't developed and now he has little chance of making the varsity as a sophomore. And he wants to play. ""The same thing applies to the mediocre kid on the varsity,""""I see inequity in Ivy sports,"" remarked Penders, addressing himself to the obvious. ""Why is a"

233,Music Humanities,Basketball team gets Albert King,31 March 1977,"By GOGOL MOGOLPRINCETON, N.J., Mar. 31—Ivy League presidents and athletic directors met in an all-night session last night and approved freshman eligibility for varsity basketball next year. The decision, a hotly debated issue centering on whether freshmen would be able to handle the pressures of academia and major college basketball, was finally resolved when Columbia's delegation, President McGill and Al Paul, was"" informed by basketball coach Tom Penders that all-World Albert King of Brooklyn would attend Columbia only if he could play varsity ball as a freshman. McG^ n and Paul quickly changed their previous nay vote to a yeaand the controversial freshman elegibility resolution passed, 5-3. ""I've got a letter of intent from Albert,"" said a delerious Penders. ""If you thought Alton Byrd and Ricky Free put Columbia on the basketball map, wait until the Lou Gehrig loungers get as whiff of Albert's backward pumping deliver-us-from-evil scare jam, his unbelievably terrifying De Laurentiis Memorial gorilla stuff or his outrageous whirlybird windmill swoop hooker from pike position, i.e. Yo Mama Dunk,"" exclaimed Penders. McGill explained that he was originally against changing the freshman rule because he said, ""It takes at least a year and a half to get used to this institute of higher learning. I mean how is a greenhorned rookie supposed toadjust to such titans of teaching as music humanities professor Lyman Conehead while at the same time have to deal with Gordon S. White of the Times? ""But,"" he added, ""with Albert, I'll be able to fund the chair that Henry Kissinger needs to come here. Also, I can show Derek Bok and Kingman Brewster just who's boss in this league,"" McGill said giggling. Paul said that King's presence will bring big bucks to the school and he'll be able to finance the Baker Field renovation project, which will get track coaches Irv Kintisch and Pete Schuder off his back. The new ruling, however, did not exude satisfaction from the current Lion basketball players. They claimed that King's ability onthe court is so overpowering that Penders will only carry a sevenman squad for the next four years. ""I've been here two years,"" said reserve guard Tim Gilfoyle, ""and I haven't had to take a post-game shower yet. Forget about next vear—they won't even have to worry about washing my uniform.'' Alton Byrd, currently the Lions' resident superstar, was equally angry with the decision. ""Hey man, I don't like another brother butting in on my territory. Things were going good here for a while."" But Penders, in his usual sympathetic tones, remarked, ""The hell with those guys. I don't need them. I can put Albert oh the court with four pre-meds and still win the national title."""
234,Music Humanities,"The Stroller Music Hum, the classics and sexual inadequacy",18 May 1977,"Music Hum, the classics and sexual inadequacyBy JAMIE KITMANCentral to the outmoded educational theory by which Columbia College attempts to steep its students in Western reality is the College's Music Humanities requirement. In order to graduate students must complete the one semester course and, in doing so, must submit one or two papers describing and analyzing classical music concerts which they are also required to attend. We went over to McMillan Hall the other day to see a concert. A group of good-thinking patrons and serious Upper West Side musicians who caal themselves West Side Orchestral Concerts Inc. presented symphonies by Beethoven and Haydn with a Brahms serenade betweeen them. The concert, which began promptly at three, and preparing to write this paper, which happened less promptly 14 hours later, underlined some of the problems inherent in this particular aspect of the Music Humanities requirement. It would be pointless, at best, to pretend that many of the fine young men enrolled in the College possess any insight into classical music. Along with the numerous College brothers who would discuss Marxian interpretations of Lao Tzu and his effect upon racing applications of '55 Chevy small-blocks more intelligently than Brahms serenades, I cannot pretend to either. In defense of the ignorant I must hastily add, however, that this lack, while in a certain sense our own faults, is primarily the responsibility of larger American society and its educational system. From the first moment a young American is conscious, he is told by popular media forms (especially television) that classical music is the domain of the overly intellectual, the boring, the weak and, at root, the sexually inadequate. Television has fostered implicit mental associations between classical music and age and one, quite mistakenly, might be led to believe that only old people listen to and enjoy classical music. Which would not be a problem if popular media hadn't also taught us that oldness is badness. To be old, among other things, is to be sexually inferior. Nobody wants to be old, nobody wants to be sexually inferior and hardly any 6 young people want to listen to classical music.The state of musical education in the majority of America's public schools doesn't help much either. Within the context of an educational system which, through liberal application of bells, detentions and rigid curriculum requirements, teaches students how to stop appreciating learning for learnings 's sake, this is not surprising. There are things which you must learn and, for learning them, you are rewarded with grades, awards and acceptances from expensive eastern universities. There are other things which you may learn at school, but only if you want to. When you stop spelling, adding and reciting Wilson's Fourteen Points at three when the bell rings, real learning, the kind you get concretely rewarded for, is through for the day. We live in a society which does its finest work supplying immediate gratification. Our cars, radar ranges and electric pencil sharpeners give us what we want fast. Similarly, popular musical forms can be quickly assimilated into modern man's mind. Though often simple and requiring minimum virtuousity, the music is driven and provides immediate results. Automatically. Classical music requires greater thought, patience and time. Where's the beat, what are the words and isn't this too hard to listen to, say many young Americans. They don't understand it and, for the most part, don't care to. As one who includes the electric guitar along with the crossbow and sub-automatic machine gun as western man's most important techno-cultural developments, I also never learned to appreciate classical music. Believing that anything with such an ardent following necessitates investigation, however, I would like to. But a three month music humanities section at Columbia College comes too late to right the damage. For proof, one need only have witnessed 30 music humanities students clapping to the embarrassed fidgeting of conductor Fredique Petrides while the orchestra prepared to begin the second movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 103. Apparently, they weren't supposed to clap."
235,Music Humanities,FORUM Is the College perpetrating intellectual fraud?,27 October 1977,"Is the College perpetrating intellectual fraud?By JIM SCHACHTERColumbia College's image of itself as a center for liberal education is intellectually fraudulent. The fellow who writes in the front of the College bulletin that ""a career in Columbia College centers on the work in general education and in the academic department of one's major"" is either a liar or a fool. The College is not a locus of humane learning because the undergraduates enrolled in it are not members of an intellectual community. A career here centers not on general or major area studies, not on anything else that is a subarea or function of the instructional facets of the university. Instead, a large portion of the College's enrollees choose to allow extra-university, extra-intellectual activities to dominate their time and interest during their stay here. And rightly so. It is fitting that students do not take an interest in their college, because their college takes no interest in them. The circle works like this: Columbia College lets its students go their own way; then the students allow the College to go its separate way; and then the College, figuring that its students don't care about it, decides that it is hopeless to try to involve students in authentic, intense learning, let alone making decisions that effect the day-to-day and long range operation of the university. What are the results of this diffusion of student interests? For the students, the result is sophistication. We forget that ""sophistication"" has a perjorative connotation. The sophisticate is one who, mainly familiar with the superficial aspects of life, exists in the realm of superficiality. Many of Columbia's undergraduates choose to attend this school because it is in New York, America's cultural center. These students get through their classes, often gaining good marks, but their major interest is in some aspect of the city's cultural life. The culture lovers can be divided into two groups. First are those interested in mastering a particular artistic skill—musicians, dancers, sculptors, actors—or in authentically understanding an art. Such individuals subsume their lives to their interest and associate with others equally engaged in gaining aesthetic ability or comprehension. That is, these primary lovers of culture participate in an intellectual community centered on their interest, no doubt finding members of that community both within the university and without. The second group of culture lovers is composed of those who merely admire the arts, that is, the sophisticates. When a new ballet company comes to town, they're off to watch it. A new Italian movie? Seeing it soon after its release is a must. The sophisticate is obligated to be current in his area of sophistication. He must know what operas are on the Met's calendar for the next year, and it doesn't hurt to be familiar with the backstage bickering that resulted in that calendar. These are thethings the sophisticate thinks about and discusses. He is truly fascinated by such details and believes he is an expert of sorts. ""Yet how different is it to be an expert in the comings and goings of dramas than in the comings and goings of Jackie Onassis? And where is the greater show of profundity in knowing what movies ought to be ""important"" next fall rather than knowing what shoes will be in style at Christmas-time. We condemn the person who worries about celebrities as a gossip, and call the fashion-plate vain. Both are guilty of superficiality. And so, clearly enough, is that second kind of culture lover found around Columbia, the sophisticate. And just as he who is concerned about celebrities when he is eighteen is concerned about celebrities when he is thirty-six, so the sophisticated college student will be the sophisticated young and middle-aged adult. I assert that, in great measure, the people Columbia College is turning out arewhat the sophisticated media refer to as ""the Beautiful People."" Their jobs are ""right""; their clothes are ""right""; their friends are ""right""; their interests are ""right."" And they are hulks hopelessly awash in a sea of superficiality. Columbia is entwined in a web of sophistication. The political sophisticates, for example, place posters around campus to announce meetings in support of every nationalist movement imaginable. The members of Ethiopian and Chilean and Zionist solidarity groups all primarily exhibit a superficial and selfish understanding of the world. Consumed with the defense of one nationality's interests, usually their own, they are as egocentric as the Beautiful People, except that they are concerned with the self-importance of one national among all the nations rather than that of one person among humanity. How is Columbia College to blame for the fact that is producing superficial, selfish sophisticates?It is at fault because it does not demand its students' attention. It does not care whether the young men with whose liberal education it is entrusted ever gain the curiosity, knowledge, and judgment an education should imspire and provide. One might argue that Columbia students attend those unique Contemporary Civilization and Humanities classes which are designed to broaden minds and force and force young people to form defensible opinions. As far as this picture is reality, C.C. and Hum are the best things the College has to offer. However, as anyone who has sat in a required general education class knows, C. C. and Hum. are not necessarily dynamic intellectual experiences. Reading is not done. A few people, not always the best informed, dominate discussion. The essentials of each text may not be touched on. Too many of the students, then, do not care about the classes. Why don't they care? They don't carebecause the College has told them it doesn't care whether the students learn anything in the socalled ""core"" courses. Inane discussion is tolerated. Nonreading is not questioned. Mediocre papers receive above average marks. And, let's face it: just about everyone gets a good grade at the end of the term.* The general education classroom is not an intellectual community; rather it is the bedchamber of mediocrity. And the administrators and faculty of Columbia College are to blame for the mediocrity. They set the standards. How may Columbia's claim to being a bastion of liberal education be made valid? First, more must be expected of the student in the classroom. If a student is to get a good grade, he must learn. If he is to master the subject area of a general education course, he must read the books upon which the class discussions and written work are based. Teachers must be set free to force compliance with these learning rules; they must be allowed and even told to give spot quizzes that check for reading and comprehension, to weight marks heavily on the basis of intelligent participation in daily discussion, to be sure a paper is of high quality before it is given a good mark. (I do not suggest that good grades should be the final cause of learning. However, in the transistional period preceding the establishment of an intellectual community in the College, the use of grades to evaluate quality of learning might motivate students to dedicate themselves to their work.) If this commitment to deeper understanding of the great ideas of all times makes it impossible to read all the books presently covered, let the reading lists be cut. We cannot understand everything; we ought to understand something. Second, the university must develop a program which allows students to meet and converse intelligently with each other and with representatives of the faculty and administration on a regular, informal, but required basis. A setting wherein six or seven students are invited to a professor's apartment for a homecooked meal (paid for by the university) could well be an opportunity for the students and instructor to enlighten each other. The important issues of the moment could be discussed more fully than a class setting allows. The university recognizes the value of such discussions. Among the better kept secrets of the College is its John Jay National Scholars program, which honors the top one per cent of the freshman class. Its main selling point is a monthly dinner attended by the ten or twelve scholars, and an administrator or two, a faculty member, and a celebrated person from the New York area. Whyshould such an opportunity for mind-broadening be limited to an elite of the College? Am I advocating a return to paternalism? Not really. Intensified core courses and dinnerdiscussions with professors in attendance would not have the effect of making students accept a body of opinions handed down the the Benevolent Fathers of the College. Rather, such profound learning activities would more likely be cells of enlightenment. The better informed and wiser a man becomes today, the better able he is to see the faults in the make-up of the world, and the more likely he is to take action to improve humanity. This campus, like many others, exploded in violent rejection of the ways of the world in tin the late 1960s because groups of serious students met to study and discuss issues of worldwide significance in an historical context. And if those students had cooperated with their teachers, if the two groups hadbeen co-learners, the 60s movement might have had a firmer intellectual and practical basis. In France, where the agitators of the 60' s were a coalition of students and teachers and workers, the Left now has the chance to take control of the government. Neither am I proposing the nurture of ascetic eggheads. Again, the person of learning is bound to appreciate the complexities of the work, haveheightened passions, and care deeply about many facets of culture. He'll be interested in theatre, music, sport, dance, humor, realizing that to understand the harmious and conflicting relationships of these is to understand a large part of humanity. The intellectual will enjoy, intellectually. With the adoption of these"
236,Music Humanities,How to do nothing,31 August 1978,"When I first got to Columbia, I thought guts were innards, or at least the overhang caused by feeding them too much. But around here, guts is slang for Courses that Require a Minimur Amount of Effort. Yes, yes, this ts the Ivy League, and we're a liberal arts institution and each point of credit represents one hour in the classroom or two in the lab; but there are better ways to earn your 124 credits ihan taking 40-odd organic chemistry courses. Now, if you want to go to med or law school, forget it, don't bother reading on, you should be studying (the slang is grubbing, you are a grub, and that is not a compliment). For the rest of you — There is nothing you can do about required courses— except to take them in the right way. For the College, they suggest you take Contemporary Civilization as a freshman and Humanitiesas a sophomore. This is either because ihey are stupid, or just hale kids. CC (as it is universally known) is the ""great political writings of Western Civilization."" Now, I ask you— what could be less interesting? On the other hand, Humanities are the ""great works of fiction."" Which is to say, you read a couple of decent adventures, some fantasy and sci-fi, and a good war novel. By the time you're a sophomore, you should be familiar enough with school lo get around those unreadable tomes in CC, as a freshman you'll just be bored. The other twin requirements, An and Music Humanities, also should be taken in sensible order. Art Hum is a fairly interesting survey of art. Music Hum is a rather monomaniacal view of what some old curmudgeon somewhere thinks is important music—in other words, classical. They start off with Gregorian chants (the monks' version of ""A Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall"") and take you right into the thrfse Bs —Bad, Boring and Blech. (There are actually professors cognizant of the fact that rock, blues, jazz, etc. exist, but how can they rate the monks over Bob Dylan?) Take gym when you're a freshman. If you've read the bulletin carefully, you know that you don't have lo major in anything —you can concentrate. The difference while you're here is great; outside of Columbia it's negligible. To concentrate means to have less or no seminar requirement, usually no required courses in the department, and less courses in ihe subject. Which is a better deal, considering no employer is going lo care anyway. And sincethere are less requirements to fill up your schedule, you've got more room for guts. There are several ways to sniff out a gut. When you get good ai it, you become a gut gunner (that is a compliment, except when used by grubs or reactionary faculty members and administrators). One easy indicator is an R before a course number. R is the code for School of the Arts. If you're willing to spend six hours a week and get your hands a little dirty, you can get three points in drawing, painting, or sculpture courses. There are also film and theater courses, but these usually require papers. Another (usually) surefire method of spotting a gut is to see if the course is being taught by a Visiting Professor. These guys are going to be leaving at the end of the year, and they don't really want to spend months or even years hassling out little details like incompletes and requests for makeup exams. (One note of caution: check and see where the prof is visiting from. If it's a Professor of Military Drilling at i he Prussian Army Academy, think twice about taking the course. Similarly, courses taught by famous people tend to be guts. They also don't have time to fuss around with college students. If they did, they wouldn't be famous. If you just got off the bus from the Midwest and don't know any famous people, fear not. You can tell because they almost always have leaching assistants. However, there are some professors who think they're famous even when they aren't, so they go hire TAs anyway. Since these people are egomaniacs they naturally feel that the subject they have deigned to teach is of earth-shattering importance and every little twerp who takes it should be prepared to work their tail off for it. Well, you could check the Who's Who. A not so sure method of finding guts is going by the ratings in Course Guide. The problem with that is, a professor seeing that everybody and his dog thought a particular course was too easy will change the requirements and you'll be stuck with an inchihick syllabus. But if you can get a hold of several back issues, you may find certain pedagogues who are famous for their gutty offerings. These are pretty safe. Another way to use publications to your advantage is to check the last two copies of the course catalogue. When somebody gets canned or takes a year's leave, and their course has to be given by somebody else, well it's obvious that the sub is not an omniscient expert on the subject, and can't afford to work you too hard because he just read the book the night before and it would be embarrassing for a student who read ahead to know more than the prof which could very well happen. On the other hand, some new teachers, who know a fair amount about their subject, but who have little or no previous eperience, tend to be scared of their classes and compensate by being overly harsh. Liberal arts courses tend to be safer than science courses because most science courses are marked ""on the curve,"" which means two per cent of the class is going to fail and about 13 per cent get Ds. But science courses intended for liberal arts students often overcom pen sate for an assumed idiocy on the part of the humanists, and are incredibly easy. Literature courses, especiallythematic ones, tend to be guts, mainly because you can choose in an area that interests you and then all you've got to do is rea*d books that you may well have seen previously, and write a paper on the subject that inlerests you. Stay away from survey courses. These prepare you for everything else in the department, or so I hey pretend, and have reading lists that look like phone books (New York phone books). They are usually numbered ClOOl or something low like that. Conversely, courses that don't require the intro course in departments where most generally do (follow that?) probably are guts. A bit of philosophy of guttiness. Some freshmen (but rarely upperclassmen) feel a bit guilty —the folks are paying megabucks to send junior to college, why is he fingerpainting? But the purpose of this institution (a fact which many administrators lose sight of) is to train young men to run this society. Part of running the system, or at least getting to the top of it, involves getting around it. You could think of it as a training period. Also, even the most atavistic lunatic would have to concede that what you actually learn here is not all that important. It's more of how you learn it. And finally, when dealing with professors and administrators who make unwarranted noise about your progress, remember that you are a student at an Ivy League college (arguably the best for a number of reasons) — they most likely never were, and that makes you superior to them.The author has been here too long to put his name on an article like this."
237,Music Humanities,"But hell, I'm dreaming",20 March 1980,"By THEODORE J. JOHNSON IIThe weekend of February 15-17 was important for Black recruiting at Columbia. The Black Recruitment Committee of the College Admissions Office and Black Student Organization sponsored its first, of hopefully many ""Black Applicant's Academic Weekend."" The weekend was an outstanding success. We hosted 62 applicants who had travelled from as far as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dayton. Most applicants enjoyed themselves immensely. By the end of the weekend, many of the applicants now preferred Columbia to the other Ivy league schools. This, after all, was what the promotional weekend was supposed to do anyway. But the weekend was a success because we engaged in a small game of deception. The Columbia that we presented really is not the Columbia that exists from day to day. We promoted the social aspects, briefly told what it was like to go to school here, and concealed the numerous prejudices manifested by this university. If the ap-plicants had had the opportunity to spend some time with us, they would have noticed that there are not too many Black students in the college. And, as for Black professors, to say that they do not exist is not that inaccurate. Minority recruitment at Columbia is, for all practical purposes, the responsibility of the various ethnic student organizations. In the case of Black recruitment, about 15 students do all the work. The group recruits nationally with an extensive spring follow up program. In addition to our February weekend we in conjunction with the other Black organizations sponsor a Black pre-freshman weekend in Appil. Our other duties include the production of recruitment publications, the strengthening of ties between Black students and alumni, and conducting campus tours. College seniors take an active role in the admissions process by conducting interviews and evaluating applications for the entering freshman class. We students already have too much work to do without theburden of travelling for a week just to sustain the low, 4.7 per cent Black population in this institution. We all know the College Admissions office has problems. The Black recruiting budget is only 50 per cent of that of any other Ivy league school and currently we do not have an officer responsible for Black recruiting. Perhaps this situation will change with the appointment of a minority admissions oficer next fall but I doubt it. Instead, I suspect that this officer will find out what we of the committee already know. That other than the prestige of being an Ivy league school (for what that's worth?), Columbia has few amenities to offer the Black student. Often on our recruiting trips we find that the forces of H,Y,& P have previously succeeded in convincing Black high school seniors to apply and later attend their institutions. They succeed because they can offer such things as Black Studies Programs, Black professors, a large Black population, and finally meaningful financial support. When asked if we can do the same, the answer, much to our embarrassment, is no. It should be aparent that the admissions office is not entirely responsible for the meager Black population at Columbia. Institutions of Columbia's caliber should address more than formal academic topics; the university should be an integral part, of the community. But if you look at Columbia and especially Columbia's course offerings, you would think that the school was located around 60th and Park rather than in Morningside Heights. Columbia through its curriculum, effectively excludes New York's Black Population. This should not be. Columbia has one of the greatest sources of information right next door, Harlem. There is not reason why this school should not have the best Black studies program in the country on its campus. Likewise there should be a center for Hispanics too. Programs such as these would benefit the white population at this university too. Few students realize the cultural center Harlem once was for New York. The fact that the region hasdeteriorated should be the focus •of someone's study. Once again, why couldn't that research be based at Columbia. It is scary to think of the resources, but blocks away, that are being wasted. Forever. But hell, I'm dreaming. Returning to the present, for many Black college students,, the heart of this disparity is Columbia's core liberal arts curriculum. In principle the program is not bad. Through structured survey courses of humanities, students are supposed to be introduced to new ideas and beliefs. But in reality the program is very biased. Our humanities section is poor because it recognizes only the dominant culture. This complaint is not one held by minorities either. A case inpoint is Contemporary Western Civilization more commonly known in Black circles as Contemporary White Civilization. Our faculty seems to think that Asia and Africa do not exist. This analogy need not be restricted to CC either. When was the last time you heard any Asian and African music in Music Humanities? And for an art survey course, the absence of Oriental and African art in Art Humanities makes studying the Greek Parthenon, seem like a study of current events. The reason for this omission as told by one instructor is the ""primitive nature"" of the two cultures. j Black students must ""serve time"" enduring a core curriculum that means relatively little to them. That time isn't cheap either; nominally it is $4,000 of tuition. This is the reality facing the Black applicant to Columbia. The insensitivity to minority - concerns should not be a characteristic of institutions of higher learning and particularly Columbia, scene of student consciousness in 1968. High power recruiting may change the number of Black students on campus, but a more effective measure would be for the university administration to respond to Black needs both on and off campus. Only then will Black recruitment cease to be a problem.Theodore J. Johnson 11, a junior in the College, is a member of the College's Black recruitment committee."
238,Music Humanities,Stern tells COI of coed proposals,24 September 1981,"By TODD BRESSIProvost Fritz Stern last week told the College Committee on Instruction about the tentative accord to make Contemporary Civilization and the College's three-part Humanities series required courses for Barnard students. Stern's presentation marked the first time a university official involved with the Barnard-Columbia negotiations brought proposals from the bargaining table to the College for discussion. But the proposal has not yet been presented to the COI for formal action, according to COI chairman Michael Rosenthal. Rosenthal, who refused to give details of the discussion, said he assumed the committee would eventually be presented with a document for formal consideration but that he had ""no idea"" of when that may happen or if there was any timetable for discussion of the proposal. President Sovern told the University Senate last week that Barnard and Columbia have reached ""agreements in principle"" to require Barnard students to take ContemporaryCivilization and Humanities. Those agreements include not only Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization but also Art and Music Humanities, Provost Peter Likins said Tuesday. Sovern told the Senate, however, that the agreements would only take effect if a more ""comprehensive understanding"" could be reached with Barnard. He declined to say what a ""comprehensiveunderstanding"" would entail. Sovern said at the time that the details of the proposal would probably have to be worked out by faculty members and that the faculties of both schools would have to approve any plan. Generally, a proposal that affects the College curriculum is discussed in the COI before it is brought to the full faculty for a vote."
239,Music Humanities,Feedback Smit issues call to arms for unilateral coed CC,24 September 1981,"Smit issues call to arms for unilateral coed CCTo the Editor: The Spectator performed an outstanding service to the Columbia community by publishing the Breslow report on the admission of women to the College. Amidst the present confusions and uncertainties its publication served as a welcome reminder of the real purpose of the Report itself, as well as of the College Faculty resolution on this matter. That purpose was above all the enlargement of the dangerously dwindling poof of high quality applicants and consequently the admission of women to the College. Improvement of the social atmosphere through a greater female presence in classes and dormitories, although evidently desirable in itself, was seen only as one of the means to achieve an increase of the applicant pool. An enlargement of the College through a merger with Barnard, wholesale or restricted to the core program, was definitely not what the Faculty voted for. In the Faculty meeting, as in the Report, the general mood was one of respect for Barnard's independence in pursuing its own educational mission, of willingness to maintain or increase the present level of cooperation, but it was unambiguously stated that closer relations with Barnard could not serve as a substitute for the admission of women to the College. Bits and pieces of information, however, seem to indicate that the Administration is pursuing exactly what the Faculty so emphatically rejected: a restricted merger, which will contribute absolutely nothing towards solving the critical problem of size and quality of the applicant pool. Since the Administration has not taken the trouble to explain the premises and details of its policy, it remains puzzling what exactly it is trying to achieve. One thing is certain: if Low Library only wants to increase the count of female bodies in the classrooms it would have been much cheaper to go and rent themat Times Square; that would certainly have been less destructive to the curriculum. The financial and logistical implications of the Administration's plans are staggering and will end up, one way or the other, in the destruction of the College's core curriculum and, possibly, the demise of whatever characterizes the Barnard- curriculum as well. Elementary arithmetic shows that the addition of 550 to 600 Barnard students to the core courses will necessitate an increase of the number of sections in all four core programs by 30 each, if the Administration wants to provide the teaching staff through the hiring of Assistant Professors, this would require 40 to 45 new appointements (15 in C.C., 15 in Humanities, 15 for Art and Music Humanities, all of them teaching two sections). One can safely assume that this is not what Low Library has in mind. It is rather cavalierly assumed that Barnard will share part of the teaching burden. One should realize then, that Barnard's curriculum and student-teacher ratio were never organized around the concept of across-the-board smallsection teaching of an extensive core program. Consequently Barnard will have to dismantle its most valuable programs in order to free instructional time for the core program, or leave this task to the Columbia faculty. If one wants to avoid hiring new Assistant Professors or dismantling the Barnard program, these seem still two options open. One is that of hiring graduate students, who are extensively used in the present set-up. This option, however, will not be available because of the decline in the number and quality of the applicants to the Graduate School. An example: this year one section of C.C. had to be dropped; two others could be filled only at the last moment because I twisted the arms of two talented graduate students to stay on for one more year. The other option is that of hiring part-timers outside the University. Although there are certainly some qualified people out there, this route would end up destroying the coherence and esprit de corps of the staff, which alone make the program work at the moment. Hiring academic flotsam and jetsam to staff the core curriculum would degrade it in no time into the equivalent of N.Y.U. or New School extension courses. ' It should be clear then, that, apart from many other considerations of equal importance, the financial implications of the Administration's plans alone spell disaster for the College's curriculum. Without any doubt, if this ill-considered plan goes through, and the impossibility of staffing the core courses becomes clear, the unavoidable effect will be the transformation of C.C. and Humanities into large lecture courses, destroying what constitutes the unique quality of the Columbia College education, i.e., the discussion group format of the core curriculum classes. And to what purpose? The only purpose I can see is the need to find a compromise. But it is a compromise nobody has asked for and which seems to have imposed itself only because of the way the negotiations have drifted along. Our hope is that an alliance of students, alumni and faculty will care enough about the College to defeat the kind of proposals we may soon expect. And if the Barnard faculty is as serious now as it was in the past about the preservation of the Barnard identity, it also will vote against the destruction of what their school stands for. This letter is meant as a call to arms. Together with alumni and students we should be able to bring the discussion back to the point we should not have strayed from: the implementation of the Breslow report and the Faculty resolution on the admission of women.

241,Music Humanities,Columbia hates music,22 February 1982,"By SEBASTIAN M. GLUCKEvery year, Columbia teaches several hundred students to loathe music with a passion. On top of that, they discourage the development of musical talent and leave the undergraduate musical population with a feeling of frustration and bitter disgust. The problem begins with the Music Humanities requirement. The goal of this program is to teach students to appreciate music in all its forms through stylistic and historic investigation. Instead, we learn what ""monody"" is and can identify ""word painting"" by example. Why not knock us off our feet on the first day of class? Play us the end of Schmann's Third and blast us out of our seats! Make us want to learn more, and then play a snippet of the Machaut Mass so that we can appreciate the origins of the great literature, but please don't offend us with a boring fortnight of Gregorian Chant! Just make great music enticing! Students who went to conservatories during high school put their instruments away forever when they got here because there was no place to practice. Even if there had been facilities, there was no opportunity to perform. I've been told, ""Columbia is not a conservatory. You should have stayed at Juilliard."" I came here to get a fine education, and I have, but that does not mean that I should give up my spiritual existence as a musician. Try taking private music lessons through the university. You'll get one point of credit, but you'll pay for four. Why? I'm sure nobody has an acceptable explanation. Even if you decide to be taken in by that deal, where are you going to practice? Your room in Carman? Not if you don't want to be force-fed your basson by the unsympathetic evolutionary regressive who happens to share your bathroom. Millions have and will be spent on computer center, athletic facilities, television equipment, and Christmas lights for College Walk. So why are there no private practice rooms for instrumentalists? Whyisn't there a playable piano on campus? Columbia has one of the greatest pipe organs in the country, yet it is totally offlimits, and I have to give local churches $1200 of my annual food allowance for practice time. Pretty damn grotesque, • isn't it? Oh, you say, Columbia offers plenty of performance opportunities. True, there isan orchestra that plays deservedly obscure music that nobody wishes to hear. What the heck is wrong with Mozart, Haydn, Brahms, and Mendelssohn? That's the kind of music that provides the most benefits for the student musicians and the audience— the great literature that we should have learned to appreciate in theclassroom. Hats off to the Philharmonia, who are valiantly trying to save us from musical oblivion! At this point I would have liked to discuss the process of getting funds for a student chamber orchestra, but the thought of mentally re-experiencing the contemptible attitudes of the bureaucrats involved simply makes me ill. Assuming that somehow people cared enough around here to establish facilities and actually gave musicians the opportunity to perform, where would they do so? We have no concert hall, although some of the country's ""lesser"" institutions have at least three. Try to picture the McMillin Theatre without getting depressed. A few concerts actually do get publicized and performed on campus, and the musical population of the undergraduate actually forms a good percentage of the audience. This mutual moral support community arises out of the fear that we will lose our sanity along with our aesthetic sensibilities. But how many professors show up? How many music professors? Why aren't there monthly faculty concerts so that we can have some kind of musical role model? If Columbia sincerely believes that music should be a part of our education it should seriously reevaluate its approach. The university could hire all the brilliant musicians for whom there was no room on the Juilliard faculty, and could have one of the greatest music departments n the world. Columbia already .has its own distinguished faculty, but few college students care to investigate the depart- ~ ment's offerings because their initial experience with music at Columbia was such „ a horror. - Columbia has.one chance to let each student appreciate great musici One chance. Ninety percent of the time, they blow that chance. And they lose that student forever. Sebastian M. Gluck. a senior in the college, is a concert organist. He is currently building a new organ for the Bethany Lutheran Church of Elmhurst.Opinion"
242,Music Humanities,BC group will study academics,23 February 1982,"By KATE SCHAEFERDelayed by the coed talks, a major review of the Barnard curriculum—focusing on distribution requirements and the possible adoption of core courses—will begin next week, Dean of Faculty Charles Olton said yesterday. Barnard's special curriculum review commmittee will also discuss general academic policy, because while the Committee on Instruction serves as a ""watchdog for regulations"" and departments determine their own major requirements, there is ""no watchdog for general education,"" said Olton, chairman of the review panel. ""There have been doubts and unhappiness about the distribution concept,"" he said. There has also been discussion at Barnard of instituting a math requirement, a writing course beyond freshman composition and a computer literacy requirement. During the talks, Barnard offered to accept the College's core curriculum of Contemporary Civilization and Literature, Art, and Music Humanities in an effort to achieve ""de facto coeducation."" Olton said the curriculum review must be completed and implemented by the fall of 1983, when the College begins admitting women. One of the first items the committee must address is a mechanism for student input into the review, he added.To implement changes in fall 1983 the committee would have to finish its work a year from now so any changes could be fit into the 1983-84 budget, Olton said. To finance the changes, Barnard could either redistribute its resources or seek grants from foundations, he said. But, he cautioned, ""we can't just expect to spend more money."" The four members of the committee elected by the full faculty are Joann Morse, professor of English, Flora Davidson, assistant professor of political science, Renee Green, professor of French,and Bernice Segal, professor of chemistry. They each represent one of the four sections of the Barnard faculty: foreign languages, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Olton said President Futter then appointed three members of the committee to ""create balance which elections don't create."" The most glaring omission, he said, was that there were no men elected to the committee.Futter appointed Hubert Doris, a music professor, because the humanities representative was from the English department, he said. Duncan Foley, chairman fo the economics department, was chosen because Futtter wanted at least one committee member to come from a department that had strong ties to its Columbia counterpart, he said. History professor Robert Mc-Caughey was also selected. There will also be two members—Sally Chapman, assistant professor of chemistry, and Virginia Zelizer, assistant professor of sociology—serving as liasons to the COI. Ex officio members are Futter, Wendy Fairey, associate dean of the faculty,' and VilmaBornemann, dean for academic services. Other faculty members will be asked to address the committtee, which will also bring in academics from outside Barnard and seek advice from both public and private high school administrators, Olton said."
243,Music Humanities,Feedback Music department answers charges in article,24 March 1982,"Music department answers charges in articleTo the Editor: On page 6 of the Feb. 22 issue of Spectator, Sebastian Gluck goes to some lengths to assert—in the words of the title of his piece—that ""Columbia hates music."" His remarks about music at Columbia boil down to three topics: 1. Facilities and Opportunities for Music-Making by Students and Faculty: Mr. Gluck is right about the inadequacy of practice rooms and of McMillin Theatre, and we thank him for adding his voice to ours. For at least ten years the successive Chairmen of the music department (including both of the signers of this response) have been beseeching, imporing, urging andinsisting, in various reports and budget requests, that practice rooms with pianos be provided by the university in addition to the four cubicles that now serve all the undergraduate and graduate music students. We have received no response. McMillin Theatre, Columbia's only large auditorium, is shamefully inadequate in equipment and maintenance. The music department has been asking the university administration for a decade to make at least the basic improvements necessary to render McMillin Theatre suitable for concert-giving, and above all to engage a professional theater manager to supervise the running of the theater. The only improvements that have been made have been the painting of the peeling auditorium (but not of the peeling lobby) and the replacement of the torn carpet (but not of the tornstage curtain). We also agree that it is unrealistic for the university to charge for private instrumental instruction or chamber music at the rate of four points per semester. Even though for several years we have been writing, calling and talking to various administrators, explaining that the system was stifling a valuable program, the matter continues to be in abeyance. Mr. Gluck complains about the inaccessibility of the organ in St. Paul's Chapel. The music department has nothing to say about the running of St. Paul's Chapel, but one of us (the Director of Music Performance) has heard Sebastian Gluck in public concert there with two Barnard students during his freshman year. (He played very well.) What he or others have done since then to have the organ declared off limits is for those in-volved with the administration of the Chapel to say. But it is incomprehensible for him to speak as though other student musicians have no performance opportunities and as though he could not have them if he sought them. Surely he knows that the Music Performance Program has already presented hundreds of students in chamber music performances in the few years since its inception. There is at least one public concert each semester, usually with three to five student ensembles in a concert, and the Music Performance Program of the music department sees to itthat these ensembles are organized, coached in weekly sessions by appropriate faculty artists, given rooms to rehearse in and finally presented in concert in a suitable public place such as the Philosophy Hall Lounge or the Barnard Parlor which make attractive concert locales. The Barnard music department, moreover, which is integrated with the Columbia music department, offers student performers a platform in its frequent ""Music for an Hour"" concerts. The BarnardColumbia Chorus gives stimulating programs each year.The music department's Collegium Musicum involves both graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in performing music of earlier times, such as Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music. And the Columbia Composers, an official student-run activity of the music department, presents music composed by Columbia students and uses Columbia players who can handle the complexities of new music, in combination with conservatory students or young professionals from outside the university. Mr. Gluck complains that the University Orchestra plays music ""that nobody wishes to hear,"" instead of ""Mozart, Haydn, Brahms, and Mendelssohn."" But the University Orchestra, consisting of more than 60 students, who work regularly together in reading sessions, rehearsals, and concerts has played during the past few seasons all the composers he mentions—and lots of others that he surely would want to include in his pantheon of ""greats,"" such as Handel, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Berlioz, Dvorak and Mahler. We don't limit ourselves, however, to SebastianGluck's list of ""the great literature."" The University Orchestra and the faculty artists also play and study the composers of our own time and place—Chou Wen-chung, Vladimir Ussachevsky, Jack Beeson, George Edwards, Max Lifchitz and Maurice Wright of Columbia, as well as William Schuman, Samuel Barber, Dominick Argento, Elliott Carter, Ezra Laderman. . . 2. Music Humanities: We quote parts of two sentences from a lengthy departmental report ot Dean Collery of December 20,1978, concerning the Music Humanities course: ""Its aim continues to be to develop the students' critical perception of and articulate response to Western art music. . .The proselytizing nature of the course guarantees a percentage of failures. . .but as long as we can claim—as we do at present —that. . .individual students continue to be 'turned on,' the course justifies itself."" We have always been convinced that variance in content, quality and work load in a course given in twenty or more sections can be eliminated only at the price of regimentation. Necessarily, the greatest emphasis in a course of this sort will on music since, say, 1700. Even though one of the undersigned happens to be a medievalist, he himself is quite persuaded that he need not mention the name of Machaut; but a presentation of the most important conceptual principles of Medieval and Renaissance music—with examples—is necessary and consonant with the educational philosophy on which Columbia's core courses are based. Incidentally, Music Hum doesn'tleed to start with the end of Schumann's Third—or with anyone's favorite composition. Many people start with Gregorian chant—it makes good sense—some do clever tricks of one sort or another. (One instructor has started with dropping a chair on the floor to get the fundamental distinction between noise and pitch out of the way first.) 3. The Nature of the Department, and of Its Undergraduate Instruction: Mr.Gluck's attitude toward Music Humanities (and his particular section) as well as his suggestion that the university ""could have one of the greatest music departments in the world"" by hiring ""all the brilliant musicians for whom there was no room on the Juilliard faculty"" show not only that his notion of Music Hum is out of focus, but that he really seems to want a conservatory approach to music. We have always insisted that our primary education obligation to music majors is the shaping of unspecialized literate musicians within the framework of Columbia's liberal arts education. Any student who is sufficiently dedicated, energetic and quick of mind to keep up a high level of musical performance (voice or instrument), while majoring in music, has our fervent admiration and encouragement. But music literacy doesn't depend on superior musical technique; we all know that the latter too often is linked with the absence of the former. All of us love to perform (privately or publicly) whenever there's enough opportunity for practicing. But one should also keep in mind old Brahms's significant statement that ""the best performance I heardwas when I read the score."" We can't strive for that level of musical literacy in Music Humanities students, but we do aim for it in our highly demanding program for music majors. Had Mr. Gluck been an open-minded music major in this department, he would not be leaving Columbia with the same conventional tastes, preferences and prejudices with which he entered and which presumably don't limit him in fields other than music.

244,Music Humanities,Music professors gave Spec a bum rap,31 March 1982,"To the Editor; I just finished reading the response of the music department last week to Sebastian Gluck's criticisms (Spectator, March 24). As a junior in the College, I have gotten over my original anger and frustration at the Columbia bureaucracy, but the irresponsibility and insults emanating from the university officials continues to amaze me. Their letter does deserve a response, though, if only because it represents much of what is wrong with Columbia. Although I am not a musician, I have taken Music Humanities and do know a few things about thebureaucracy here. At the beginning of the department's response, we are told how several officials have been ""beseeching, imploring, and urging"" the university for years to change things. Of course, if you asked Michael Sovern he would be in favor of the changes too. So would the students. The housing office tells us how it would like to change things; so do people in the bursar's office, professors, and administrators. Everyone is in favor of improvements, yet nothing changes. The only conclusion I can reach is that no one is responsiblefor the way things are, and thus everyone is irresponsible. Not satisfied with its limp defense of the department, the authors resort to ad hominum attacks against Mr. Gluck. They insinuate that he is responsible for ""breaking"" the organ in St. Paul's chapel and thus having it placed off-limits to students. Later they state that Mr. Gluck is closedminded, with ""conventional tastes and prejudices that limit him."" Such attacks are cheap and more becoming to a third-rate demagogue than a university official. They should be taken back.Later, the authors attempt to defend the Music Humanities course. From my experience and those of my friends, it is hard to tell from the professor's remarks if they have ever been in a Music Hum class. ""The greatest emphasis in a class of this sort,"" they write, ""will be on music since, say, 1700."" I guess that explains who one class spent six weeks on Gregorian chants. Unlike the Art Humanities orientation, only a secondary attempt is made in Music Hum to expose non-music students to a wide variety of Western music and to provide a background that is useful to them. Instead, theory is emphasized, which is very difficult and of little use to those of us whose talents don't incline in this direction. Whatever great music a student is exposed to and learns about happens by accident; in the process of learning theory you hear pieces that you like. At least in Art Hum they don't try to make us painters, but try to make us able to enjoy art as a non-artist. It is almost a universal complaint at Columbia that while CC and Lit Hum are good and useful courses and Art Hum is a pleasant surprise, Music Hum is a disappointment. This course needs to be restructured, and quoting from self-written and self-congratulatory departmental reports does nothing to further this goal. Music Hum is out of focus. No, Columbia does not hate music. It just does little to encourage it. I am not shocked or surprised, just disappointed and disillusioned. David Krentel College '83"
245,Music Humanities,What's your degree worth?,30 August 1982,"By TODD BRESSIWARNING! Read this before you go to the bursar's office to pay your bill. You might be A four-year stint at Columbia now runs upwards of $50,000—and that's assuming costs of tuition, room and board will not go up any more. When you realize you will be walking away from commencement into a job that will probably pay less than $20,000 a year (if ydu aren't going to graduate school) you may begin to wonder just how much your education is P' ■■■■■■:.. Vnotes, American society does not pay extra for people who know a lot about Homer, Herodotus and Plato. College and porary Civilization and humanities core do not translate directly into more dollars or guarantee a job. Students, considering how they can best get a job in the creaking 14 „. economy, realize that liberal arts degrees ale*/t not especially rewarded by society and IN that standard view them less and less as prac| tical. That has meant tough times for many liberal arts schools—and is beginning to raealj I tough times for theHMMfcts themselves. H 1But university officials —and others—argue that the picture is not that bleak for undergraduate liberal arts majors. Says Joe O'Steen, a placement officer in the university's office of Placement Services, the economy might be just right for the liberal arts major. ""The economy in the U.S. demands sophisticated people as managers, sophisticated in the sense they've experienced a lot of things and can deal with a wide variety of people."" And, he says, ""the simplest way of getting that sophistication is a broad liberal arts education."" O'Steen explains that it is easier for a company to hire somebody trained in a profession such as engineering, journalism or business because it knows what background thatperson has and what his capabilities are at the entry level. But, he continues, the specialization and narrow focus of a ""vocational"" bachelor's degree can be a handicap. ""When it comes to jobs that are not quantifiable, testable or measurable, a company has to rely on its judgement. It will pick a person with broad experience on the assumption that he can learn almost anything. ""Employers don't care what you majored in as long as you did well and did not overspecialize,"" he says. One student looks at it in a slightly different way: ""All other things being equal, then it matters what you major in. But I don't believe in 'all other things being equal,' and let me tell you, Fve seen idiots majoring in professional programs,and I've seen idiots who are majoring in the liberal arts. It doesn't matter what you major in, as long as you aren't an idiot."" At last year's College Class Day, three career counsellors spoke to parents—one who deals with pre-meds, one who deals with pre-laws and O'Steen. Many parents, he says, are just as worried as their children about whether there will be jobs for liberal arts majors. At Class Day, he recounts, ""somebody asked me 'What's the most practical major?' and I answered, 'English, maybe.'"" That, he said, drew laughter. Then someone asked why, and I said because it's about people,"" he continues. ""Then someone asked, 'What's the next most practical major?'"" And, laughing as he anticipates the typical response to the answer he is going to give to that question, he says, his reply: ""Philosophy.""The College's Rosenthal contends that job marketability or salary bonuses are the wrong criterion for measuring a liberal arts degree. ""Liberal arts study ought to be justified by the act itself,"" he says. ""Can you live without it? Sure. Can you get ahead in life without having read Homer and taken music? Sure. But it is an inner resource that is terribly vital, and it seems to me, there are, if you want to look at it that way, proven consequences"" of having a liberal arts education. But this attitude is criticized by some who say liberal arts schools are playpens for the rich, and that academics who design courses instill a set of values upon art and culture that are essentially elitist. Some students criticize music humanities, for example, for placing too much emphasis on Western ""art music"" and for not giving enough attention to folk and regional art. Rosenthal contends that ""elitism"" is a ""code word"" and that the implications of it are not clear. ""Of course it is elitist to go to the College to study the Iliad. But higher education of any sort is obviously a distinct experience from what the world at large has access to.""Still, these words are not of encouragement to the exliberal arts students still pounding the streets looking for jobs, and perhaps not even to those still in school—even (especially) English and philosophy majors. Things just don't seem quite that easy and many of them are turning to professional schools, notably law and business, because they believe it is through them thatjobs will be eaiser to get—and much more financially rewarding. O'Steen admits that jobfinding is not easy, especially for the liberal arts major, and that liberal arts majors tend to have the toughest time finding a job in tight economic times. But, he notes, vocational and professional majors do not necessarily have an advantage in tough times. ""If you come out with a Bachelor's in education and live in the Northeast, you're in trouble. ""A liberal arts graduate has to use good judgement to find a job. It will not sit around and fall in his lap,"" he warns, adding that not many liberal arts majors get their jobs through on-campus recruiting. . When O'Steen says a com-pany will look for somebody with a ""broad education,"" he qualifies that to mean more than a broad formal education and include job and extracurricular experience. When considering a job applicant, employers consider, among other things, whether he has worked before and held the job, what else he has done besides school and work, whether he has held leadership positions and whether he is motivated to do things. A good job candidate must be able to read, write clearly, make presentations, analyze and calculate—just the things for which a liberal arts education can provide training. Rosenthal says that even if more and more students define what they want to learn by utilitarian standards, schools"
246,Music Humanities,CC asks SEAS to drop its core requirements,4 October 1982,"By RICHARD FROEHLICHThe College has asked the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to reexamine its requirement that students take some of the the College core courses and consider instead having a general nontechnical requirement. College officials said that if the SEAS policy were not changed it would force an increase in the number of Literature Humanities sections, but they warned that the program was already nearly so large as to be unmanageable. James Mirollo, chairman of the Lit Hum program, said if plans to increase the College class size go through, the situation would get worse. There are already 50 Lit Hum sections, he said. Moreover, Michael Rosenthal, college associate dean, said he is not sure ""whetherit makes sense"" for SEAS students to be required to only take part of the core curriculum instead of any particular, ""successful non-technical"" course. Engineers must now take either Lit Hum or CC and either Music Humanities or Art Humanities, but Rosenthal said he asked the SEAS to reconsider its policy—which is three years old. Ralph Schwarz, vice dean of the SEAS, said that the school would reconsider its policy in response to the College request but that he could not promise when it would be brought up because it was reviewed so recently. He added that he understood the concern over the problems in staffing Lit Hum sections but that any SEAS decision would not be based on ""that kind of problem."" Schwarz said when the school ""recentlyreexamined"" the program requirements of freshmen and sophomores, it ""reaffirmed that the best courses were Lit Hum and CC."" He added that the requirement was changed three years ago to make sure students take a full year of CC or Lit Hum. Previously students had to take any two semesters of the six semester core curriculum series, according to Fred Post, chairman of the Engineering Student Council. That change in SEAS policy has caused particular problems with Lit Hum because a surprisingly high percentage of engineers take it instead of CC and put ""pressure on the number of sections and section size,"" according to Mirollo. Post said he did not ""see the rationale for making the core classes requirements forCollege students and not engineers."" Rosenthal answered that claim by saying the core was designed to be taken as a whole group of four classes and that the core is meant to help give direction to College students in choosing a major. But Post countered that it was ""more essential for engineers—to help them find out what they want to do""—whether to stay in the SEAS or to transfer to a liberal arts program. That, he said, is ""a more critical decision than what major"" SEAS students will pursue. Mirollo said there was validity in the argument that the core should not be taken separately. ""They are taking a piece of what is conceived as a package. But the piece does not have the total effect of the package,"" he explained.James Parker, SEAS dean of students, said that when the decision was made three years ago to expand the requirements, there was not a ""concern of taking part of the core curriculum and not the whole."" Mirollo added he ""would hate to see someone not have to take it"" but at this point he was more persuaded by the practical aspect of the pressure on the sections."
247,Music Humanities,Some suggestions for Lit Hum,21 October 1982,"To the editor: Every year the Literature Humanities staff debates vehemently over the required reading list, with some professors advocating this or that book, according to their own personal tastes. The required texts remain essentially the same each year—lliad, Aeneid, Republic, Gargantua and Pantagruel, Gulliver's Travels—but there are usually some minor changes. I have a strong recommendation when the staff will discuss the reading list for 1983: Why not include Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye? With the College going coeducational and supposedly making adequate preparations for the transi-tion, it is absurd that among the twenty-five books forming the syllabus, not one of them was written by a female author. Are we to believe that female writers are incapable of producing great works of literature? The achievements of George Eliot and Jane Austen, I think, contradict this silly notion. How about including Pride and Prejudice to the required reading (or, at least, making it an available option)? This novel contains marvelous use of satire, irony, and narration; not to mention some basic themes emphasized in Literature Humanities—knowledge through suffering, deception of first impressions, love conquers all, human flaw of excessive pride... Jane Austen's novel is unques-tionably a ""classic,"" presenting a woman's viewpoint of English society, where we have inherited so much of our cultural richness. More important, the course has been severely criticized for its Western bias, and we should not allow it to be vulnerable to the attacks of male chauvinism. My second suggestion is to add Catcher in the Rye to the reading list. There will, of course, be formidable opposition. Some critics would hardly consider it a ""classic."" In its defense, I would like to point out that it is perhaps the most popular American novel since World War 11, especially among college students, and that it has received enormous critical praise. Others will condemn Sal-inger's book on account of its vulgar language. Is it, however, any worse than Rabelais's vivid description of human sexual and excretory functions? I think not. Literature Humanities should encourage discussions. Too often though, many students are overwhelmed with the instructor's knowledge of the books that they are intimidated to express their opinions. With Catcher in the Rye, however, the instructor may learn more from the students than the students from the instructor, since the protagonist is a young but precocious adolescent, who criticizes the hypocrisy of modern American society. Imagine the interesting and lively class discussions with this novel! In his inaugural address President Michael Sovern said: ""But it is on her common journey with modern man that Columbia finds her greatest reason for being."" In Art Humanities we study modern art, and in Music Humanities we listen to recent 20th century music, but in Literature Humanities westop somewhere in the 1860's. Literature Humanities should include a late 20th century work such as Catcher in the Rye because students should also learn to appreciate present literature. Since the course is presented in a chronological order, Salinger's novel must be the last reading, which many students will not bother to read because they are inundated with term papers and busy studying for finals. Catcher in the Rye, enjoyable and easily readable, will encourage more students to read the final book and to attend the last few discussions. Literature Humanities should make the students appreciate great works of literature, and the addition of Pride and Prejudice and Catcher in the Rye will enhance the already excellent course. I hope that the Literature Humanities staff will seriously consider these texts when it plans to make the 1983 reading list.

248,Music Humanities,Profs defend core as 'timeless',2 December 1982,"By LISA FAILER""The texts speak of the things that are timeless,"" said Professor of English James Mirollo, chairman of the Literature Humanities department. ""Life, love, death and hate."" ""Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization civilized me,"" said Dean of the College Robert Pollack, a 1961 graduate of the College. But the College's four required core courses that deal with the allegedly ""timeless"" works of civilization—Contemporary Civilization and Literature, Music and Art Humanities—have been criticized for their failure to include either modern works or works by women in their curricula.Although the Music and Art Humanities courses do allow for some study of modern works, most Literature Humanities sections end at Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, written in the latter part of the 19th century. And Contemporary Civilization instructors are asked to teach only one ""modern"" (20th Century) text of their choice in addition to the required books, which generaly end with a work by Sigmund Freud. Thus students reading about 50 texts in the two courses may only read two books written after 1900—and no books by women. Complaints that the core is sexually biased because it lacks works by women have stepped up since the College's announcement that it would admit womennext year. Women authors of high caliber, from Sappho to Jane Austen to many writers of this century, merit a place in the core curriculum, protestors claim. But College administrators and instructors in all courses said the core could never be temporally or sexually biased, because its traditional works are ""timeless"": its curricula have the capacity to respond to contemporary issues as they arise. The texts, they contend, present strands of thought that surface in everything else we read, thus serving as documents of this historical and continuing development of our culture. Others maintain that if the core ad-dresses ""all students' needs"" it becomes a survey course imbued with ""automatic superficiality."" Students can gain access to more contemporary works and works by women in other courses, faculty members said. Mechanical problems such as a lack of time for faculty to consider curricular additions and the difficulty of reaching staff consensus about which modern or womenauthored works to include also inhibit changes in the core, instructors and administrators said. Rather than representing all aspects of cultural history by including specific texts, the core should teach a ""common frame of reference and language"" that ""provides bridges of a sort between people that are intrinsically more valuable than those that are built by everyone watching baseball,"" said Deborah Goldberg, assistant professor of philosophy and a Contemporary Civilization instructor. Faculty members said the core provided students with this common ""vocabulary"" because the issues the courses raised could bedirectly related to contemporary developments—and to the changing student himself. ""The core curriculum is like the American Constitution,"" said Assistant Professor of English Peter Rudnytsky, a Literature Humanities teacher. ""Its permanence is assured by its capacity to accept gradual change."" ""We try to relate works to contemporary concerns,"" said Goldberg. ""From 1968-72 it looked like Thuycidides was teaching what happened on the Columbia College campus yesterday,"" said Professor of English Wallace Gray, a Literature Humanities instructor. ""It was like reading Spectator."" Although Music Humanities, Art Humanities and Contemporary Civilization do incorporate analyses of some modern works or ""leave room"" for them at the end of the syllabus, instructors of those courses agreed that deciding which works to include was extremely difficult. ""You're not going to have agreement among a staff of 46 as to what is a canonical text of today,"" saidPeter Pouncey, professor of classics and chairman of the Contemporary Civilization department. ""After 1933, I don't see any pattern of what should be taught,"" said Laurence Dickey, assistant professor of history and a Contemporary Civilization instructor. ""It's too early to tell what's fad and trendy."" Likewise, Literature Humanities does not deal with any works written after the 19th century. Gray said the course's syllabus had remained ""about 95 percent the same"" since he began teaching the course in 1953. Gray, who has gained campuswide popularity through his modern literature course, ""Eliot, Joyce and Pound,"" said he thought the addition of modern texts to the syllabus was not necessary. ""As long as you continue to relate the text to the students, the course will always be fluid,"" he said. ""It's not a frozen chorus."" Mirollo agreed. ""Aristotle lays out all the fundamental moral problems,"" he said. ""He answers questions from, 'Should I jumpover the turnstile without putting in a token?' to 'What is the good life?' "" Life in the College classroom will change next fall—and the anticipated presence of women has prompted discussion of alternative approaches to conducting the course. Most of these discussions center on new teaching techniques, rather than the addition of new works to accomodate women. Because women and therefore their creative attempts have been ""buried"" by a ""history which is a history of men,"" they could not author the type of ""masterwork"" that belongs on a core syllabus, said Goldberg. ""I don't think it's honest to make women appear more important in whatever kind of development than they are,"" said one Music Humanities instructor. ""I don't see why anyone should be embarrassed about that. It has to do with the accessability they had to training and the lives they lived."" ""Their talent was supposed to be limited to the domestic scene,"" said Professor of Music JoelNewman, chairman of Music Humanities. Although men and women faculty members agree that the College should not add a ""token"" work by a woman to the core, they disagree about whether an embellished ""feminist perspective"" should be consciously integrated into class discussions as an alternative. The calls for such a change reflect that something ""central"" has been ""left out"" previously ""simply because no one has been insisting that you teach it,"" Goldberg said. ""What a man needs to know and what a woman needs to know aren't different,"" she noted. But Howard McP. Davis, professor of Art History and an Art Humanities instructor since 1955, said that he did not believe he would have to alter his approach when women arrive because ""I already discuss the presentation of women in art."" ""Having more women in (Art) Humanities will only change the tone of the classroom,"" Davis said. Susan Tholl, a preceptor of art history teaching another Art Humanities section, agreed. ""The course will change of its own nature,"" she said. Faculty members said the purpose of Literature Humanities was to educate the ""whole"" individual regardless of the student's sex—by making the monuments touchable; by emphasizing that great works were created by real people ""and therefore were not perfect. ""I constantly encourage students to criticize the text,"" said Gray, ""by asking them 'Why don't you object to the work? Why can't you find what's wrong with the work?'"" ""There will remain and must remain * a variety of individual perspectives brought to bear on the works we read,"" said Rudnytsky. ""Literature Humanities is one course and 50 courses because each instructor will touch works in a different way."" But Professor of English Matthew Wikander, a Literature Humanities instructor, also emphasized the social role of the course. Students not only devleop, their perceptions of themselves and their world but receive a sense of ""shared"" experience with others who have and will take the course, he noted. ""Alumni sing the praises of Humanities,"" Wikander said. ""The core curriculum creates a solidarity—its a shared ordeal. It gives students a sense of the past—they now see that the chaos, confusion and weirdness that they are seeing around them has held a basic continuity through the ages. ""They're trying to engage the same issues—what is life and whether it has meaning.""SPECTATOR/ED KEATING Robert Pollack . . . civilize me"
249,Music Humanities,"CC for BC at CC is OK, say Barnard students",18 February 1983,"By TOVA COHENBarnard students are taking College core curriculum courses in increasing numbers and consider them among the most valuable courses they've taken, although some found sexism in their professors and fellow students. James Mirollo, Professor of English and Comparative Literature and chairman of Literature Humanities, said yesterday that 15 Lit Hum sections have had to be added because ""there has been a steady rise over the last few years"" in the number of Barnard women. He said there are currently 300 women from Barnard and the School of Engineering and Applied Science in Lit Hum, though neither Mirollo nor the Barnard registrar's office could provide exact figures about the number of women in all of the core courses. All of the Barnard students interviewed this week recommended that every Barnard student take C.C. or Lit Hum. Debbie Farbman, a Barnard sophmore taking Lit Hum said, ""I think it's phenomenal. Everyone with a liberal arts education should take it."" ""It's like knowing the alphabet. You should know the works,"" said Megan Watt, a freshman taking Lit Hum. ""I think the core is one of thebest things the College has to offer,"" said sophomore Tracy Teicher, who is also taking Lit Hum. ""The Columbia professors are some of the best and Barnard's can't compare."" Yet Teicher said she thought her professor, whose name she did not want to mention, exhibited some sexism, pointedly questioning her and other women about why they did not participate in class discussions. ""Some teachers have a tendency to put the women down even though they have respect for them for taking these hard classes whenthey don't have to,"" she said. Sophomore Peggy Hong said she felt self-conscious at first in her Lit Hum class, which had two other women in it, but said it didnt't take her long to get used to being in ' a male dominated class."" Hong said, however, that her female teacher ""felt self-conscious about teaching girls, and the girls were noticed if they were absent or if they spoke up."" Other students said there was no sexism shown by their teachers or by the Columbia men in their classes, nor did they think the courses were adversely affected by not having women authors on the syllabus. ""It's not a matter of teaching women writers. How many female Greek writers were there then?"" asked Watt. ""There are other courses that give a better view of women writers, if that's what you want."" Yet every Barnard student complained that C.C. did not fulfill the school's distribution requirement. ""It makes me so angry. I think it's just prejudice. C.C. should at least fulfill a requirement and Lit Hum should be counted toward a major such as English or Program in the Arts,"" said Hong. And few students said they thought Barnard should force its students to take C.C. and Lit Hum, as valuable as the courses are. Julie Rosenfeld, a freshman taking CC, said she wouldn't like to take a course like Music Humanities, for example. ""I like Barnard's distribution method better,"" she said."
250,Music Humanities,Blacks have rough time with CU's white climate,25 April 1983,"By SUSAN SCHEINERBlack undergraduates at Columbia, who comprise approximately six percent of the student population, have said minorities encounter many problems here including increasing low minority enrollment, and a white-oriented curriculum and social atmosphere. Black student leaders interviewed this semester said that efforts must be made to increase the university's minority enrollment. Nationwide, ten percent of all college students are black. Stacy Cumberbatch, head of the Barnard Organization of Black Women, said she believes a minority recruitment committee is necessary to increase minority presence on campus. Black student leaders also stressed the importance of need-blind admissions policy, observing that minority students would be the ones hit hardest by its discontinuation. Moreno Orlandi, head of the Black Students Organization, described entrance into Columbia for some black freshmen as ""culture shock,"" especially those from all-black neighborhoods. Orlandi added that it can be ""a strange feeling"" as the only black student in a classroom. Keith Cockrell, head of the National Society of Black Engineers, said that minority students must make greater adjustments to college life than white students. He pointed out that while whites may feel comfortable in an academic atmosphere, the situation is a new one for many black students. ""This period entails a mental change"" on the part of the balck student, Cockrell said. ""He must maintain a positive image of himself in the white environment, and he must try to stay in, in spite of the culture shock,"" he added. The black student at Columbia must deal with what some consider omissions in the curriculum. Cumberbatch cited a general absence within the curriculum of black contributions in differentfields, and Orlandi said he felt the need for the ""recognition of black culture at Columbia."" For example, Orlandi noted the exclusion of jazz from the Music Humanities syllabus and of early African civilizations from Columbia's famed Contemporary Civilization course. While other schools have entire departments devoted to AfroAmerican studies. Columbia has only an occasional history or political science course relating to black culture. Asian studies and Jewish studies courses exist at Columbia, he said, yet Afro-American studies are generally neglected. The lack of black faculty at Columbia is another concern that minority students have expressed. Of the approximately 290 tenured professors in the arts and science faculty of Columbia, three are black while at Barnard and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, there are no tenured black faculty. Cockrell said, ""Blacks have not entered in all levels in the university."" In a large institution, where student-professor contact is often limited, black students said it is especially difficult to find role models among the faculty. This may perpetuate the existing situation wha black student who fails to find a ""mentor"" in the faculty is less likely to choose a career in academia for himself. Black students encounter problems around campus as well, black representatives have said. Orlandi said that black male students are asked for identification by security guards more often than whites which creates ""friction"" and ""leads to a feeling of alienation."" Wylie Burgan, chairman of the United Minority Board, an umbrella for minority organizations at Columbia, recounted an incident in which a guest of his was stopped in the dorm by a group of whitestudents. Burgan, who is also vicechairman of the Undergraduate Dorm Council, said in another instance security was alerted when a guest of Burgan's entered his dormitory. In light of the alienation many black students at Columbia may feel, extra-curricular activities are of key importance in making them feel more at home on campus, students said. However, said Cockrell, ""Concerts and speakers sponsored by the university are usually directed to a white audience."" Burgan added, ""The Board of Managers, supposedly for all students, doesn't focus enough on minority needs."" Orlandi said that black students may feel uneasy at the productions of the Student or Dormitory Councils or with the predominantly white social sceneat the Pub.Groups such as the Barnard Organization of Black Women and the Black Student Organization attempts to provide social, cultural and academic support for Hblack students. ""The BSO offers a social environment where black students having similar experiences, can meet,"" Orlaiidi said, adding that the organization also tries to raise awareness about black culture. Cockrell said that the National Society of 'Black Engineers, in addition to providing support for matriculated students, also tries to target qualified minority high school students and help them choose a career in engineering. Some students said that a certain degree of racial separation in the social life-exists at Columbia. There are black parties, they admitted, where a white might feel out of place, and white parties where a black student would not go to relax.Cumberbatch observed that Columbia is not particularly conducive to exchange between white and black students. ""It can't really be done in the classroom,"" she said, ""and on campus, considering the ration of black to white students, black students find it easier to stay with their established friends."" ""Separation is a fact,"" Orlandi said, but ""I don't look on it as bad."" Burgan however said that ""Segregation is caused by attitudes on both sides,"" and that ""Interaction is a vital part of a college education, but segregation is necessary for survival."" ""Students should work collectively to change this,"" he added. Reviewing the problems and issues black students face at the university, Cumberbatch concluded, ""Columbia is part of American society. It's not isolated."""
251,Music Humanities,Spectator Features Babbitt at Barnard Composer talks of music,29 October 1984,"Babbitt at BarnardComposer talks of musicBy MICHAEL LIEBOWITZOn Tuesday, October 30, the eminent American composer, Milton Babbitt, will inaugurate a series of lectures sponsored by the Barnard College Program in the Arts. Babbitt will speak in the R.M. Levine Distinguished Artist Series, which is funded by Barnard alumna, Rashelle Mutnick Levine. Babbit's lecture is entitled: ""On the Unlikely Survival of Serious Music."" Before discussing the meaning and purpose of Babbitt's lecture, I would like to describe briefly some notable achievements of the speaker. Born in 1916, Milton Babbitt has been instrumental in ramifyng the progressive growth of twelve-tone music and was an early experimenter in electronic music. His musical vita include the prizewinning Composition for Four Instruments, Composition for Viola and Piano, Three Compositions for Piano, a number of string quartets, and more recently, Ars Combinatoria (for small orchestra), The Head of the Bed (for soprano and four instruments) Groupwise (for flutist and four instruments), and Four Play (for four players). As well as being a prolific composer, Babbitt has also established himself as an important critic and theorist of serial music and the aesthetics of music. His articles have been printed in The Score and IMA Magazine, Perspective of New Music, and High Fidelity, to name a few publications. His literary compositions have also been printed in anthologies such as Perspectives on Contemporary Music Theory, Twentieth Century Views of Music History, Contemporary Composers on Contemporary Music, and Esthetics Contemporary. Babbitt's awards range from a Guggenheim Fellowship (1960-61) to a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation (1982); and he has been commissioned by prestigious organizations including the Ford Foundation, the New York Philharmonic Society, the Koussevitsky Music Foundation int he Library of Congress, and the Filene Center for the Performing Arts. He is presently William Shubael Conant Professor Emeritus at Princeton University and is on the Composition Faculty of The Juilliard School. Inherent in the text of his lecture will be several points on his views of ""serious"" music, the reasons for its demise, and the function of American composers and their music insociety. At first glance the title of the lecture appears a trifle cynical, for, many may consider popular musicians and groups such as Bob Dylan, Prince, and the Police, etc. as serious composers compposing serious music. And certainly popular music is not dying, but rather continually progressing with respect to changing musical ideas and popular tastes. Babbitt has an altogether different view: he considers himself ""utterly removed"" from the world of popular music. What, then, is ""serious"" music for Babbitt? ""Essentially serious music embodies those compositions that contain a- certain originality, a certain structural richness or complexity."" Of course, he is not referring to complexity or originality in its most superficial sense, for ""anyone can compose the first piece for three piccolos and two tubas, or a work of Mahlerian dimensions that is strung together with a massive sequence of musical events."" ""A serious work must be interesting and exciting in a way that it has never been heard before."" At bottom, the work, on first listening, should carry the listener along, presenting new ideas in such a ""highly contextual"" manner that farther listenings will expose deeper relationships within the work. Babbitt's notion of a ""highly contextual"" work basically refers to a composition that is ""self-contained."" Babbitt explains that ""a self-contained work is one that displays all of its musical properties in an original way. Therefore, when listening to the work for the first time, the listener cannot make any assumptions about or references to the work. The listener must start from scratch, for he is hearing something entirely hew, something completely independent of any music he has ever heard before."" Babbitt addresses the idea of originality as ""something that does not refer to a single aspect of the composition (for example, orchestration) but to the musical whole, the musical continuity, and the interrelation of musical properties."" Musical properties like orchestration, dynamics, pitch, and rhythm must function as a whole in the sense that everything is functional and necessary to the composition. Take any work by Webern. If one alters the dynamics, the instrumentation, or any aspect of the original work, the piece will be virtually unrecognizable. This is in contrast to the principle of musical function and necessity to a work of Back, for example. If one were to change the dynamics or even the instrumenation, one would still recognize the piece. (In many of Bach's works, dynamics were not written in, and therefore, this musical property can hardly be called necessary, but rather, expressive.) In the course of his lecture, Babbitt will discuss the ""practical, cultural, economic, and social"" reasons for the demise of serious music. In a recent interview about his musical views and his forthcoming talk, Babbitt outlined the basic premises of his argument. In practical terms, Babbitt laments that there is ""simply not enough time devoted to the preparation and production of a new, serious work with respect to the demands of the composer and his work."" He describes the New York Philharmonic's recent attempts, the New Horizons series (which was presented in the summers of 1983 and 1984) as self-defeating. The cause was definitely admirable: to have good orchestras play newor relatively recent compositions by contemporary composers. In Babbitt's view, though, it is impossible to present such a diversity of works with limited, if any rehearsal time This is a problem compounded by a general apathy on the parts of the public and the performs s. Babbitt asserts that these series ultimately achieved ""cursory, uninspired readings of works that demand intensive, careful rehearsals and genuine interest by both conductors and musicians alike."" Economic reasons for the regression of serious music are pretty obvious. There is just not enough subsidization and interest from major organizations and foundations. ""No one seems to realize,"" Babbitt complains, ""how much it costs to prepare and produce a musical event. The cost lies somewhere between 14,000 and 15,000 dollars."" There is little public demand for this sort of music beyond the devotees of new music, which brings up Babbitt's most crucial point concerning the unlikely survival of serious music. Babbitt feels that most people are musically ignorant and unprepared to understand or even appreciate serious music. Recreating a passage from one of his articles, ""Some Aspects of Twelve-Tone Composition,"" he explains, that ""an understanding of serious music can scarcely exist when this body of music goes largely unpublished, unrecorded, and unperformed by the large, prominent orchestras and the well-known chamber ensembles."" He continues by stating that ""difficult, advanced music presents a label that supplies a basis for automatic rejection"" by the public. ""The American 'music lover's' conservatism, a conservatism of ignorance rather than of considered choice, is nurtured and fostered by performers, concert managers, and Boards of Directors for their own comfort, convenience, and profit."" Babbitt believes that the average person is simply not musically educated enough to cope with the mental demands of serious music. (I guess Music Humanities does have a purpose, after all.) ""Musical structure is in the ear of the beholder,"" Babbitt says; and unless that ear is musically educated, serious music has little hope for survival. Another cultural force perpetuating musical ignorance is journalism. Although he will spend very little time discussing this subject, it is important to point out journalism's contribution to the death of serious music. Babbitt says: ""The fate of a new, serious work is usually in the hands of music critics who are as little qualified to write about these works as any layman."" In addition, when music critics review a new work, they tend to inundate the reader with wholly irrelevant adjectives that describe nothing by aural impressions. Depending on the reviewer's choice of words, he can ""make or break"" the future of the work and is not subject to any burden of proof. They can claim that it is their prerogative (and job), based on subjective impressions, to write their opinions. Music critics, by and large, practically encourage the demise of serious music by influencing their readers with their own—sometimes biased—musical tastes.Babbitt will also discuss the social problems of serious music associated with the role of the composer in society. ""The social position of the composer in American society has change: now, most, if not all, American composers are university or conservatory trained."" He continues: ""American composers have also shifted their priorities; they, for the most part, teach as well as compose."" This dilemma certainly imposes limitations on the composer, who might bemoan his situation. Are composers justified in complaining about this problem? ""Poets apparently don't think so,"" Babbitt says, ""for they say they can teach and still generate a good deal of poetry.PHOTO COURTESY PROGRAM IN THE ARTS Milton Babbitt, above, will speak on Tuesday as part of Barnard's Program in the Arts."
252,Music Humanities,Spectator Feature A saga of dorm-ancy,13 November 1984,"A saga of dorm-ancyBy STEVE DRACHMANThe other day a friend said to me, ""You'd think this is a large college. Why is Columbia so screwed up?"" I couldn't answer that, but the statement reminded me of the mess of red tape I had to cut through in order to return here after I took off last semester to travel around Europe. Flashback time: When I decided to leave for a semester, I spoke first to one dean, who told me that there was no problem with my leaving and returning later, but that I could never return to the dormitories. Ever. That was one unbendable rule. Another dean told me the same thing, and wished me on my way. I was off, and the housing worries were the last thing on my mind. I discovered, to my shock, that though the college assured me that I was now withdrawn, they neverteless sent my spring semester schedule to my Maryland address. Whoever was in charge (a machine, I assume) decided that I had simply left Columbia housing and was now a commuter. I would have to commute a rather long distance, but what can you expect from a machine? Well, that was straightened out with little difficulty. Next, though, my parents got in touch with Dean of Housing Jane McDonald, who announced that because I would be returning as a second semester freshman, I would be entitled to dormitory housing, and that I should just ignore the other two deans—what did they know? I asked McDonald: ""Are you absolutely, completely certain? I won't wind up with no place to live next semester?"" She replied with a very convincing ""I am absolutely certain,"" then added, ""To the best of my knowledge."" This introduced doubts, but I ignored them and sent in my housing form. McDonald had said that I would hear about my assignmentby the end of the summer. I sent in my request for readmittance to this esteemed institution of higher learning, and waited for the expected letter of acceptance. Time went by. Finally, on the last day of August, they accepted me. All right, they only gave me 24 hours notice, but this is efficient by Columbia's standards. The housing department (which McDonald had since left) insisted that I was not a student, and they therefore could not provide housing. I was a student, I insisted, and I had the letter of acceptance. ""The Dean's Office forgot to send your readmittance form to us,"" they said. ""We can't do anything until they do."" They said if DeanThurmond spoke to them personally, they would get me housing. ""We sent the form to them!"" insisted the woman who answered the Dean's phone. ""I sent it myself."" I asked if Dean Thurmond could speak to me. She said that he was too busy to talk to anyone until sometime during the following week, but she would have him return my call. (He hasn't called back yet, but I'm hoping any day now . . . ) The Housing Office meanwhile found my form, which they had ""lost,"" and told me that they still couldn't find me housing for a while. Sorry. Make other plans. I found a relative to stay with, and tried toregister for classes. Unfortunately, the Dean's Office had taken action to hold my registration papers until I could prove to them that I was a student. The way to prove it? I needed a signature from the Dean's Office. When I asked the reason for this rather odd request, a new dean explained, ""It was a mistake."" I tried to sign up for required courses, but the computer rejected my form as ""Invalid."" I went to the registrar to make myself valid, but they had lost my form, and didn't really know what the problem was. I asked a woman in the registrar's office whether I would be invalid next semester also, and she responded with a definite ""No."" Somehow, I tend to have my doubts. So I had to put myself on waiting lists for my required courses. Not Music Humanities, however. There was no waiting list for that. I asked why not. ""The Dean's Office determined it,"" a woman at registration replied. ""Why did the Dean's Office determine it?"" asked I. ""They felt it was the right thing to determine,"" said she. ""Upon Earth there is not His like, a creature without fear. He is the king over all the sons of pride."" I always thought the Book of Job taught not to doubt God; now I think it may have been referring to the Dean's Office. Once again to my favorite office, which offered the following explanation for why there was no waiting list: ""We didn't know there would be a need for it."" But there was one department that knew I was a student, and was efficient beyond all other. It was the Bursar, which got my bill for this semester to me way ahead of time. I would like to congratulate them. So there it is. Why is Columbia so screwed up? I have no explanations, but 7Epectator7Rwould welcomd . . . etc.Yeah, everyone's just dying to get Into Columbia housing ."
253,Music Humanities,Women's studies for the College is investigated by several groups,7 November 1985,"By JENNIFER LYNCHSeveral Columbia College committee are addressing the question of developing a women's studies program in response to a report issued last May by the Ad Hoc Committee on Women's Studies, but deans for the undergraduate schools say they think student interest in such a program may not be very widespread. The report by the committee, chaired by Gillian Lindt, dean of the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences (GSAS), recommended establishing a minor in women's studies in the school of General Studies as well as providing more research support to students in GSAS. It also recommended that Columbia College deans appoint a committee to investigate gender studies in the remoteness requirement. The proposal for a new Institute for Research-on Women and Gender Studies announced last week also came from this committee. The Institute, which will open next July if it is approved by the Board of Trustees and the University Senate, will coordinate women's studies throughout the University. Columbia College will not be offering a major or a concentration in gender studies at this point because it does not have the resources, according to Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of Columbia College, and a member of the Lindt committee.Rosenthal also said he was not sure how widespread student interest in a specific women's studies program would be. He added that the Lindt committee requested the publication of a manual on teaching gender studies in the core curriculum. ""There has not been that much interest among the students in the past"" for a minor in women's studies, said Ward Dennis, dean of the School of General Studies, adding that most of the GS students are changing careers and have specific career goals. Dennis said his school's Committee on Instruction will study extensively the report's recommendation for a minor in women's studies before adopting such a plan. Stephanie Smallwood, CC '87, the coordinator of the Columbia College Women's Center and a member of the Lindt committee, said that the committee has not reached a consensus on whether to establish a major or concentration on women's studies in Columbia College. She said that some members of the committee think the college's faculty is too small to provide for it. She added that students need to be encouraged to think about women's studies. ""It's very revolutionary and it's not the kind of thing a college student is going to consider on his or herown,"" she said. ""The problem with women's studies is that it's very young as a field and it's not a specific discipline,"" Smallwood continued. ""It means going back and revamping a lot of the disciplines we study."" Another result of the Lindt committee is the formation of the Women in Contemporary Civilization Committee. Felice Lifshitz, a spokesperson for this committee, said that five Contemporary Civilizations professors who are also members of this group have added gender studies to their syllibi. Lifshitz said she has not changed the way she conducts her C.C. section as a result of the committee, nor has she added any new authors to her syllabus. ""You don't need to add more texts to talk about categories of gender. It's there,"" she said. She explained that she has always tried to incorporate an awareness of women into her C.C. class . She has used methods including asking more exam questions and assigning more paper topics on women. She added, however, that other faculty members were becoming interested in the committee's suggestions to include women's studies into the core and expressed interest in the committee's bibliography on women's studies. Car! Hovde, director of Literature Humanities and professor of English, said he has thought about adding women's studies into the course but has not worked out the details. He said he has not apointed a committee to look into the question, but rather is looking it himself. ' 'I certainly think it is a good idea and should be done,"" Hovde said. Adding to the myriad of committees that have been recently established to look into women's studies at the University,there are two student groups studying the possibilities for including women's studies in Columbia College's curriculum. Emira Woods, CC '88, and a member of the Student Council's Academic Affairs Committee, said that a subcommittee has been addressing the issue since last month. According to Woods, they are writing letters to departmental chairs advocating the addition of women's and black studies curricula, which would eventually lead to starting departments in both subjects. Woods said she would eventually like to see majors and concentrations in both areas. Woods said the committee was also interested in adding both women's and black studies to the core curriculum, citing the study of jazz in Music Humanities as an example. Lifshitz said that in her C.C. class she has already been teaching the role of blacks, although this discussion does not take place until late in the course. ""I do think that most people see all of these issues as tremendously interrelated,"" she said. ""One group's oppression is very related to another group's oppression."" Robert Radtke, chair of the Student Committee on Coeducation, which is under the Student Council, said that his committee is also looking into establishing more women's studies courses at Columbia College.* ""I don't think students think about it enough,"" Radtke said. He added that the committee's goal is to ""come up with a number of courses that seem plausible."" Radtke said that he, too, would like to see a major in women's studies, but said that this would be impossible right now because there are not enough courses in the area offered at Columbia College."
254,Music Humanities,Comment PMS: Not just for women anymore,24 October 1988,"PMS: Not just for women anymoreThe Lions won. The University and United Auto Workers Union District 65 settled their contract dispute without a strike. The sun has shone nearly every day and I haven't seen a bug all week. But just when the semester was looking great, the symptoms appeared: Crankiness, tension, nervousness, and hysteria all signalled the onset of the heinous Pre-Midterm Syndrome (PMS). This malady has an incubation period of 24 hours—the day immediately preceding an exam. Mom's chicken soup and an extra undershirt stand no chance against this debilitating disease.PMS first strikes when you discover that those expensive and unread books you purchased in September are useless because Metaphysics doesn't fulfill the science requirement. Its worst victims are juniors, laboring under the strain of fulfilling their major requirements. This past week, I have woken up in a cold sweat no less than three times thinking about the dire consequences of confusing British and German industrialization, or writing my Italian Literature term paper in Spanish. Consider a pre-med's apprehension at the thought of diagramming the hydra's reproductive organs on a chemistry exam, or the Classics major's consternation at confusing Socrates and Sophocles. Aside from personal effects, PMS leads to alienation and competition. Friendship means little when your chum is breaking the bell curve and you are the ringer. Sympathy can only stretch so far: When your pal, who has spent the last 48 hours in the library rereading reserve books, complains about how much work he has to do, there's a good chance he may end up with strychnine in his Smartfood. Scientific data concludes that PMS increases in inverse proportion to the time period between exams. Some lucky students have their midterms evenly spaced during the next few weeks; clearly, all of my professors got together this semester and determined which week to test me. And test me they do. My exam schedule makes Job's endeavors look like child's play. Strangely enough, many of these same professors bemoan the need for grades, advocating the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake. If they truly practiced what they preached.these faculty should protest the grading system. I would be more than willing to help them think up catchy chants. Clearly, students and faculty have a common interest in abolishing midterms. Since midterms serve no practical purpose, it is obvious that exams are profit-making ventures developed by the University in cahoots with the coffee, Jolt Cola, and tobacco industries. I would not be surprised to learn that Michael Sovern is a major stockholder in Vivarin, Inc. Note the suspicious blue-and-white design of the box. A committee must be appointed to investigate Columbia's connection with the drug underworld. Columbia is clearly reaping the money-making opportunities created by the three-midterm load of the average college student. Midterms may seem an unpleasant necessity, but you can escape the depression they induce. Don't study to excess. If you haven't bothered to pick up a book since mid-September, there is little chance that you will become an expert on Italian Renaissance paintings in twelve hours. Instead of studying,choose another option. For instance, you could read this month's issue of Cosmopolitan. When you go to take the mid-term, copy Cosmo's sex quiz into the blue book. Think of how much your professor will enjoy a little diversion and enlightenment after he has spent hours correcting other exams. In fact, there are countless ways to avoid this debilitating malady. You can go to the movies, choosing a film related to one of your courses. For a religion exam, you might write about ""The Last Temptation of Christ""; for a sociology mid-term you could analyze ""The Accused."" Your professor would be pleased to see you apply abstract concepts to concrete reality. You could even try writing your MusicHumanities paper on Run-DMC's ""Tougher than Leather."" More draconian measures might be necessary. Arrange for the entire class to skip the exam—after all, what professor in his right mind would fail an entire class? Invoke a hoary Columbia tradition and go on strike. Occupy Hamilton Hall and hold a Columbia College dean captive in his office—for once, you won't have to wait during open hours. Write your exam in a foreign language. Tell the professor you have malaria. Or pretend you don't understand English. There are truly billions of other ways to avoid the mid-term scourgebut you'll have to think of them yourselves. I've got to study.Penny Britell is a Barnard College junior.Up to no good Penny Britell"
255,Music Humanities,"Faculty, admins praise core curriculum report",27 January 1989,"By Evan Paul SchultzThe report released in December by the committee that reviewed Columbia College's core curriculum reaffirms the school's dedication to general education in both Western and non-Western areas, faculty and administrators said. The Commission on Core Curriculum, which was chaired by William Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, was created in February, 1988 by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack. The committee's report did not suggest major changes for Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), Music Humanities, or Art Humanities. But the committee did recommend reform in areas of non-Western and modern traditions, through the creation of an ""extended core"" which would examine ""major problems of contemporary civilization that are of global scope and significance."" These issues should be studied in the same manner as in current Lit Hum and CC courses, the report said. According to the report, the extended core should avoid focusing onparticular cultures or religions, and instead emphasize common themes and problems, to ""minimize any element of ethnic self-assertion, ideological special interest, or minority advocacy partaking of a politicized struggle that could turn the curriculum into a jungle of educational conflict and competition."" ""A core course should approx-imate a multi-cultural forum, rather than serve as a platform or pulpit for the promotion of a particular ideology or religion,"" the report reads. In addition, the committee proposed the establishment of a Standing Committee on Core Curriculum to report regulary to the Columbia College faculty on the state of the core. Assistant Professor of East Asian Studies Paul Anderer, a member of the committee, called the creation of the standing committee the ""heart and soul"" of the report. The core commission strongly advocated revamped staffing procedures in the core courses, including the reinstitution of the Chamberlain leave program for CC preceptors—a paid one-year leave of absence awarded upon the completion of three years of teaching—and granting special consideration to preceptors and assistant professors who apply for promotion or tenure in their departments. Pollack, who said he was ""indebted"" to the commission fora ""realistic,"" report, said that Columbia College could not independently implement all of the committee's recommendations. ""Recommendations made which cover issues of resources and academic priorities and department staffing patterns cannot be solvedin Columbia College. They must be confirmed by [the] arts and sciences [division of the University] as a whole,"" he said. Pollack said he will ask the Columbia College faculty by next month to change the bylaws of the faculty Standing Committee. I will do what I can to be sure whatever needs [the commission calls for] will be fulfilled respective to the college so we will be able to meet the challenges so clearly posed in the commission report,"" Pollack said. Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal, a member of the committee, said the commitee's report voices the general agreement of its members, but that he ""[doesn't] agree with everything. No one does with a consensus report."" The Standing Committee would deal with the actual restructuring of the core, Rosenthal added. Chair of the Contemporary Civilization department and Professor of History Ainslee Embree, who served on the core review committee, said the report could have placed more emphasis on non-Western cultures. ""I would have preferred to see [the report] more clearly focused on non-Western traditions. In the present suggested form it may be too distributional and similar to the old remoteness requirement,"" Embree said.Columbia College's remoteness requirement, under which students take six points in areas outside their major or courses related to their major, was replaced by the requirement that students take six points in courses dealing with major cultures ""not covered adequately by the core."" Embree said he felt the committee made valid pedalogical arguments for maintaining the Western emphasis. The report suggests that by limiting material to Western traditions in courses like Lit Hum and CC, students will undergo ""an examination of their own mental furniture,"" before moving on to the non-Western works to be covered in the extended core. Anderer, an assistant professor of East Asian Studies, said he would have preferred more non-Western texts integrated into Lit Hum and CC, but maintained that the report's value lay in reaffirming the faculty's interest in teaching general education core courses. ' 'What the committee tried to do was see if the faculty remained committed to teaching general education courses of any kind, either Western or non-Western,"" he said. The opportunity still exists to study nonWestern cultures in the ""second tier"" of the extended core, which would include a greater number of electives than the current core,Anderer said. Robert Belknap, Chair of the Lit Hum department and professor of Russian Language and Literature, said he thought the report left much for the standing committee to accomplish. ""The report specified certain things, while it decided to delegate others to the standing committee. The report is demanding some commitment from the entire University. The report itself won't do a thing,"" he said. Belknap said he approved of placing nonWestern cultures in the extended core. ""That's definitely where they belong. I'd hate to see amateurs like me trying to do justice to those things which are beyond our expertise. I can do a half-way decent job with Greek literature, but not for Indian,"" he said. Wallace Gray, professor of English and Comparitive Literature, who has taught Lit Hum since 1963 and has published a book on the texts read in the course, said he strongly agrees with committee's stress on Western traditions. ""I support the notion that in order to be an educated student you must read Western works which have influenced all cultures,"" he said. Gray said he favors the extended core over the addition of non-Western texts to the core curriculum, where reading one non-Western book would, he said, amount to tokenism.Robert Pollack"
256,Music Humanities,Comment Course inconsistency causes core curriculum catastrophe,1 February 1989,"Course inconsistency causes core curriculum catastropheAnother January, another stroll down the corridor of Philosophy Hall. We all know the feeling of frantically searching for the computer printouts of our classes. Cautiously we run our finger down the sheet until our social security number appears. There it is: your grade. I personally am fascinated by grades. In fact, I don't just look at my own grades, I look at every grade in every class. I start at Accounting and keep perusing until I finish with Yiddish.While it may seem bizarre and disturbed, this ritual is ultimately insightful. Having examined grades for three years, I have learned there is great variance in grading between different sections of Columbia College core curriculum classes. Grade distributions generally vary from department to department, and from class to class. Some departments or classes have mostly high grades, while others do not. Either all the smart people take the same classes, or some classes are easier than others. I incline toward the latter. For most subjects this does not jose a problem, as people who choose a particular course know what they're getting into. For some, difficulty of a class does not matter as long as the subject is interesting. For others— especially masochists and lazy students— difficulty of a class is of great importance in deciding whether or not to take it. Where students have freedom to pick aspecific class, it is of no real importance that some are easier than others. Unfortunately, the area in which this choice does not exist happens to be one that is integral to the Columbia undergraduate educational experience: the core curriculum. We are led to believe that the core curriculum is meant to unify Columbia College students by providing them with a commoneducational base. Ideally, once we all drink from this common spring, we then can then diversify—complementing a broad base with the major electives of choice. However, the base is uniform neither in content nor in workload. The only truly unifying aspect of the core curriculum is that most students bond together in opposition to it. The classes in the core—LiteratureHumanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art and Music Humanities, and English—do not appear to be standardized. Anyone who has taken these ""automated sectioning"" classes know that emphasis and workload vary significantly. There is a clear disparity between core intent and core content. Each instructor intends to teach the same subject, but this results in 25 distinct classes with different syllabi, requirements, and grading standards. Consider my Contemporary Civilization class. While students in other sections basked in the simplicity of their respective requirements, my class sat dazed as the instructor outlined the course, assigning paper after paper. At the end of the semester, the final tally came to ten papers—in addition to the midterm and final exams. He gave one A grade. It wasn't mine. It is not unreasonable to require this much work fora four-point course, but it is clearly unfair that instructors of other sections assign one-quarter as much work. To ice the cake of injustice, these easygoing educators even award higher grades. Of all the core courses, Literature Humanities is the only one which implements a standard finaTexam. While it is expected that instructors will always vary in grade leniency, regulating course requirements would at least help to equalize these allegedly ""core"" courses. As long as discrepancies exist between core sections, students should be allowed to make informed choices regarding which core classthey will enroll in. In Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization this is usually possible. Since the sectioning forms list the names of the instructors, students can find out who many of them are. Nevertheless, this is generally only true for the professors, while the graduate student teachers often remain a mystery. The real crime is the randomness of Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and English. Anyone who takes these classes learns that one's grade is largely determined by the computer in Philosophy Hall that places the student in a specific section. These classes are supposed to be the same from section to section, but they are not. The worst offenders are the English 1007 composition instructors. Though the workload is fairly consistent, the demands are completely inconsistent. Some of the instructors give out mostly Cs, while some give out mostly Bs or As. Unlike Art and Music Humanities, one generally cannot drop these classes even ifplaced in a lousy section. Sectioning for these requirements is more like playing Lotto than selecting a class. If section diversity is to be maintained, it is imperative that the University provide the same information about different core classes as they do about other courses. All this would require is a little more paperwork and computertime for the University. With so much fairness to be gained, this extra burden seems a small price to pay. The core curriculum exists because the school believes certain subjects are important enough to be required. Labeling these courses as ""core"" infers that everyone will learn essentially the same information. It should also mean that the same demands are expected of all students. If these courses are so important, they should be truly standardized so that everyone has an equal opportunity to learn and benefit from them. As of now, the core curriculum fails to meet this crucial standard.Jeff Rake is a Columbia College junior.Rake's progress Jeff Rake"
257,Music Humanities,Sounds of defiance,3 February 1989,"To the Editor: We, the managers of the Columbia University bands, are outraged by the substantial cut in funding for music lessons at Teachers College for Columbia students. While Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack may consider music to be only an ""amenity,"" we feel that it is a vital part of the liberal arts atmosphere here. Fora fine educational institution like Columbia to have such an unsupportive attitude towards the fine arts is disheartening. There is obviously a large interest in the performing arts, particularly in music. In just the past few years, the Concert Band has been reformed and a Dixieland Band has been created while both the Marching Band and the Jazz Band continue to maintain a strong core of members. There is also continued interest in the Columbia University Orchestra. As part of the liberal arts core at Columbia, all Columbia College students are required to take Music Humanities. If it is so important to study the history of music, why is the serious pursuit of a musical instrument merely a luxury? While Music Humanities may teach students to recognize music, learning a musical instrument also teaches the individual patience, dedication, and responsibility. We feel, therefore, that the practice and performance as well as the study of music should have a higher priority on this campus. We are also concerned with the manner in which the lack of support for music reflects on Columbia College as a whole. Columbia prides itself on providing a top-quality liberal arts education, yet it is painfully deficient in the area of fine arts. Columbia prides itself on being a place where students of diverse backgrounds and interests can come together, yet its financial priorities demonstrate to those interested in the fine arts that they are not welcome here. Columbia is in the heart of the most artistically exciting city in the world, yet it is an island in the city due to a dearth of support for the arts. These striking contrasts can only convey a negative image to a high school musician who would otherwise be interested in Columbia. The bands at Columbia have a tough time. This recent cut in funding for music lessons can only make it more difficult for our organizations to survive and to serve the Columbia community. Many members of the bands took lessons with instructors at Teachers College but found themselves shut out at the last minute when they went to register for lessons for this semester. The purpose of an educational institution should be to help the interests of students to mature, not to halt their progress. We would also like to point out the dedication of our organizations to Columbia, a dedication that we do not feel is reciprocated by the administration. At the Civic Celebration two years ago marking the bicentennial of the Columbia College charter, the bands led the parade down to Federal Hall. In fact a picture has appeared in the Columbia College Bulletin for the past two years commemorating this event. The Jazz Band frequently performs at functions in Low Library and at other major University events. The Concert Band and Dixieland Band perform a lew times every semester for the entertainment of the Columbia community. While few students attended football games over the past five years, the Marching Band was at almost every single game to support both the football and basketball teams. Our love of Columbia cannot be questioned. With all of this in mind, we ask the administration to reconsider the importance of the fine arts at Columbia and to increase funding for music lessons for Columbia students at Teachers College.

258,Music Humanities,CC faculty approves core committee,28 February 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzA new standing committee charged with reshaping and monitoring Columbia College's core curriculum was unanimously approved by the Columbia College faculty last week. The new standing committee will use the de Bary commission report on the core submitted in December as a blueprint for its work, according to standing committee chair Jacob Smit, professor of history. A committee to review the core curriculum, chaired by Theodore de Bary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, was established by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack last year. The commission's final report call-ed for an ""extended core"" to cover non-Western cultures and committment by the Columbia College and the University to the core. It also called for the establishment of the standing committee to review the core curriculum continuously. Smit said the report left considerable room for discussion. The committee's first responsibility will be to set up the structure of the ""extended core"" because of problems facing the current major cultures requirement. ""There are practical reasons to devote most of our energies to the extended core because the major cultures requirement has led to over-subscription of many courses,"" Smit said. The two-semester major cultures requirement was instituted last semester to ensure that students take courses dealing with non-Western cultures. Many teachers of thecourses reported problems of overcrowding last month. The major cultures requirement has the added problem of not including general education courses, he said. ""For the time being it uses all types of courses in non-Western cultures, but the ideal would be to design courses to be logical developments of Contemporary Civilizations [CC] and Literature Humanities [Lit Hum] that would fit into the core ideal,"" Smit said. The faculty accepted all but one of the de Bary Commission's suggestions, rejecting only the call for the standing committe to ""assist the deans and department in the recruitment of new faculty and promotion of those now in service to insure that the instructional needs of the core curriculum are given due weight in the selection process."" ""What the recommendation would do is involve the commission in recruiting people for departments. The departmens want to be sovereign and don't want instructions from an alien source,"" Smit said. The faculty would not have accepted the de Bary report without the deletion, according to Professor of English and comparative literature Joan Ferrante. The elimination of the recruiting stipulation will not hamstring the standing committee, according to Paul Anderer, associate professor of East Asian Languages and cultures. However, Smit may find it necessary to reinstate the recommendation, or something similar to it, according to Anderer. The controversial stipulation is unnecessary because departments already recruit people who are interested in teaching core classes, Pollack said. Smit said he would push fora reinstatement of the Chamberlain fellowships, paid year-long leaves of absence granted to CC preceptors after two years of teaching, which wereeliminated three years ago. ""Preceptors sacrifice a lot. The first year [of teaching] they are not capable of working on their dissertations so they deserve something like Chamberlain leave for time sacrificed on their career goals,"" he said. The standing committee will hold its first meeting within two weeks, Smit said. Smit added that he envisions a core curriculum which deals with issues that cast light on current events. ""The reading list in the core curriculum should be consistent with contemporary problems on an abstract level. It shouldn't be a canon,"" he said. The charter for the committee will expire at the end of the term, pending the faculty's reaction to a report on science education at Columbia College, Pollack said. The committee to review the science requirement has completed its final report and given it to Pollack, but he has not yet responded to it, he said. The faculty may instruct the standing committee to review the recommendations of the science report, Pollack said. Standing committee members include four tenured professors, two assistant professors, the directors of CC, Lit Hum, Art Humanities and Music Humanities, the director of the Heyman Center for the Humanities, and two students, to be nominated by the Academic Affairs subcommittee of the Columbia College Student Council and approved by Pollack, according to Smit. More members will be added to deal with specific problems as they arise, he said. The student members have not been chosen because Pollack has yet to notify the academic affairs committee of the creation of the standing committee, according to academic affairs Committee Chair Jane Murphy, CC '89.Jacob Smit"
259,Music Humanities,Guidelines set to evaluate classes for extended core,17 May 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzIn the first major step in converting the current Major Cultures requirement into an ""extended core curriculum,"" guidelines for extended core classes were approved earlier this month by the Columbia College Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum. The guidelines will be used to judge existing courses currently included in the Major Cultures requirement and to develop new courses, according to Committee Chair Jacob Smit, Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History. However, the current budget crunch facing the University will preclude any sweeping changes from occurring for at least two years, Smit said. Funding is needed to develop new courses and to hire new teachers,since many of the extended core classes will involve small departments, such as East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALAC), he said. The committee will also canvass funds from educational foundations to develop the new courses, Smit said. Until then, he said courses currently fulfilling the Major Cultures requirement will be evaluated according to the new guidelines, but new ones will not be created. The list for next semester's requirement should be completed in a few weeks, Smit said. A two-term extended core was proposed last semester by a commission created by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack to review the core, which was chaired by JohnMitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary. The Standing Committee on the core was created by the faculty earlier this term to continually review the core, following another recommendation by the deßary commission. The Major Cultures requirement, which replaced the Remoteness Requirement last September, calls for all Columbia College students to take two approved courses in areas which address cultures outside the Western world. Many students have complained that the classes are too large and that the subjects covered are too specific. The new guidelines state that the extended core is ""meant to build on the work of the existing"" core classes, which include Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities, Art Humanities and Music Humanities, by ""enlarging the scope and inquiry beyond the primary Western focus . . . and extending their subject matter to include questions and problems of the contemporary world."" The guidelines state that all extended core courses must address either a non-Western culture or civilization, or a contemporaryissue, such as racism or environmental problems. Students will be required to take at least one civilization course, and can fulfill the second term of the extended core requirement with either an issues course or a civilization course, Smit said. The committee decided to emphasize the civilization aspect of the extended core to address what it saw as the core's biggest deficiency, Smit explained. The civilization courses will address material independent from Western tradition, although all cultures will be seen as interacting with each other, he said. ""We will be dealing with these things as Westerners trying to understand and respect the cultures on their own terms,"" Smit said. All of the courses ""should engage the students in the disputatious learning that the existing core tries to cultivate,"" according to the guidelines. Smit added that the committee recommends a 40-student cap on all extended core classes. The guidelines diminish the number of graduate courses which would be included in the list, Smit said.Classes with a majority of graduate students tend to get overly technical, thus undermining the general education emphasis and discussion which the extended core should embody, he said. ""Graduate level courses would not necessarily be excluded, but in general we do not want to approve courses in which there are a large number of graduate students, though a sprinkling is okay,"" Smit said. Committee members also discussed whether to include courses which teach defunct civilizations, according to committee member Professor of Art History and Archeology Richard Brilliant. Just as CC texts written 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece are relevant to modern society, other ancient civilizations may yield pertinent works and ideas, Brilliant explained. Smit said extinct cultures warrent examination, especially in the case of the Aztecs, since a large amount of modern Mexican culture is based on currents stemming from the ancient period. Dorsey Dunn, CC '91, one of two studenj representatives on the Standing Committee, said the contemporary issues courses wouldsatisfy student concerns that certain issues, such as gender and racial issues, be addressed. Smit said he was interested in student concerns and would talk to student representatives about concerns of the student body. In a related decision, the Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI) approved the deletion of a rule which called for students to take their Major Cultures classes in subject areas other than their major. Smit, who serves on the COI, said professors in EALAC complained that their students were put at a disadvantage because many of the Major Cultures courses are EALAC courses. Smit called the original distinction ""bureaucratic,"" and said the Standing Committee had concluded that ""there was no connection whatsoever between the two requirements,"" before relaying that decision to the COI. The decision will be applied retroactively, but only to those courses which are still on the list in the fall, Smit said.HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE: Student Senators Veena Sud, BC '89, and Warigia Bowman, CC '90, present University President Michael Sovern with Michael the pet rat."
260,Music Humanities,CC core curriculum expands beyond west,30 August 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzIn response to criticism that the Columbia College Core Curriculum is eurocentric, sexist, and outdated, a new requirement encompassing courses on non-Western cultures, women, minoriries, and contemporary issues will go into effect this year. The new requirement and other aspects of the core will be constantly reviewed and modified by a new standing committee composed of Columbia College faculty members and students. The two semester ""extended core,' as it is called, requires all incoming students, as well as this year's sophmores and juniors, to take at least one course in a non-Western culture and the other course on either a second culture or a contemporary issue such as women's rights. The courses which satisfy the requirement are printed on a list available in the Registrar's office and the Dean of Student's office. The extended core replaces last years Major Cultures requirement, which required two semesters of study in an area other than Western culture. Complaints about the requirement were based on the lack of focus of the courses which fulfilled the requirement, and severe overcrowding in the classes. If students have already completed the Major Cultures requirement, they will not be responsible for the extended core. The standing committee defined the courses for the extended core by refining the Major Cultures requirement list. The committee also suggested a limit of40 students per class for extended core classes, though demand may overwhelm any such restriction. Additionally, according to the chair of the committee, Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History Jacob Smit, courses used for the extended core will also count for towards majors and concentrations, which was not the case for the major cultures requirement. The idea for an extended core came from a committee of professors commissioned by former Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack to evaluate and make recommendations for the core. The commission, chaired by John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary, reaffirmed the bulk of the core. The core still consists of the two semester sequences of Literature Humanities (Lit-Hum) and Contemporary Civilizations (CC), and one semester each of Music Humanities and Art Humanities. However, the commision did propose the extended core, as well as the formation of the standing committee. Though it has started to define the new requirement, the standing committee has yet to form the core of the extended core by developing new courses which use the seminar method of Lit Hum and CC. That will take time, money, and more money. Besides requiring funding for research, which Smit said he hopes to obtain from educational foundations, many new professors will need to be hired—both to deal with the new de-mand for courses which are taught from what have been small departments at Columbia and to accomodate the 40 student limit for the classes Since faculty members are hired through the departments, not by Columbia College, any approvals for mass hirings for the extended core will have to be approved by the central ad-ministration of the University. Not an easy task. Smit has said that it will be a few years before the new courses are developed and put into place. But the extended core, if all goes well, promises to address compelling modern thoughts and trends while allowing the continuation of the traditional core courses."
261,Music Humanities,Focus The arts at Columbia: Are we headed for new heights?,2 October 1989,"The arts at Columbia: Are we headed for new heights?By Robert Kolker and Jordan DavisThe students are ready. Last spring, Columbia College students voted ""yes"" on a referendum calling for the creation of an umbrella organization for campus arts. The resources are coming. Last fall, the state-of-the-art Kathryn Bache Miller Theatre opened on campus, and another high-quality campus theater will open later this month. And the curriculum is starting to catch up. Columbia College just established a joint program 'with the Juilliard School of Music. And within a week University administrators will meet to formulate programs that, for: the first time, will allow undergraduates across the University to major or concentrate in the creative and performing arts. Obstacles to the arts remain large: there are concerns over funding for new programs. There's also the red tape of administrative committees and the self-imposed restrictions of each college. Still, in the next few years, undergraduate involvement in music, theater, painting, dance, creative writing and other creative arts could reach unprecedented heights. A radical restructuring The bright future of undergraduate arts at Columbia is largely the result of changes that have occurred within the University's School of the Arts. The school used to cater almost exclusively to graduate students, but soon its doors will become wide open to undergraduates. The second-smallest and the newest of the University's graduate schools, the School of the Arts struggled since its beginnings in 1965. The school was kept financially and structurally isolated from the rest of Columbia and faced fierce competition from the many other arts schools in New York City. By last June, the school was $1.6 million in debt. ""The School of the Arts was, in a sense, ghettoized,"" says Martin Meisel, the University's vice president for arts and sciences. Peter Smith, dean of the School of the Arts, says that ""the kind of adjustments that the University made with other schools were not made with the School of the Arts."" Last October, the University established the Working Group on the Future of the Arts to figure out how to help the beleaguered school. The group—which included Meisel and was chaired by then-Deputy University Provost Michael Mooney—also tried to find ways to strengthen the arts curricula of the University's undergraduate schools. The findings of the Working Group—announced last March— were, to say the least, unprecedented. The group recommended a radical restructuring of the School of the Arts that will gear the school to undergraduates. As of June 1, the school became part of the University's division of arts and sciences—which also includes Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the School of International Affairs and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. As a result of the switch, the division of arts and sciences swallowed the School of the Arts' debt. This structural change means more than financial health for the School of the Arts. By affiliating the graduate school with other schools in the University, the development of new, University-wide, undergraduate arts curricula becomes much more feasible. Mooney's Working Group recommended that the restructuring of the school trigger a brand new direction for the school and for undergraduate arts at Columbia. The group sug-gested creating an undergraduate major in the visual arts, as well as expanding Barnard's dance and theater majors to include Columbia College and General Studies. The arts are being injected into the undergraduate curriculum from another angle as well. In August, the University formed a committee chaired by Professor of Art History David Rosand to design undergraduate courses, majors and programs in the arts. It still will be a while before undergraduates can major or have concentrations in the creative and performing arts: Rosand's committee hasn't even had a formal meeting yet. And the Rosand committee's designs must then be approved by each University undergraduate school before undergraduates can enroll in the programs. But although Rosand himself says he thinks it's ""premature to talk about majors in the arts,"" he adds that he ""would feel we had failed if we didn't bring it off."" ""The creative arts do have a place in undergraduate education,"" says Smith. Even though the School of the Arts' new structure has forced it to eliminate two graduate fine arts programs, Smith says he supports the school's new focus on undergraduate instruction. Redirecting resources One of the biggest problems the Rosand Committee and future comittees on the arts will face is the dilemma of funding. Administrators like Meisel and Smith say they have a strategy for avoiding the high cost of creating new arts programs —a strategy in which all undergraduates will benefit from the strengths of the few arts programs that now exists.Meisel calls the strategy ""redirecting resources""—changing existing programs like Barnard's Theatre department and the School of the Arts' painting and sculpture program to accept students from across the University. Under this strategy, fewer new departments will have to be created and fewer new faculty hired. Smith says that the policy of redirecting resources ""was inherent in the report of the Mooney Committee."" The Mooney group recommmended that ""the principal commitment to teaching undergraduates in theater would come from the Barnard department,"" he adds. But while redirecting resources may save money on program development, some students and faculty see drawbacks. Seth Goldstein, CC '92, acting chair of the Columbia Theatre Network, predicts that ""until Columbia College has a theater faculty of its own, a theater major will not last more than three years.'' He says the Barnard department's emphasis on performance may be seen as too pre-professional for the Columbia College administration. English Professor Michael Rosenthal, former associate dean of Columbia College, says Columbia College's faculty has frowned on pre-professional arts program proposals in the past. Rosenthal decries the Mooney Working Group's strategy of redirecting resources, saying that ""cooperative arrangements can help lighten financial burdens, but you want to create something that's first-rate. It is essential that whatever program exists be under the control of the College faculty."" However, he adds, ""This does not preclude joint programs."" The Juilliard Connection One joint program that is a boon to undergraduate arts at Columbia is the new Columbia College-Juilliard School of Music program. The program, which debuted this semester, promises to attract the most able of young student-musicians and make the theory-based music department at Columbia more well-rounded. The program allows participating Columbia students to cross-register at Juilliard for lessons and gives them the option in their junior year to apply fora 3/2 bachelor of arts/master of music program. The first three years of the program are spent at Columbia, the last two at Juilliard. Thirteen Columbia College students —six of them first-year students —now participate in the program, according to Assistant Director of Columbia College Admissions Rica Cuenca. And interest in the program is growing. Cuenca says about three students a week write the admissions office requesting information about the program. Cuenca calls the program ""very selective,"" and Rosand worries that the program might be too exclusive and not admit enough students. But Columbia College Associate Dean Kathryn Yatrakis says the presence of the Juilliard program will also attract more students to the music department. She says the Juilliard program should boost the reputation of the music department enough to attract applicants who have a peripheral interest in music but have no intention of applying for the 3/2 program. In the Columbia-Juilliard progam's first few weeks, a few partipants have encountered bureaucratic problems. In August, Gwendolyn Moy, CC '93, attempted to cross-register for class at Juilliard, only to find that Columbia had failed to inform her of Juilliard's audition date. The mishap may prevent Moy from taking ear training, a two-semester Juilliard class, until next fall. ""There are some people who are helping me,"" says Moy of her registration difficulties. Yatrakis says that the problems experienced by Moy and others will be addressed by He pro-gram's technical committee. ""The questions that have come up,"" she says, ""will certainly be the questions that [the technical committee] will try to solve."" Student Mobilization Not only is Columbia's curriculum going artsy, campus arts groups are becoming more organized than ever before. With the success of last spring's referendum, Postcrypt Arts Underground (PAU) became the first in a number of umbrella student arts organizations. PAU is the fusion of the Postcrypt Gallery—which opened in January 1988—and the 25 year-old Postcrypt Coffeehouse. The gallery, says PAU Director Christine C. Palmieri, BC '90, offers ""exposure and support"" to at least two student artists in each of its monthly shows. She adds that the success of the gallery, along with that of its compatriots in the umbrella, have caused Postcrypt to grow ""from a staff of one to a staff of 38 in approximately two years."" Also, last semester saw the creation of the Columbia Theatre Network (CTN). CTN was organized by Goldstein, and it herded all the campus theater groups—including the Varsity Show, Columbia Courtiers, Columbia Players, Jewish Theater Ensemble, Barnard Student Theater—under one umbrella. Before the creation of CTN, undergraduate theater groups were scattered. Bob Guay, CC '82, board member of the Courtiers, recalls that when he first arrived at Columbia, he could not find any of the groups. ""The best you could do was leave a message in a mailbox,"" he says. Goldstein says he thinks CTN will bring a unity of purpose and resources to the Columbia theater scene. Many members of the campus literary community are considering following PAU's and CTN's lead and pooling their resources. ""It would be good to have a coordinating council of literary magazines,"" says Wayne Plasha, CC '91, editor of Utter, a student magazine. Max Winter, CC '92, managing editor of the Columbia Review, says, ""There really is a lot of rivalry among the magazines. It doesn't have to be that way.""The recent mobilization and unification of the undergraduate arts community has been partially inspired by the arrival of new arts facilities on campus. Two new theaters, the Kathryn Bache Miller Theatre and the Alma Schapiro Theater, are providing campus performers and arts enthusiasts with a sense of opportunity that was nearly non-existent two years ago. The Schapiro Center, scheduled to open in mid-October, will add a ""black box,"" 150-seat theater to Columbia's growing roster of arts facilities. The modern, high-tech theater has generated excitement among members of CTN, who see Schapiro as much more suitable for theater than Ferris Booth Hall (FBH) ever was. Goldstein and CTN have been advising campus administrators since last February on how the new theater should be used. Lyle Zimskind, CC'9O, director of the Varsity Show, has expressed reservations about Schapiro Theater. ""The new theater will probably seat fewer people than even the Lion's Den [in FBH], where we [the Varsity Show] performed before last year."" "" Last year, the Varsity Show became the first undergraduate theater group to perform in the Miller Theatre. The Miller seats more than three times as many people as Schapiro Theater and is just as modern a facility, having opened just last fall. But Mary Kay Fletcher, assistant director of the Miller, says the Miller is not best suited for dramatic theater. ""When they built it [the Miller], they cut back on the kinds of things that made it a real drama theater,"" she says. Fletcher adds that the theater is more suitable for open readings, lectures and musical performances than it is for drama. While Schapiro Theater will be primarily reserved for undergraduates as a free performance space, the Miller Theatre is shared by all divisions of the University and charges campus groups money for its use. Smith, who is the Miller's director as well as dean of the School of the Arts, calls the Miller ""a halfway house, where rent isn't asked for but expenses are."" So 1 far, this arrangement has proven impractical for undergraduate .groups, who have stayed in FBH's free space, s Still, after only a year, the Miller has built a reputation on New York's upper west side for booking top-name, professional performers, including violinist Gil Shaham, CC '93 [see sidebar], ""Miller is holding a whole week in January for undergraduate performance,"" says Fletcher. Certain events at the Miller, such as a series of literary readings and a performance in the spring of music covered in the Music Humanities course, are aimed specifically toward undergraduates. While the theater remains chiefly a non-undergraduate facility, the presence of the Miller has strengthened the University arts community and, according to Rosenthal, helped convince administrators the time is right to consider broadening the arts curriculum. More receptive administration - Also, the recent large turnover in the University's upper ranks has brought administrators to Columbia who are more willing than their predecessors to go to bat for the arts. ""Is an intellectual case to be made for creative writing [as a major]? I rather doubt it."" former Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack once said. But Pollack and others have been replaced by administrators who, as newcomer Yatrakis puts it, ""see things that maybe others don't because we're new."" Newly appointed Columbia College Dean Jack Greenberg, Pollack's replacement, has declined to comment on the issue of undergraduate arts, but Goldstein says Greenberg has reponded favorably to the proposals of CTN. Meisel, who has just begunhis job as vice president of arts and sciences, is an avowed supporter of the arts. Smith, who came to the School of the Arts two years ago from Dartmouth's Hopkins Center, an allundergraduate arts facility, says that ""it may be that one of the components in my being selected for the deanship was that I had spent the previous 17 years at Dartmouth, where not only are arts in the curriculum, but the status of all the arts groups is manifested in the whole institution."" heading While the new administrators and the new facilities may help create a warm climate for undergraduate arts, only one factor can assure that action will be taken: money. The School of the Arts' new undergraduate emphasis may never have come about if the division of Arts and Sciences wasn't able to pick up the School of the Arts' $1.6 million debt. In fact, 17 years ago, a committee with a mission to form a ""proposal for a University-wide arts program"" decided not to alter the structure of the School of the Arts because the University didn't have the money. ""[Jacques Barzun, chair of the 1972 committee] had a definite interest in undergraduate arts, but budgetary realities caught up with that,"" says Philosophy Professor Arthur Danto, who was a member of 1972 committee. Smith says the 1970's were ""times of real austerity. The opportunity for significant change just dissipated. ""I think this is the big chance for arts at Columbia,"" he adds. ""In spite of all constrictions we all feel in terms of money, there is a much stronger sense of the possible than there was around 1972 or 1973. Now I believe it's here; then it was just something on paper.""Kenny Fung's A Landing Spot,which appeared at Postcrypt Art Gallery's opening show of the semester last month."
262,Music Humanities,NEH's ideal core looks like CU's,13 October 1989,"By David KaufmanToo many students are graduating from the nation's colleges and universities without knowing ""basic landmarks of history and thought,"" according to a report issued by Lynn V. Cheney, chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities(NEH). The report, entitled ""50 Hours,"" suggests that institutions of higher learning begin emphasizing general education to fill gaps in college graduates' knowledge. The proposal suggests a model50-hour college core curriculum that would focus on the study of the development of civilization and culture. In many aspects, the proposed curriculum resembles Columbia College's Core Curriculum, re-quired of all Columbia College undergraduates. According to Ainslee Embree, acting dean of the school of Internation and Public Affairs (SIPA), and former chair of the Contem porary Civilizationss department, the first draft of ""50-hours"" many have contained many more references to Columbia that were cut. ""I suspect that there may have been too much Columbia University,"" he said. Issued Sunday, the report cites a Gallup poll showing widespread ignorance of facts that are considered part of a complete cultural vocabulary. The poll tested 691 college seniors with 87 questions about history and literature, including questions asking students to identify significant works or acts by people of color and women. Poll results showed that on a grade scale ranging from""A"" to ""F,"" with an ""F"" being a score of under 60 percent, 55 percent of the students would have received ""F""s while only 2 percent would have received ""A""s. Nine percent would have earned ""B""s, 14 percent ""C""s, and 20 percent ""D""s. Columbia and the Core Curriculum are mentioned several times in the report, which features an extensive ""Curriculum Profile,""detailing the longstanding core tradition at Columbia College. A reading list from the 40-year-old Oriental Humanties course is also given. Currently, Columbia College students spend approximately 52 hours in required classes out of a total of 124 hours needed to graduate. ""At the heart of this [proposed 50-hour] core curriculum is a sequence of courses, taking 3 years to complete, that provides students opportunities to explore the formative periods of civilization on several continents; to follow the development of Western society and thought; to trace the way Americans have extended the Western tradition and developed a distinctive culture in this country; and to understand as well the evolution of other traditions,"" the report said. In addition, the proposed curriculum would require courses in Foreign Language, Mathematics, the Natural and the Social Sciences. During the first year of undergraduate study, students would take three separate year-long courses in cultures and civilization, math, and a foreign language. In the sophomore year, the civilizations and language requirements would be continued, with a class in the natural sciences replacingthe math. During the junior year, the final two semesters of the civilization requirement would be fulfilled, as would the social sciences requirement. There would be no requirements fulfilled during the senior year. Eighteen hours of the proposed curriculum would be devoted to six three-hour courses in the study of cultures and civilizations. The first course would include classes on the origins of civilization, studying the tradional texts of ancient Mesoptamian, Egyptian, Indian, and Hebrew cultures. A second course would include readings from the ancient classical civilizations, continuing through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, ending with the Protestant Reformation. The third course would continue with readings from Descartes, Wordsworth, Austen, Marx, and Woolf. The fourth class under the area of cultures and civilizations would study intellectual traditions in the United States. Works by Ben Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Chief Joseph, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson would be studied alongside art works by Georgia O'Keefe and Frank Lloyd Wright. To satisfy the area's requirement in the studyof non-Western culture, students could choose from courses in the African, East Asian, Islamic, Latin American, or South Asian traditions. Many of the texts suggested by ""50-hours"" mirror those read in the Columbia College Literature Humanities and Contemporary Western Civilizations classes. In addition, works Columbia College students study in Art and Music Humanities would be studied in the same classes with the literary texts in the proposed curriculum. For example, the report suggests that in the segment of the course studying Enlightment, readings by Rousseau and Voltaire be studied along with Mozart's ""Don Giovani."" Embree and Carol Gluck, George Samson Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures, both served as ""readers"" for the NEH proposal according to the report's credits. Embree said he had not received a copy of the report, which was released last weekend. Gluck could not be reached for comment. ""Both Carol [Gluck] and I had a great deal to do with this,"" Embree said. ""We were consultants is what we really were.""In the National Endowment for the Humanities core proposal, each block on the chart represents one year of undergraduate study. White indicates the 50 required core hours; gray indicates time fora major and elective courses."
263,Music Humanities,Seminar to mold extended core course,1 February 1990,"By Kirsten Fermaslichv 0 Columbia's first attempt to create special inter-disciplinary classes to fulfill the Extended Core requirement will take place this Friday in a seminar for professors and graduate students from different academic fields. The seminar is the first of a series designed to create a class called ""Social Hierarchies in the Contem-porary West,"" according to Professor of History and Director of the Center of Women and Gender Studies Martha Howell, who organized the seminars. The series of seminars was funded by the Ford Foundation, according to Howell. The course is intended to be a follow-up to Contemporary Civiliza-tions, and will be designed in a similar fashion, with a syllabus of mostly primary sources and a probable class enrollment of 30 to 35 students, Howell said. Contemporary Civilizations, along with Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities, which are taught in a discussion-styleformat, constitute Columbia College's Core Curriculum. ""It does follow very nicely from [Contemporary Civilizations] . . . It's a study of the failures of [Contemporary Civilizations],"" Howell said. At the beginning of the fall semester, the Columbia College Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum, changed last year's Major Cultures requirement to an Extended Core requirement. The Extended Core requires Columbia College students to take either two courses in non-Western culture, or one nonWestern course and one class which deals with contemporary issues, such as race or gender. The Extended Core requirement is now fulfilled through a list of already existing classes on race, gender, and non-Western societies. - Because current Extended Core classes are often graduate-level classes, or classes otherwise inappropriate for introducing students to other cultures, Columbia College is attempting to create classes similar to Core Curriculum classes that will introduce students to different cultures or important modern topics, according to Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis. ""They're [Extended Core requirements] really designed to introduce students to another culture. The problem is we are implementing the program as we are developing it . . . it's been bumpy in its implementation. It's growing, it's developing,"" Yatrakis said. The social hierarchies class is the first class to be developed solely for the Extended Core requirement and will ideally serve as a model for other Extended Core classes, Howell said. ""It's the beginning of fundamentally confronting contemporary issues through the Core Curriculum,"" Howell said. The seminars being held this semester areintended to allow professors to discuss the intellectual issues and questions behind social hierarchies, and then to find readings that will address these issues, Howell said. The seminars will also allow the professors to better understand the contemporary issues and viewpoints different from their own areas of expertise, according to Assistant Professor of History Atina Grossman, who will participate in the seminar. ""People who focus on gender also need to focus on race,"" Grossman said. The committee's work will only serve as a model syllabus for the course in social hierarchies which will eventually arise from the seminars, according to Howell. The actual syllabi will vary widely from professor to professor, she added. ""At least we will have set up a kind of model that individual professors can tailor to fit their individual concerns,"" said Assistant Professor of Engllish and Comparative Literature Marcellus Blount, who will also attend the seminar. The course, which will ideally be taught in more than one section, will be offered next year, Howell said, although only about 60 students will probably be able to register for it. The number of students should increase each year as more professors are willing and able to offer the class, she said. Other professors attending the seminar are Assistant Professor of History Elizabeth Blackmar, Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature Sussan Winnett, Associate Professor of Anthropology Katherine Newman, Associate Professor of Sociology Mark Mizruchi, and Assistant Professor of Sociology Wanda Morris. Howell said that she chose the professors who will participate in the seminar.BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY: Alma Mater's little sister looks uptown from Straus Park, which will soon be renovated."
264,Music Humanities,A Columbia education summed up,16 May 1990,"By Joshua C. GilletteYou can do a lot in four years. To take just one example, between the years of 1470 and 1474 two Germans in the Danish Service, Didrick Pining and Hans Pothorst, undertook a voyage to Iceland and the west, supposedly at the request of the king of Portugal; the evidence does not show that they went beyond Greenland. To take another: between the years of 1986 and 1990,1 and a couple hundred other people went to Columbia. I know about the Pining-Pothorst pilgrimage because I looked it up in a big World History encyclopedia I got in high school. Such books are generally available; a Columbia education is pricier and harder to come by. While the former offers a chronologically arranged history of humankind from the Paleolithic Period to the present and an index of over 200 pages for quick, easy-to-read reference, the latter is valued more highly by society for its requirement that students engage and grapple with the eternal questions that arise out of the variegated fields of human endeavor, and for the fact that its binding does not break and cause it to fall off the shelf and send tumbling all the books it was holding up. But given these valuable features, how well does this education work? Can it be means-tested? Forget the stuff outside the classroom—nobody has to pay a hundred grand to make posters, play chess, help the disadvantaged or suck in their cheeks, wear maroon jackets and sing. Of course we learned more outside the classroom, from our peers. We're also in a very special period in our lives, full of wide-ranging emotion, activity and accomplishment; the deans appreciated our participation in the life of the College and will miss each of us in a different way; we'll treasure these memories forever; and we lived in the only college town in Manhattan—Morningside Heights. And Dial soap is better in several aspects from any other skin-cleansing product. Never mind the copy and agitprop—we need results, cold hard data on what a Columbia education teaches. With eight semesters of liberal education under my gown, what do I know now that I didn't before? And did it require four years that could have been more prudently allocated? In the interests of science and in the spirit of the oversimplification that inevitably results when journalism and academics mix, to prove that college students know a little something—and nothing more than that little something—about lots of things, and to save time for high schoolers considering putting off their own voyages to Iceland and the west until after college, I'd like to offer this handy resource for autodidacts: Everything I Learned in College. Columbia, like many colleges, has its wondrous moments of joyous selffulfillment and discovery (cf. your school's yearbook). Butrowing admissions process, the contrived orientation friendships, the rejection and depression and embarassment and frustrated ambition, the sleepless weeks, and all the rest of it, and get beyond Greenland. First Year, Fall: Contemporary Civilization: There's a Great Chain of Being, with Plato at the top and Nietzsche at the bottom; it is all the workers of the world have to lose. Logic and Rhetoric: It is a solecism to recklessly split an infinitive. French Conversation: Literature Humanities: Comedy is very old, but very old comedy is not very funny. Physical Education (soccer): Don't leave valuables in your locker. First Year, Spring: CC II: Humankind investigated God, then got bored and looked at nature, tired of that and examined people themselves, then, antsy as all get-out, trained the light of theoretical inquiry on language itself; Monty Python's Philosophy Song makes fundamental sense. Ethnicity in America: Immigrants came to America twice, in big waves, to look for work. Art Humanities: The Parthenon looks all evenly proportioned, but really was about to collapse; eventually, it did. Lit Hum II: Dead white men write good books Physical Education (CPR): Five compressions, one breath. Sophomore Year, Fall: Shakespeare I: Shakespeare's concerns included pressuring societal conventions and, secondarily, making stuff rhyme. America in the Era of Slaves and Jackson: Southern whites backed the enslavement of blacks so that they could have someone to feel superior towards; this is also the reason why many people voted for Andrew Jackson. Music Humanities: Summer is icumen in, and with swimsuit season just around the corner, sonata lot of time left to alto your looks by Chopin off the pounds. Unless you plan to be Haydn those unsightly bulges from all the strawberry Schubert you've been eating, you'll be melismarable; but now's your chants to tone that body, so get to your local Joy of Movement center on the double —meter's running. (MoneyBach guarantee) Plato: Plato, who may or may not have been Socrates (who may or may not have existed, but was a man, and since allmen are mortal, all men are Socrates), held that visible objects in the world are mere representational imitations of intangible Forms, abstract objects whose relation to each other and to those objects-in-the-world is a whole 'nother story. Physics for Poets: While randomness is increasing, so is the size of the universe, so that there's plenty of room for all the new and smaller items scientists continue to discover and show off to laypersons, whose lack of sophisticated understanding of their world is matched only by their ingratitude to the scientific community. Sophomore Year, Spring: Principles of Economics: Faced with the option of cleaning up trash in a public park, the rational person will ask: What's in it for me? Intro to French Lit: Roman History: You could really get ahead in the Roman Army if you knew people. East European Jewry 1772-1917: Liberal European Jews joined the Socialist Bund, while some conservative European Jews helped the Russian authorities draft their fellows—l think. Physics for poets II: Scientists want to know three things about objects: what they are made of, what forces affect them, and what effect they exert on things around them. (For example, government grants are made of money, they are affected by the usefulness of research to the military-industrial-death-gel-producing complex, and they exert a positive force in the lives of those who receive them.) Junior Year, Fall: Anthropology: Pre-marital sex is not a problem, but premarital dining is, among the members of the Brazilian Yanamamo tribe. US History Since 1945: Everyone in the 1950s agreed that Alger Hiss was bad but not much else was; in the 1960s they realized he was about the only OK thing; and then there was Watergate. US Labor during the 20th century: The AFL/CIO practices craft unionism, but the International Workers of the World (""the Wobblies""—a mnemonic device that gave this class bonus educational value) wanted to build One Big Union, and so would take anyone; essentially, the IWW threw a union and noone showed up. Topics in Asian Civilization, the Middle East, and India: There is a dynamism and creativity to the cultures of these nations that fires the mind so strongly that it can produce six disquisitions worth four points in one night. Metaphysics: There's no such thing—those things we think are ideas are actually the neurophysiological symptoms of John Jay Pub food. Philosophy Writing Workshop: Irony works better than sarcasm. Yeah, right. Junior Year, Spring: Radical Tradition: The Abolition movement was like the Civil Rights Movement in some ways, different in others. Civil Rights Research Topics: Pervasive jury discrimination rigged the American justice system against blacks from thestart; things have changed with Supreme Court rulings, but discrimination in selection is still tough to prove. And, according to Richard Kluger's book Simple Justice, Jack Greenberg was a steely-eyed, square-jawed firebrand with a cool analytical mind in the 19505. Nietzsche: It's all relative, even the proposition that it's all relative. And that depends on where you're coming from. Oh, plus art is dead, and the sensual and formal drives combine in people to form the play impulse—the prime mover of MTV. American Urban Politics: Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Senior Year, Fall: Afro-American Literature: If the poem has references to jazz, it's probably by Langston Hughes. British History: Britain grew into quite an empire. Philosophy of Language: In certain graduate philosophy courses, you must always attend class and be very sure of deadlines. Politics of Policy Making: In certain undergraduate political science courses, however, you can go to class only twice and get an A. Senior Year, Spring: Opera and revolution: German Literature in World Context: Revolting people tend to write and produce opera, though Beethoven wasn't as boorish as Wagner. Fascism: It could happen here if we don't look out, because the Germans and Italians weren't dummies—they, in fact, cared more about a candiate's positions and politics than his marriage and hair color. British History: Britain declined from quite an empire to not so great an empire. Attitude, Action, and Reason: To justify their behavior, many people point to reasons which, if they thought about it,would emerge as silly; everything we do can be reduced to motions of the body; emotions are very complicated combinations of sensation, belief, physiological reaction, behavior, and judgements; therefore, I should just own up and say I used to hit my little brother because I felt like it. Comparative Modern Fiction: The modern novel decentered the subject, played out the subjective obsessions of the modern artist in highly-charged prose, and was, frankly, in certain cases much longer than it really needed to be. Glib reductionism? Maybe. But keep in mind, ours was the MTV generation, nursed on TV news soundbites and told we weren't culturally literate, that we had know-nothing American minds just barely ajar and snapping shut fast. What did manage to sneak in were factoids, bereft of context and proportion, they said. That I am able to pluck complete sentences out of the rapidly-shifting video-like montage that is my memory of these courses is, I propose, a modest but notable coup. Perhaps as my fellow graduates tally their totals, I'll emerge the deviant one. Perhaps process is more important than product, becoming educated more important than being educated. Maybe the typical Columbia graduate in 1990 remembers more than a few disjointed, impressionistic fact-blotches or conceptettes from each class. Columbia does attract people with uncanny abilities to sustain intense interest in the recondite minutiae of esoteric topics—witness Modern Times writers (and readers). And some people did tape record the lectures in my economics class. So I could be wrong. But I suspect that for most of us, the one other thing I learned in Comparative Modern Fiction, from Nabokov's Lolita, wraps up the collegiate enterprise as we underwent it:""I am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing everything."" Actually, I got that out of a book of quotations. Q.E.D.Joshua C. Gillette is a former Spectator Editor-in-Chief and will graduate Cum Laude from Columbia College today."
265,Music Humanities,A Cultural Mecca,21 February 1991,"By Tim GriffinIndeed, Columbia lives up to its brochures. A Bernardo Bertolucci film premieres in New York City. Immediate-ly, a mass exodus of refined Columbians follow the burning cloud of culture down the one line. Exclamations and fervor abound on the campus (secretly, students rejoice at the prospect of the refined date: an alternative to the MoMA, old hat). Surely, we educate ourselves in the cultural mecca of the United States, if not the world. Surely, we fulfill the prophesies of Schiller, we complete the task set before us in the spirit of the Core Curriculum: we cultivate ourselves, in all the multiplicity of our internal possibility. And perhaps, with continued effort, we achieve the internal balance and moderation glorified in the Biblical text of our Columbia education, ""The Republic""—albeit a balance attained through the exposure to art forms which Plato himself might have called ""illusion."" But is it only art which might be called ""illusion"" in this case? Is there the possibility that, somehow, Columbia students are not achieving such a cultivation and balance, but instead are subtly and nimbly defying the supple sheen of culture, intellectualism, metropolitanism and ""IvyLeague-ism"" endowed upon them by the American media and groups such as the MLA (although the latter half of that statement may in fact also be an illusion, or perhaps even a third-order illusion? We, like the artists of New York, bumblingly attempt to embody aesthetically the ideas of the latest French philosophers. How truly cultivated, how truly cosmopolitan we are!)? In this unlikely scenario, the vast majority of Columbia students would not engage in the cultural events of the city. They would remain on campus, rent the occasional movie, hang out at local bars, ""Twin Peaks"" in the dormitory lounge would be an artistically stimulating evening. Although this scenario is unlikely, let us, for the sake of argument, assume that it is factual. How do students at this sort of Columbia expose themselves to New York's artistic community? With respect to the Columbia education, they expose themselves via class requirements for Art and Music Humanities. They study art history, go to museums, become artistically refined and hang Klimt posters on their walls. Thus the impression of art's spirit is made upon the Columbian's soul, and an appreciation for the visual arts is permanently engendered. As one former Art Humanities professor said, ""This course will make you forever good at cocktail parties."" Indeed, the Columbian soul finally achieves the ends of its education. We actually see this cultivation in action as Columbia students turn to the city and investigate its cultural events. Upon finishing the Art and Music Humanities requirements, the most refined students sprint to the nearest newsstand and pick up a New York Times. ""Perfect,"" they say, grinning with exuberance, ""there's an exhibition at the MoMA, Ashkenazy is playing at Alice Tully, and Film Forum has a Bergman retrospective. Now who should I go with?"" The students are excited that they fullyintegrate themselves into the New York cultural scene, and that Art and Music Humanities were not rooted in a sort of historicism in which current trends andproblems of art and music are for the most part neglected. Their education encourages them to go beyond the established arenas of culture; not only do they go to Carnegie Hall to hear Beethoven, but they frequentcutting-edge artistic scenes like Film Forum to see a Bertolucci. So we see the Columbia students' cultivation completed, because it is important to the students themselves. They study the history of art and music but want to go beyond it, making it a real part of their lives, applying this knowledge to current trends in the arts, keeping up to date with cultural events, realizing that there is more to art than just the proclaimed masters such as Picasso or Beethoven. They scour the pages of the New York Times (a hotbed for cultural alternatives) in order to find readings by the current literary figures, because they know that art strengthens the soul. Most importantly, their cultivated souls demand that they educate themselves through these cultural engagements, thereby avoiding an unfortunate situation: a body of students experiencing a purely historical liberal arts education, ironically failing to go into the city and gain first-hand experience of the liberal arts.One of the mastersGrand illusion"
266,Music Humanities,Make Columbia a recommendable institution,15 May 1991,"By Edward LipmanStrange things happen to graduating seniors. Not being a scientist (or a philosopher), I will not try to give an explanation of these odd occurrences. I shall simply relate the facts. About a week ago I found myself at a cocktail party discussing life and happiness with a high school junior from Pennsylvania. Without any conscious desire to do so, I began to do something that readers of my column would think unlikely from the author of ""Right on"": I endeavored to convince this intelligent, well-mannered, and attractive young lady to apply to Columbia! In itself, this might not be so startling; it could, among other things, be put down to the wily machinations of Messrs. Johnny Walker and Jim Beam (the occasion in question was, after all, a cocktail party). But several days later, I discovered a missive from the Columbia alumni admissions people in the morning mail, containing a form letter inviting me to sign on as some sort of Columbia representative to high-schoolers in my area. Without premeditation, I eagerly scanned the letter,filled out the enclosed form, mailed it, and began looking forward to snaring New York City's best and brightest for good old Alma Mater. Can this be? The author of so many diatribes against the woeful state of Columbia becoming an honest to God booster? The man who has attacked administration, faculty, and students for their moral bankruptcy and utter disregard for learning? Yes. My purpose in my polemical columns was to try to make sure that Columbia would remain an institution worth attending. And after my four years, I can say—with somereservations-that Columbia offers an excellent education that holds its own against all comers, including the mighty Harvard. To begin with, our Core Curriculum is a real curriculum in which one reads real books in a generally straightforward fashion. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization remain challenging, serious courses where students are introduced to great worksEdward Lipman, a Spectator columnist, will graduate from Columbia College today.of philosophy, political theory, and literature. For all its faults, Logic and Rhetoric remains an intensive exercise in the writing of English prose. Music Humanities and Art Humanities remain centered upon the great music and art of Western civilization. ""Street Slang 101"" will not yet fulfill the language requirement, nd the science requirement promises to be v even better as it is expanded to two full years. But the Core is, thankfully, not all of one's education at Columbia. Much time is spent taking courses in one's major, and for the student with any scholarly inclination majors abound where the wisdom and teaching of great scholars are readily available. Though the English and history departments care too little about undergraduates and all too much \ about radical politics, small but academically outstanding departments such as classicseagerly welcome the interested student. Although the elimination of the geography and the linguistics departments is to be deplored, and no doubt indicates an alarming trend that must be fought against, scholarship is not yet dead at Columbia. Beyond the classroom there is New York. I never cease to wonder at the transformation that so many of my friends have undergone during their four years here; the intellectual and social sophistication of New York seems to leave no one untouched, even if few Columbians are to be seen in used bookstores, at the opera, or at off-off-Broadway shows. Unlike the boutique colleges (such as, let us say, Bennington), Columbia does have a diverse student body. Diverse, that is, in a good sense, not diverse in the sense of a quota-filled experiment in social engineering.I would be unfair to my Muse if I neglected to mention the bad parts of Columbia. The dorms are terrible, mostly due to the animallike habits of the students who live in them. Students who come from morally conservative backgrounds will find myriad and insistent invitations to sin that their parents could never have dreamed of when they wrote out the check to Columbia. Our school lacks the elegance and refinement still present in some measure at some of our more conspicuous Ivy brethren, and any visions prospective students have of well-dressed, intellectual undergraduates sitting around in front of a fire drinking sherry with a great scholar had better be laid to rest without further ado. Although the Core Curriculum is quite good on paper, the quality of the actual classes depends all too much on one's teachers: I, for instance, had a frightfullyrotten Music Humanities class, a horrible first semester of Physics for Poets, and an equally atrocious Logic and Rhetoric class; I also had a mediocre Contemporary Civilization class. Every other Core course that I took, however, was truly first-rate. Indeed, with the exception of two electives in addition to the abovenamed Core courses, every class I took at Columbia was first-rate. But when it comes right down to it, Columbia offered me more of an education than I ever could have taken advantage of. And for that, I trust I may be forgiven a certain sentimentality as I take leave of the Light Blue (even if I never did go to a football game or sing ""Roar, Lion, Roar""!). Right on, Columbia? Not quite, but close."
267,Music Humanities,"The ""core"" of the Core, or Humming your way to class",29 August 1991,"By Kristina Nye and David A. Shimkin Spectator Staff WritersThe first-year class at Columbia College is usually made up of two groups of students--one that is intellectually stimulated by the prospect of two very full years of courses devoted to the ideas and accomplishments of Western civilization and one that gets queasy at the mere mention of' 'dead white men'' like Nietzche or Raphael. Whichever group you belong to, you may find it necessary to understand the purpose of the Core Curriculum and how it will effect your academic, or not-so-academic lives at Columbia. For those of you who are not familiar with the origins of the Core Curriculum, you may be interested to know that the Core has existed at Columbia for more than half a century. Starting with the inception of the Contemporary Civilization course in 1919 which dealt with war and peace issues, the Core later included Literature Humanities in 1937 and Art and Music Humanities in 1947. For all of its tradition, however, the Core sparks controversy. Some students have complained about the exclusivity of the Core and its emphasis on the accomplishments of Western males. Evidence of student opposition to this Western white male emphasis was obvious when studentssnuck onto the roof of Butler Library two years ago and unfurled a banner with about ten names of female authors such as Sappho, Jane Austen, and Virginia Wolfe to hang above the engraved names of Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, et al. Since that time, the Core has changed rapidly in an attempt to meet the needs of a changing student body. In addition to a science, foreign language, and physical education requirement, the Core in 1988 replaced the Remoteness Requirement, a requirementfor courses outside one's major, with the Extended Core, or a non-Western requirement. Of course, despite changes in the curriculum, criticism abounds. One claim is that the Extended Core's courses have a narrow focus. For example, you may want to take a course with a broad overview of Japanese culture, yet the only course offered that relates to Japanese culture is The Rise of Militarism in Japan 1900-1930. Get the picture? In response to criticism and long-winded, heated debates, Columbia has made a concerted effort within the past few years to reevaluate the Extended Core, by creating various committees, such as the Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum, to discuss changing the scope of the Core. The faculty and administration has sought to add to the Core rather than replace or eliminate the criticized aspects. Western civilization now lives in peace with non-Western civilization at Columbia College's Core courses. Before we go into our pithy guide to the Core curriculum, there are two very important rules you should remember: 1. How interestirg or how easy/difficult a course is depends a lot on the instructor. Instructors range from tenured professors to fuzzy-cheeked grad students, and teaching and grading styles vary from section to section. 2. Don't forget rule number one. Now, on with our explanations of those vague names of classes you all have to section for. Humanities CI001: Otherwise known as Lit-Hum, many first-year students take this course during their first year because rumor has it that it's easier than Contemporary Civilization (see CI002). But like most Core courses, the level of difficulty varies and depends a lot on the instructor (see rules 1 and 2). If you take Lit-Hum during your first year, one of your first assignments will be to wadethrough Homer's Iliad. No small feat. Most often heard Lit-Hum statement: Where can I buy Cliffs Notes around here? Humanities CIOO2. Known as Contemporary Civilization, or CC (not to be confused with Columbia College, or CC), this course surveys the history and development of European philosophy, otherwise known as the dead white male stuff. Although the books at times seem dull and indecipherable, they do often promote lively and interesting discussions at coffee parties. Honest. Most often heard CC statement: I read MOST of it. Humanities 1121. A.k.a. Art-Hum, the course spans the history of Western art from the earliest Greek works to contemporary Spanish art. Much of the class time is spent looking at slides of famous works and discussing them, and the general consensus among Art-Hum veterans is that it is a fairly interesting and fun course because you can sound erudite from finding the meaning of a huge blue spot worth millions in a museum. But remember, it all depends on your instructor (once again, rules 1 and 2). Most often heard Art-Hum statement: Well, I think it represents... Humanities 1123. Otherwise know as Music Hum, the course is a lot like Art-Hum, but instead of peering at slides of famous art, you'll be listening to tapes of classical Western music. Many students also enjoy this often relaxed course and some instructors incoporate the classical works of Elvis Presley into the music list, but remember... Well, there you go. These four courses are the backbone or ""core"" of the Core. Though you'll have several other curriculum requirements in addition to these (yes, several), none will be shared by as many students at one time. Consider it a bonding experience and always keep your chin up, chest out, and enter your first Core curriculum classroom knowing you are continuing an old tradition.U» M.n.ori.l Library, m ce-tr,. ad minlsl r.

268,Music Humanities,Core should encompass global issues,24 September 1991,"By Mitchell M. WongPerhaps the greatest accomplishment of Columbia University is the formation of the Core Curriculum, which offers a strong and fundamental understanding of Western philosophy and thought. For over half a century, it has been the paragon of social education and the envy of countless institutions of higher learning. However, the value of the Core simply cannot be measured by comparison to other syllabi, but by its utility in the real world. Under such scrutiny, it seems that the Core is rapidly becoming more and more archaic in the ace-deration of the fast paced world we live in today. The Core Curriculum was created in response to World War I in 1919 with the birth of the Contemporary Civilization syllabus. The goal of the course was to educate students in recognizing (and, if possible, nullifying) the causes of dissension and violent resolution. This was to be accomplished by requiring students to read pieces of literature which influenced the development of current society. Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities were added to the Core in 1937 to supplement Contemporary Civilizationthrough studies of the creative spirit in Western culture. Since then, the Core has not been significantly modified. However, the world has changed dramatically over those 54 years. The 1990s preside oVer a world of incalculable speed and never-ending change. The emergence of a global economy and unhindered communication has shattered the supposedly impenetrable and eternal geographical barriers which, until now, have sheltered the complacent solitude of the United States. The West is no longer the sole cause of international events. The worldwide concern over the Gulf War clearly demonstrates this point. As for the Core's present usefulness, did it offer any insight into the delicate policies and decisions made by Iraq, Israel, the Middle Eastern countries, and the rest of the world during the Gulf War? Could the attitudes of the Chinese communist hardliners who crushed and hunted the Tienanmen Square protesters be discerned using the Core as a guide? How much of the Core could be applied to examining the mutation of democracy into a bloody series of slaughters by Monrovian leaders? When these questions are asked, it seems that although the Core offers an advantageous overview of Western culture, if provides, at best, a myopic understanding of African, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern cultures. The extended Core is incapable of covering such cultures with the same depth the Core covers Western civilization. With such a deficiency, how can the Core successfully fulfill its goal of unearth-ing the multicultural roots of modern day society for inspection? It is time for the Core to be rewritten with a global consideration in mind. Significant texts and works of art from non-Western cultures should be completely integrated into the Core and not taught separately as an addendum Extended Core. This should be done even if Core courses have to be expanded into additional terms or hours. The priceless advantage of having such different works taught side byside is that it allows a student to develop a deeper appreciation of the intricate similarities, differences, and parallels between familiar Western culture and the less familiar nonWestern cultures. In lieu of the greater time commitment generated, the Extended Core requirement and the language requirement could be dropped since the former would already be introduced into the Core and the latter is simply a less efficient way of imparting an understanding of a foreign culture.Another arrangement may be to abridge the current Core by replacing works which address only one viewpoint with those that cover multiple topics or by condensing studies under a general category using only specific passages of texts or just fewer pieces of music or art. For example, Hrosvit's plays could be replaced by Tales of the Arabian Nights, which is (more enjoyably) told from the viewpoint of a woman and a non-Western culture. Monastic music need not be repeated ad nauseam whenjust an example or two of early Western music could be used in its place. The valuable time spent on repetition could be better used for a broader range of study. It is only after we have been rearmed in our knowledge of the ways of the world that we can safely assume our capacity to disempower those who would bring about conflict through unfamiliarity, misunderstanding, and trust.Mitchell M.

269,Music Humanities,CC still trying to restore fellowships,3 October 1991,"By David ShayneDespite a seven-month search, Columbia administrators have been unable to find money to restore the Chamberlain fellowships for graduate students teaching Core Curriculum courses. The Chamberlain Fellowship, an incentive for graduate students and assistant professors to teach Core Curriculum courses for six semesters, was discontinued last spring for graduate students because of lack of funding. Core Curriculum coursesinclude Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. The fellowship, originally slated to be discontinued in spring 1989, was extended for an additional year with funding from a one-time donation from Columbia College Dean Jack Greenberg's office, according to Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis. The fellowship will not be reinstated next semester, but the option to restore it remains if funding becomes available, Yatrakis said. ""It would depend on the budget for next year,"" she said. Eliminating the fellowship was a mistake because the quality of the Core Curriculum is an integral part of the Columbia education, according to Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History J.W. Smit, who is head of Contemporary Civilization department. "" I felt it was a bad example to cut the central piece of the Columbia College education,"" Smit said. ""I felt the savings should have been made elsewhere."" Smit, who resigned from his position as chair of the Contemporary Civilization department after the fellowship was canceled, said he agreed to return to his post in July because Greenberg promised to raise funds for the fellowship. Greenberg's promise, however, does not guarantee that funds will be raised, Smit said. ""Obviously, he cannot promise me that at a certain point we willhave the money,"" he said. The fellowship for assistant professors remained even though it was canceled for graduate students. Smit said the cancellation of the fellowship for graduate students showed that ""preceptors do not have the clout of other groups."" When the cancellation was announced last spring, several preceptors said the cuts were unexpected and unfair. ""Because Dean Greenberg had restored the money temporarily, some of the preceptors felt the fellowship would continue,"" Smit said. Some of the first-year preceptors said they had not expected to receive the Chamberlin Fellowship. ' 'When I interviewed last spring,they didn't mention it to me,"" said Laura Gaughran, a preceptor for Contemporary Civilization. ' 'When I entered the program, it was completely moot. I didn't even feel like they were taking it away from me."" ""No one said anything to me [about the fellowship],"" said Preceptor John Ransom. ""No one has even asked me if I'm stickingaround next year."" If the Chamberlain fellowship is restored, Smit said he would like it to become a postdoctoral award to encourage graduate students who have completed their dissertations to teach for an additional year, Smit said. While in the past, departments granted graduate students annual one-year fel-lowships, some departments are now offering five-year fellowships, Smit said. The five-year fellowships will encourage graduate students to teach Core Curriculum courses for their final two years, Smit said, while completing their dissertations in seven years. Smit said he thinks students should beencouraged to teach for a third year after receiving their doctorate. ' 'When they teach for only two years, there is too much coming and going in the department,"" he said.Jacob Smit"
270,Music Humanities,"Registering patterns: long lines, aggravation, the works",1 September 1992,"By Elizabeth Berke Spectator Staff WriterSo, you think you've had horrible experiences? Nightmarish days? Terrible weeks? I would venture a rather substantial wager that nothing in your past experience will compare with the upcoming weeks of registra-tion. Every year, the administration comes up with a plan to improve the process. This year, the lines will be shorter, and everything will be organized, and everyone will know exactly where to go, when, and why. They say that every year. Maybe this year they'll be right. The basic process is that you have to sign up forcer-tain classes such as Physical Education, Logic and Rhetoric, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Contemporary Civilization (those in the core curriculum) before you actually register. This process of choosing core curriculum classes is called automated sectioning, and from there it moves on. Registration takes place after classes have begun, enabling students to explore a variety of classes and make an informed decision before they go through the computerized administrative process that commits them to a defined schedule. Those in the know would advise students to get to the lines early in the morning and toward the beginning of the designated time slot in order to avoid the long lines of the last minute rush. Students who are confused about the registration process should turn to their student advisers, who will give them detailed information about how to make sense of the pencil book, the course guide, and the registration process. In addition to students advisers, faculty advisers can be very helpful for students as they choose their course of study. Also, these professorial advisors will provide the needed signature of approval on their registration forms after students have decided upon classes and the double-checked the schedule to make sure there are no time conflicts. From there, only lines await those brave enough to have made it this far. While it may be frustrating and time-consuming and stressful, it is not impossible, and those going through registration for the first time should remember that everyone else has had to go through it at least once before. And you have it easy now. Registration used to be held in the Old Gym, not the Lion's Den of Ferris Booth Hall. Imagine finding the Old Gym during your first week on campus. For one thing, it's underground, and for another thing, there's also a Levien Gym inside the Dodge Physical Fitness Center. And, there's no sign saying ""Old Gym"" on the front of the doors leading to the Old Gym. See, it could be worse. But it'll get better. After automated sectioning, classes start. And then registration, then midterms, then Winter Break, then summer. See it's not that bad. And the best part is, you only have to do it eight times. Good luck."
271,Music Humanities,Get to the core of Columbia,1 September 1992,"By Elliot Regenstein Spectator Designated FlunkyColumbia's Core Curriculum is famous or infamous, depending on who you ask. But it all depends on how you approach it. Treat it well and it will give you a lifetime of pleasure, but treat it poorly and it will kick your butt. There are a few basic facts about life in the Core Curriculum which are absolutely essential; —If your teacher is great, your class will be great; if your teacher stinks, you're in trouble. The curriculum is very strong, but a lame instructor is certainly capable of ruining it. Most instructors are very good, and there are ways to get out of bad situations. With Contemporary Civilization (CC) and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), which are full-year classes, your best bet is to suffer one semester and create a time conflict for the second semester. With Art Humanities (Art Hum) or Music Humanities (Music Hum), which are one semester apiece, you may have to drop the class and start again later. One campus celebrity is rumored to have dropped Music Hum after one week every semester he's been here. —It will be much better for your sanity if you don'tstart comparing your workload to that of your friends in other sections. Some instructors believe that reading 400 pages of deep philosophy every night is the only way to truly experience college; with others, reading the back cover is basically enough. Unless your teacher is an unfair jerk, don't think about it; this is college, and you're supposed to do a lot of work. —Speaking of which, it's really a good idea to do your reading. The books are fantastic, and you can really get a lot out of these classes if you try. Often it's possible to slide by without working too hard. But you'll feel cheated afterwards. Hate to sound like your mom, but it's really true. Obviously, if it's a Friday night and you're choosing between the Village and Voltaire, you'd be a fool to stay cooped up in your room; but if it's Tuesday night and the only thing on TV is ""Ishtar,"" for crying out loud, do your work! Anyway, now that I've completely alienated all of you, here's a quick look at what the Core Curriculum entails: CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION is the heart and soul of the Core. CC dates back to 1919, and incorporates the work of almost every noteworthy dead white male philosopher. In many ways, it'sthe hardest Core class; many elect to take CC sophomore year following Lit Hum, while others dive right into it (and a lunatic few take both at the same time). The typical CC experience will be something like this: you'll do a whopping amount of reading, go to class, discuss the reading with 15 to 20 worn-out classmates who also did the same whopping reading, and then you'll go home to do another whopping reading assignment. There are variations on this theme. For one thing, virtually every section will have: a) someone who always does the reading but never says anything, b) someone who never does the reading but still always has something to say, and c) people who never do the reading and never say anything either. LITERATURE HUMANITIES dates back to 1937, and is patterned after CC, except that instead of philosophy, you'll be reading great works of literature. This makes it somewhat easier than CC, just because the reading is a bit easier (in two years, you'll feel no shame about saying, ""Yeah, I thought Goethe was a good read, but Kant just put me to sleep.""). The major book the two classes have in commonis Plato's ""Republic,"" which is definitely worth reading twice. ART HUMANITIES and MUSIC HUMANITIES are only one semester, but are similar in style; a small class, working its way through the white male history of some cultural genre (art for ArtHum and music for Music Hum, for those of you who weren't paying attention). I say white male history because traditionally, nonwhite males have been poorly represented in the Core. In an attempt to remedy the situation, Columbia has created the Cultures and Issues requirement (formerly known as the Extended Core or Major Cultures requirement). Unfortunately, there's really no way you can learnan appreciation of every culture in four short years; as it is, you barely come to an appreciation of dead white male culture, and that's only one small piece of the puzzle. Those who end up majoring in something like sociology, anthropology, history, or other related areas have a much better chance of taking more than the required number of classes in non-DWM cultures. Those in the hard sciences will probably fulfill their Cultures and Issues requirement, and that will be it. Speaking of science, there is a science requirement, as well as a language requirement, and a PE requirement. How you fulfill these will be up to your personal taste, and you can use any number of criteria to choose how you go about it.For instance, I knew someone who took Italian for his language requirement, simply because it was the only Latin-based language for which the introductory class didn't meet on Fridays. The language requirement, unlike virtually everything else at Columbia, can be placed out of. Those are your basic requirements right there. Obviously, you should read the Bulletin pretty carefully; if you're the kind of person who'd read this far in an article like this, you probably would have done that anyway. The key to your Core Curriculum is, be ready for a lot of work, do that work, and appreciate it. And if you find that the Core Curriculum is not for you, the information number for Brown University is (401) 863-1000."
272,Music Humanities,B-School begins new curriculum,25 September 1992,"By Janet Frankston Spectator Staff WriterAfter more than two years of development, the School of Business implemented its new curriculum earlier this semester, and after two weeks, many have given the redesigned classes a high rating. The Masters of Business Administration (MBA) program has been restructured to integrate such themes as globalization, business and efficient management, and human resources, said Geoffrey Heal,vice dean of the school. These four philosophical foundations will be integrated into every class offered attheßusiness School, including the 11 core classes required of all students. ""The themes are all best covered by the integration into the bread and butter courses, which the students all have and want to take,"" Heal said. Input forthe ""Curriculum forthe 21st Century"" came from students, alumni, faculty members, recruiting companies, and faculty members from peer institutions, accord-ing to Linda Green, former vice dean of the Business School and professor of operations management. In addition, a special committee was formed to design the curriculum. After many months of communication among the faculty, the curriculum had a 100 percent approval rating. ""We had a set of meetings with every single division,"" Green said. ""It was difficult and painful, but worth the effort. This will be an ongoing effort from now on. Busi-ness is always evolving, and we need to change because the business world is changing so fast."" Following several modifications, the special committee formed to design the curriculum sat down with the different divisions of the school in the summer of 1991 and set additional modifications based on the outcomes of the discussions. ""The comments, suggestions, and input was a long process. In the end, not everyone agreed with every point, but as a whole agreed to endorse the new curriculum because it was better than what existed,"" she said. While new students to the Business School may not directly notice the changes, the faculty has made major changes in each individual course. ""This will make more work for the faculty, but most see it as a major improvement, which will be more meaningful to the students,"" Green said. The faculty will be goingthrough more intense collaboration with each other, according to Professor of Finance Bruce Greenwald. ""Some faculty members are nervous [about teaching] and are ending up in my classes,"" Greenwald said. Other core classes will be taught by senior, or tenured, faculty which were formerly taught by junior faculty. While the faculty will have no formal training, they will start togive more thought to what they will put into their courses, Greenwald said. ""More effort of conscious design will be put into the classes,"" Greenwald said. Members of the faculty will update every Business School course. ""Every core course has been rethought. Two thirds of the faculty had to rethink and redevelop their courses,"" Heal said. ""The faculty has spent thousands of hours in new course development."" The new ideas incorporated into the courses are new to the classroom and are based on pragmatic use in the real business world. Finance classes have been redeveloped to reflect needs in business. ""No one ever teaches how to do things like that in a classroom,"" Greenwald said. The students have been in class now for nearly two weeks, but the reaction seems to be positive so far, Heal said. ""It is too early to judge; we will have to wait until the end of the semester to really evaluate it,"" Heal said. Students seem to be favorable to the new changes, but may not be able to see the results yet, said Edmond Sanctis, a second-year Business School student. ""I see more of a concerted effort to connect the four themes into the curriculum,"" Sanctis said. ""It will take a couple of years before the changes kick in, but I can see the efforts. They will turn out to be a valuable change.""SPECI'ATOR/MIKE FEIN Chair of Music Humanities Elaine Sisman and Professor of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry Jordan Spencer were presented with the 1992 Great Teacher Awards by the Society of Columbia Graduates last night at the Columbia Club.

273,Music Humanities,Professors honored at ceremony,25 September 1992,"By Leyla Kokmen Spectator Staff WriterMembers of the Columbia community celebrated the University's tradition of excellence in teaching last night at the presentation of the 1992 Great Teacher Awards. About 80 Columbia alumni, faculty members, and administrators attended a ceremony to watch Chair of Music Humanities Eleine Sisman and Professor of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistiy Jordan Spencer receive awards from the Society of Columbia Graduates. ""I realized that I was anticipating this evening because in many ways this is an exemplary event,"" said Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis in an introductory speech. ""This is an event when Columbia alumni get together and celebrate what we do, and that is, teach. Teaching is the most important thing that we do,"" she said.Sisman, who has taught at Columbia since 1982, is the first representative of the music department to receive the award. ""I feel only the most simple and basic thing,"" she said. ""I love teaching and I'm very glad that my efforts have been awarded in this way. Being able to teach bright students about music is an unsurpassable experience."" Spencer, who joined the faculty of the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) in 1964, said he is excited to return solely to teaching after spending the past six years as chair of the department of chemical engineering, and that receiving the award has strengthened his enthusiasm. ""It certainly strongly reinforces my attempts to teach well,"" he said. ""Teaching at Columbia has been an amazing experience,"" he added. Speakers at last night's ceremony also included University Provost Jonathan Cole, SEAS Vice DeanJohn Render, and Arthur Weinstock, CC '41, the president of the Society of Columbia Graduates. The process of selecting the recipients of the Great Teacher Award at Columbia College begins when the Committee on Undergraduate Teaching, along with Yatrakis, recommends three candidates to the Society of Columbia Graduates Committee on Awards. The committee then discussesthe candidates, reads their comprehensive resumes and histories, and selects the winner who must be confirmed by the Board of Directors. ""We don't base it on any one single thing,"" Weinstock said. ""It's more of a composite of their work: what the students think, what their fellow professors think, and what the dean of the faculty thinks,"" he added. Weinstock said the process of choosing a winner is similar for the SEAS recipient."
274,Music Humanities,"$100,000 of Core grant to pay for capital needs",9 November 1992,"By Brett Cohen Contributing WriterThe first $ 100.000 of a $500,000 grant which was given to Columbia College earlier this semester to strengthen the Core Curriculum will be used primarily for capital expenditures. The committee met Nov. 6 to clarify the allocation plans for the Fairchild Foundation grant. University Provost Jonathan Cole applied for the grant when the University did not have sufficient funds for Core Curriculum necessities such as compact disc stations for the Music Humanities department, andprojectors for the Art Humanities department. In the future, committee members plan to shift spending towards curriculum development, but will spend most of the first $100,000 on capital needs such as photocopiers, computers, books, and video tapes. The committee plans to spread expenditures from the three-year grant over five years. Curriculum development will become more of a priority after capital necessities are met, according to Associate Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures Haruo Shirane, who chairs the committee.""We anticipate more curriculum development in the sccond and third year,"" he said. Columbia College Coordinator Eileen Gillooly, a committee member, said she brought her home computer into the Contemporary Civilization/Literature Humanities office because the department needed a computer. Other professors described similar situations in which their departments could not afford computer printers or photocopying machines. ""To be very frank, the grant was absolutely essential for the continuation and maintenance of a high quality core,"" Shiranc said. Because the subject matter of the core courses falls under more than one department, funds for the entire program arc difficult to find.""In a time of financial difficulty, interdepartmental programs lose out,"" Shirane said. Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature James Mirollo, director of the Literature Humanities program and a committee member, said the grant was greatly needed to keep the core in existence. ""'Without this kind of regular infusion of resources, it's difficult to keep the core going. This is what keeps the core alive, instead of it be ing cither starved to death or stagnant."" The future curriculum expenditures. although not finalized, will pay for teacher training, and training for graduate students who intend to teach core courses, Shirane said.Columbia College seniors converged on the steps yesterday afternoon for the annual yearbook portrait."
275,Music Humanities,Core should not be restructured,25 November 1992,"To the Editor: In the Nov. 19 issue of the Spectator, Rodney Crump writes that black students should ""overreact"" against classes which contain the writings of such white thinkers as ""Nietzsche, Darwin, and Marx"" in their syllabi. Mr. Crump argues that Columbia professors have rejected ""the cornerstone contributions Africa made to civilization"" in favor of studies of these and other white philosophers. Unfortunately, Mr. Crump doesn't realize that studies in Core classes should not be chosen in a manner that is politically correct in any way. Nietzsche, Darwin, Marx, and other intellectuals are studied in classes like Contemporary Civilization because their writings are some of the most brilliant, revolutionary, and fascinating discoveries and ideas ever put down on paper. They are not being studied because they are white. They are being studied because their work is seminal in the course of civilization. And the civilizations that their ideas have influenced are worldwide;these authors have not just been limited to influencing white European society. For example, Marxism has influenced political leaders in countries such as Russia, China, Africa, and Latin America, while Darwinism is the foundation of the modern evolutionary theory that we know today. Nobody can say truthfully that these innovative thinkers had no impact on worldwide civilization. What Mr. Crump implies is that the entire Core Curriculum should be restructured in order to contain studies of important African works of literature. But once education becomes politically oriented, then its value becomes diluted. Should Columbia students not study Wagner in Music Humanities classes because he was one of the most vicious anti-Semites who ever existed? Or should the study of Shakespeare in Literature Humanities be disregarded because the title character of the play Othello, who is a black Moor, is a tragic figure, and commits murder? Mr. Crump's objective does not seem to be to enrich history, but to cover up its brilliant edges with appeasement. He seeks to overlook art in favor of a political ideology whose only purpose is to encourage diversity in the curriculum, without encouraging innovation. Great works of art stand on their own individually, and are universally great at the same time. That Mr. Crump is offended because black authors are not represented as much in Core Curriculum studies as white authors is a naive and insensitive notion, for the form and content are what matter in art, not superficial politics. We cannot afford to reject the great works of Western Civilization, because if the fate of our liberal arts education is for our books to be burned like the books burned by the ignorant in Nazi Germany, then our fate is to be ignorant, too.

276,Music Humanities,New phone sectioning to replace current system,16 April 1993,"By Mike Stanton Spectator Staff WriterBeginning next semester, students at Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) will be able to section for limited enrollment classes by using a touch-tone phone to call the University's registration computer. This telephone mechanism will replace the current process of automated sectioning. ""What this means is a radical change,"" University Registrar Joseph Capobianco said. The process will require studentsto enter their Columbia identification number, a special Personal Identification Number, followed by a five-digit number that identifies the specific section the student desires, Assistant Registrar Marguerite Nelson said. ""We'll give the students a worksheet before they leave in May, which will help them organize the information and make the phone call easier,"" Nelson said. ''The computer will let the student know immediately if they have gotten into the section they requested."" The change grew out of the University Senate's decision to changethe academic calendar, starting classes on the Tuesday, rather than the Thursday, following Labor Day. This change went into effect this year for the first time. ""Because the dorms aren'tavailable until the Thursday before Labor Day, itdoesn'tgive us much time to hold automated sectioning and distribute the results before classes start,"" Capobianco said. ""The registrar's office, and the deans of students from the Engineering School and [Columbia] College formed a committee to determine how we make the process better,"" Capobianco added. The committee's original plan called for continuing students to section for their classes in May, but officials were not sure how many places they would need to set aside in the sections for first-year students. ""We had scheduled sectioning for continuing students for this spring, but the registrar's office didn't feel confident enough about keeping spaces open for the incoming students,"" said Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka. ""The ability for students to sit at home and register for classes should represent a significant improvement over the old process of waiting on lines,"" Lehecka said. Sectioning by telephone will take place for the fall semester betweenSept. 3 and 10, and students involved will be assigned an appointment time, before which they may not section. ""Automated Sectioning did have a degree of randomness that we wanted to maintain. The appointments will ensure randomness in the process,"" Nelson said. ""If a student calls before their appointment, the system will shut them out, and not allow them to register until it is their turn."" All Columbia College and SEAS students will receive an abbreviated list of courses for the fall semester before leaving for the summer, Nelson said. ""There are quite a few courses involved, so it probably will make sense to produce an extract of the entire class schedule, so that students can consider theirentire schedule when deciding which limited enrollment sections to apply for,"" Nelson said. The new process, however, will not allow students to choose specific professors for Literature, Art, or Music Humanities courses, Capobianco said. ""We take our direction in those areas from the departments, and the schools involved,"" Capobianco said. The Literature Humanities department decided in March to withhold the names of the instructors assigned to each section, adopting a policy that had been used by the Art and Music Humanities departments since the inception of those courses."
277,Music Humanities,"More good classes, please",13 September 1993,"Columbia College advertises itself each year to prospective students as a small college (the smallest in the Ivy League) that concentrates on the high quality education it provides its students. World renowned professors, a wide variety of courses, and small Core Curriculum classes are central to that claim. This semester, however, with many professors absent and class sizes bulging, some questions must be raised about whether Columbia is truly dedicated to the education of its undergraduate students. The lack of popular professors teaching courses this semester is central to the problems faced by students in selecting classes. Dozens of professors have taken all or part of the 1993-94 year off, conspicuously affecting several departments' ability to offer a wide range of classes. Department chairs neglected to ensure that replacements would be available for those professors on leave. Poor planning is also to blame for the lack of variety in departmental course offerings this semester. The University Course Bulletin lists many general survey classes but too few specialized courses; this problem is exacerbated by the fact that both Barnard College and Columbia College often offer duplicate courses. If the University is to decrease its faculty numbers, it must make certain that classes are not duplicated, that professors whose expertise differs from the present faculty are hired, and that lecture courses offer the same degree of specialization found in seminars. More forethought should also be given to the scheduling of the classes that are offered. While departments attempt to stagger classes, there still remain blocks of time in which too many or too few classes are offered, and professors seem hesitant to teach over lunch or during the evening. Departments must think more about the interests of students taking their classes and the time conflicts that could arise for students of particular fields. Also problematic is the planning observed in the number of classes required both for graduation and for specific majors. In a school that requires students to take four semesters of language courses, it is inappropriate to offer so few that such classes become as oversized and as difficult to get into as they currently are. It is also unfair to experiment with Core sections without informing students beforehand. University adminsitrators are currently debating whether to increase the number of students in Core classes and several experimental enlarged sections were created without the prior knowledge of students or any attempts to gauge their opinions about the new classes. While 60-person music humanities classes may be the future of Columbia College, they were not what the school advertised and may pose a threat to the integrity of the Core. With the appointments of University President George Rupp and Dean of Columbia College Steven Marcus, the University faces many choices and changes. One of these choices is about what kind of school Columbia College wants to be —a large impersonal institution dedicated primarily to research, or a small college dedicated to education, as it claims to be. We want the latter."
278,Music Humanities,Marcus and Bynum discuss future,15 September 1993,"By Ronen M. Glimer Spectator Staff WriterDean of Columbia College Steven Marcus and Dean of the School of General Studies Carolyn Bynum informally discussed the Columbia College's role within the University with approximately 40 students last night in the Hartley Hall Library. Marcus, who also holds the position of vice president for Artsand Sciences, gave a brief historical overview of the University's history and Columbia College's changing role since its inception. He described the Columbia College that once stood in the shadows of the renowned graduate schools and graduate programs, as well as the Columbia College of today that occupies a more prominent position. He added that he hopes the school will occupy an even more respected position in the coming years.Mafcus also detailed the agenda he shares with his associates, University President George Rupp, Bynum, and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Eduardo Macagno, for the upcoming year. Most importantly, Marcus said, is the University's effort to shift Columbia College to the center of the Arts and Sciencesconstruct. ""We are committed to the reforming, reshaping, and above all, improving the undergraduate programs,"" Marcus said. The Arts and Sciences construct consists of Columbia College, the School of the Arts, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of General Studies, and the School of International and Public Affairs. Bynum and Marcus spoke frankly with the students about the need to restructure the college's major programs. They also called for student input in letting the administration know what problems exist. ""It's no secret to say, in general, that we feel very proud of what you experience in the first two years of your undergraduate career —that is your Core Curriculum. We feel that there are some problems with the last two years,"" Bynum said.""We need input from you. We need to know what your concerns are. We really are anxious to know what you're interested in having us do,"" she said. Changes in the major system and the Core Curriculum are also being sought out through present experimental curricula in Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Contemporary Civilization. ""If the Core is not strong enough to withstand experimentation, than it is not strong enough at all,"" Marcus said. Currently, the administration is focusing on three capital projects outside the academic sphere. Included are the creation of a visitors center in Low Library and renovations in both Butler Library and Ferris Booth Hall. Marcus and Bynum also cited the need for more seminars, an honors program, and the addition of senior theses to the requirements of certain majors.Most of these topics will be handled by the Committee on Undergraduate Education. Another issue that was of concern to students who attended last night's session was the quality of academic advising in the College. ""This is a big place, an impersonal place. Lots of things are wrong. With a change of a new major system will arise a change in academic advising,"" Bynum said. Students in attendance left with a positive impression of their new deans. ""I really think they seem to be going in a pretty encouraging direction,"" said Chris Heller, CC '96. ""I really hope they follow through with what they said because it will help make Columbia a much more pleasant place,"" she said. Professor of Anthropology Katherine Newman, who serves as Hartley-Wallach's faculty-in-resi-dence, hosted the event.Katherine Newman and Steven Marcus."
279,Music Humanities,"Core Curriculum prize awarded to Mirollo, Smit",15 September 1993,"By Mary E. Pflum Associate Features EditorProfessors James Mirollo and J.W. Smit were honored as the recipients of the First Annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum, yesterday in the President's Room of the Faculty House. Smit, who teaches Music Humanities this semester, and has taught Contemporary Civilization in previous years, is also the Queen Wilhelmina professor of German history. Mirollo teaches Literature Humanities and holds the Parr professorship of English and comparative literature.The recognition ceremony was long overdue, according to University Professor Emeritus William deßary, the reception's master of ceremonies. ""You can have great book awards. You can have great teacher awards. Those awards are generally reserved for stars. But someone has to provide leadership for the team. And that's what we're trying to recognize today,"" deßary said. ""It's always a struggle to keep the Core going. The Core only goes on if there are people willing to work at it,""he added. In their acceptance speeches, bothSmit and Mirollo expressed hope that the Core will continue to grow and change in the years to come without losing its unique, personal flavor. ""I feel encouraged that this is an annual award, because that means there's going to be a Core in years to come. The Core will evolve over the years. But there are some things that should remain the same,"" Mirollo said. Mirollo expressed concern that drastic changes in the Core Curriculum's format, most notably an increase in class size, might detract from the goals of the Core Curriculum. Expressing worries about this semester's larger, experimental sections of music humanities courses, Smit said radical change in the Core Curriculum in the form of growing class sizes is cause for alarm. ""There is a tremendous differ-ence between lecturing and having good class discussions. The most important part of [Contemporary Civilization] is that it forces selfcriticism. I think it would destroy not only the CC course, but the Core, to increase class size,"" he said. ""If the Core is made into a series of lectures, it will kill the Core and [Columbia] College will have lost its soul,"" Smit concluded. Mirollo served as dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1970 to 1971. He also chaired the English department from 1971 to 1973.

280,Music Humanities,Two Music Hum. sections expanded,16 September 1993,"By Mary E. Pflum Associate Features EditorIn an effort to determine whether the focus and character of the Columbia College Core Curriculum can be maintained in the framework of larger classes, student enrollment in two fall semester sections of Music Humanities has been expanded. According to Associate Professor Elaine Sisman, chair of the Music Humanities Department, two sectionsof Music Humanities, whichmeet at 11 a.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays, have been combined into one section with a limited enrollment of 52 students. Sisman said that another Monday/Wednesday section of the course, which she teaches, has been expanded to allow 35 students in it. Core courses are traditionally limited to a maximum of 25 students, Sisman said. According to Sisman, the experimental expansion of the sections was the result of recommendationssubmitted last year by a Strategic Planning Subcommittee on General and Special Education, chaired by Columbia College Dean Steven Marcus. ""The committee talked to the chairmen of all the Core classes and made various recommendations.They suggested that we experiment with class size,"" she said. ""The expansion has nothing to do with our staff or the size of our department. It has to do with the administration's thoughts of expanding the college in years to come,"" Sisman added. If the University pursues projected plans to expand Columbia College's undergraduate population, currently at approximately 3,200 students, in years to come, Sisman said, experimentation with Core Curriculum class size is a necessity. ""Our experiment is to see if we can maintain the Core format with more students. We just want to see if it can work,"" Sisman said. In an interview last week, Marcus said that he is not yet certain if this experiment will be tried in other Core courses, but that the other Humanities programs are being studied to see if possible changes could be implemented. ""We certainly want Humanities to undergo a very careful review,"" Marcus said. Several advocates of the traditionally small Core classes, however, worry thatenlarged enrollments in Music Humanities and other Core courses will ultimately destroy the intimate atmosphere and discussion opportunities that make the classes unique. According to James Mirollo, Parr professor of English and comparative literature and former chair of the Literature Humanities department, the small size of Core classes is one of Columbia's chief assets. ""The Core evolves. It will evolve. But there are some things that make it what it is—one being small class size. The Core identifies us and weshould try to maintain it in the way we have done,"" Mirollo said. ""You shouldn't fix what ain't broke. If we begin to look like everybody else (with large lecture classes), there's no reason left to come to Columbia,"" he added. Richard Billows, chair of the Contemporary Civilization program, said that a growing undergraduate student population should not necessitate ""oversized"" Core Curriculum classes. ""The whole point of these Core courses is for the students to discuss and interact with each other and the instructor. With a larger section, you're talking about a very different enterprise—a lecture class,"" Billows said. ""If the University continues to increase, one goal would be to have a larger faculty or to integrate the teaching of the Core into the graduate student program,"" he added. Despite faculty complaints regarding the enlargement of the Music Humanities sections, Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis insisted that there is no cause for worry. ""Faculty members experiment all the time with courses. This is nothing new. All we're doing is seeing if the larger sections will work academically and pedagogically. We'll hear from students. We'll hear from faculty members. And we'll carry on from there,"" she said. Students enrolled in the enlarged courses are already collecting ideas to submit to Col umbia College deans when course evaluations are distributed at the end of the semester. Simon Banyai, CC '96, a member of the 35-student Humanities section, said he does not like large classes in principal. ""I'm not in favor of larger courses.I went to a private high school with 15 or 16 students in each class. I think larger classes give the opportunity fpr too many people to hide,"" he said. Although Nicholas Chremos, CC '96, said that he thinks Sisman is doing a ""pretty good"" job handling her class of 35 students, he admitted that he worries about continual expansion of the size of Core classes. ""I think it's all a little silly. If one pays so much money to go here, one expects smaller courses. Essentially, the entire point of the Core ceases to exist with larger classes,"" Chremos said. ""One reason I came here was for smaller courses. Otherwise, I would have gone to the University of Texas —and it's a lot cheaper to go there,"" he said.Three neighborhood children give Facilities Management a hand by using their bubble solution to give the lion heads outside Butler Library a thorough cleaning."
281,Music Humanities,SPECTRUM Don't ignore essence of the Core,27 September 1993,"Don't ignore essence of the CoreBy Dr. John D. RosenbergA bland headline in the Sept. 16 Spectator, ""Two music humanities sections expanded,"" portends bad news for Columbia College. At the heart of Columbia College's intellectual distinction is the ongoing experiment we know as the Core. Invoking that same spirit of innovation, the Strategic Planning Subcommittee on General Education recently recommended that we ""experiment"" with the size of Humanities sections—an experiment to be tried in one direction only: greater numbers. Spectator reports that Music Humanities has complied with the recommendation by establishing one section with a ""limited enrollment of 52 students,"" and another limited to 35. Because of the projected increase in the population of the College, the Chair of Music Humanities, Professor Elaine Sisman, seconding the subcommittee's report, argues that""experimenting with Core Curriculum class size is a necessity. Our experiment is to see if we can maintain the Core format with more students."" The answer, for anyone who has ever taken or taught Contemporary Civilization or Humanities, is that you cannot. Humanities sections ""limited"" to 52 students, or to 35 or 350 will inevitably negate, by virtue of their size, the intense, intimate engagement of teacher and student with the book in hand, the classroom dialogue that constitutes the course. ""Faculty members experiment all the time with courses. This is nothing new,"" says Kathryn Yatrakis, a strong supporter of the Core. What Yatrakis says is perfectly true —and perfectly beside the point. For the subcommittee's so-called ""experiment"" is not an experiment at all, if by the term one means a controlled procedure designed to ascertain a new fact or confirm an old one. Rather it is a verbal ploy designed to mask, in hard financial times, the collection of tuition dollars from more students, and the paying out of dollars to fewer faculty. If the administration or the Strategic Planning Subcommittee were more candid, competing claims —the need to increase revenue vs. the desirability of smaller classes —might be intelligently debated and honestly reconciled. But the present ""experi-ment"" is more like shooting a horse in the head to see if it will run faster on fewer oats. It won't, though the cost of provisioning the creature willundoubtedly go down. Some students in the swollen sections will have excellent lecturers and will like the experiment; some will have less gifted lecturers and will not. But the results will in any case be meaningless. For not a single participant in the experiment will in truth have experienced Humanities, though the course will still be so-designated in the Columbia College Bulletin. For a time Columbia College will continue to draw students from all over the nation because of the fame of the Core and our success in promoting it. For a time, alumni will still contribute to the college in the mistaken bel ief that they are perpetuating what they most valued in their four years here. But word will get out, reputation and cheapened reality will pull too far apart, and something unique and irreplaceable will have vanished from the culture of Columbia College. Perhaps, I am too apocalyptic inmy fears, too unwilling to swallow public relations gimmickry in the interests of a larger and, maybe, a less financially pinched Columbia.But my fears are based on almost 40 years of close connection to the Core, first as a student sitting in the classrooms of its founders —Mark Van Doren, Moses Hadas, Lionel Trilling—then as Chairman of Humanities when it threatened to disintegrate under the centrifugal forces unleashed in 1968, and now as the Literature Humanities instructor with perhaps the longest continuing association with the course. Over time, and in consequence of witnessing and encouraging much au//?enncexperimentation, I have come to appreciate the irreducible elements that have enabled Humanities to evolve and adapt while remaining its essential self. These irreducible elements are a common reading list and common final exam for all sections; small classes that encourage discussion, with a maximum of 22-25 students, most of them in their first year; a teaching staff that meets regularly and with full autonomy debates and decides each year's syllabus. Any one of these three elements, if subverted, will render the other two ineffectual. Fifty independent sections of 22-25 students each, with each section reading its own thing,cannot possibly constitute the communal enterprise called Freshman Humanities. Thirty sections of 50 students each cannot possibly experience Humanities, any more than you can silence all the marvelous talk in th Q Symposium and still have a Platonic dialogue. I return to the collapsing of two sections of Music Humanities into one with a""limited enrollment"" of 52, a phrase that puts me in mind of a passage from Thucydides known to generations of Humanities students. Thucydides describes the corruption of language under thestress of war: terrible actions— murder, betrayal of one's family to the state—come to be called courageous or patriotic. Orwell called such mind-warping euphemisms ""Newspeak,"" and now we find a less lethal, laundered specimen cited 'mSpectator. I prefer to call the doubling of class-size exactly what it is, so we can debate it for what it is: a wise orfoolish choice among many hard choices in tight financial times. Let us not, except as a sick joke, call it ""an experiment in format."" I have saved the worst for last. ""It is not yet certain,"" Spectator reports in its most alarming sentence, ""if thisexperiment will be tried in other Core courses..."" 1 suggest that, before the experimentbecomesacertainty, the administration consult with each of the respective teaching staffs and with the Committees on the Core and on Instruction. And in fairness to our alumni, as well as in prudent regard for their future contributions, the administration might also solicit their response to the doubling up of classes in Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Are we indeed so destitute that we are reduced to eating the Core?"
282,Music Humanities,"Marcus, Bynum discuss possible Core changes",13 October 1993,"By Brad Meacham Contributing WriterDean of Columbia College Steven Marcus and Dean of the School of General Studies Caroline Bynum spoke about ways to retain the small size of Core Curriculum courses with increasingly scarce resources with about 20 students lastnight in Professor Robert Hymes' apartment in East Campus. Early in the evening, Mark Robilotti, CC '94, asked what future changes are in store for the Core Curriculum. Marcus said the traditionally limited size of Core Curriculum classes is under consideration. ""I find nothing offensive with experimenting with a larger section provided that it features an extremely good instructor. Twenty-one [students] need not be the magic number,"" Marcus said. Currently, there are two sections of Music Humanities which exceed the traditional limit of 25-30 students, one of which includes approximately 65 students.Marcus said that if Columbia is currently faced with ""50 percent crackerjack teachers and 50 percent that we'd rather not talk about"" something must be done to eliminate poor teaching. When Marcus asked those who attended if they agreed with his assessment, no one responded. ""Since there are no takers, I realize there is a problem,"" he said.""We want small courses and a large number of good teachers. But the two don't necessarily go together."" Bynum said the primary reason that the Core Curriculum may be altered is the lack of monetary resources. ""When we focus on Core classes, the upper level classes are a problem,"" she said. ""There are ways to be more efficient with the faculty available so that those resources can be refocused."" ""[Refocusing] is something that hasn't been thought about creatively here,' she said. ""A, we're going to have to have larger classes. And B, we need to find out ways to make those better,"" Bynum said. In discussing possible changes, Marcus also cited the several ""experimental"" sections of Contemporary Civilization which take a new, thematic approach to the same gen-eral material covered by the rest of the course sections. Marcus said instead of dealing with the material in a strictly chronological manner, these alternative sections deal with several broad themes and look at the material within the context of those themes, hopefully helping the course live up to its title as contemporary. Each ""experimental"" section will be evaluated by students and faculty and any changes to the overall Contemporary Civilization program will be decided on sometime next year, Marcus said. Marcus said the Cultures and Issues requirement also needs to be reformed because it currently includes a wide selection of courses from various departments. He spoke of a need to ""redefine the meaning"" of the requirement and establish courses which fit into a discrete series of classes rather than the current ""hodgepodge,"" as well as new Cultures courses which address growing areas such as PanAfrican studies. Another program which will receive attention will be the Logic and Rhetoric course, which Marcus characterized as widely unliked. ""It doesn't bother me that people don't like it, but it is a problem that there seems to be so little retentioneffect,"" he said. As a professor, Marcus noted that students often forgot what they had learned in Logic and Rhetoric by their senior year. What needs to be determined is whether that situation indicates a problem with the course itself or with the amount of writing required elsewhere in Columbia College, he said. Pippa Murray, CC '96, asked whether the practice of witholding a list of instructors' names for Literature Humanities courses, begun this semester, would continue. Marcus said that when he was an undergraduate at Columbia, students also signed up for anonymous sections of the course, but added he was""on the fence"" on the issue. Jay Berman, CC '94, said he is concerned that first-year students may take as many as three Core Curriculum courses during their first semester without knowing the names of their instructors. ""I'm trying to push you off [the fence],"" Berman said. Marcus said one reform may include developing a teacher training center like the Business School uses to insure that all teachers are as good as they need to be. ""If the Core is strong, it's strong enough to be experimented with,"" Marcus said."
283,Music Humanities,CUE begins work revising majors,28 October 1993,"By Nathaniel Daw Spectator Staff WriterMarking a University-wide effort to focus on Columbia's undergraduate divisions, the newly formed Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE) met for the first time last week. Atthe meeting, committee members worked out logistical details and discussed the scope of their upcoming work, according to Associate Vice President for Arts and Sciences and Dean of the School ofGeneral Studies Carolyn Walker Bynum. Bynum co-chairs the committee with Vice President for Arts and Sciences and Dean of Col umbia College Steven Marcus. The committee, which grew out of recommendations from the Strategic Planning Commission's task force on education, will look at issues that affect all four of the University's undergraduate divisions—Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the School of Engineering and AppliedScience, and Barnard College—such as whether the schools are duplicating each others' efforts in areas such as language classes. Committee members are working without a deadline, according to Marcus. ""We're not making any decision. We're beginning by exploring,"" Marcus said. Committee members will investigate ways to improve departmental majors and coordinate the four undergraduate divisions. The committee members will also consider changes tothe Core Curriculum and examine ways to gather the resources needed to support whatever programs the committee ultimately proposes to the Committee on Instruction. Following up on questions raised last year by the Strategic Planning Commission about whether the last two years of a Columbia College education measure up to the first two, one CUE subcommittee will look at improving the school's majors. The subcommittee includes representatives from seven departments that are currently revising their curricula. ""The idea is to get seven departments which are working on their majors to do it together,"" Bynumsaid. At a series of public discussions with students held by Marcus and Bynum, students have repeatedly expressed concerns that the focus on majors and the recent experiments with the Core Curriculum's format, such as enlarged Music Humanities sections, will undermine the mission of the Core. Allyson Baker, CC '95, Columbia College's studentrepresentative to CUE, said she intends to remind the committee's professors and administrators of these concerns. ""When [Core Curriculum sections] are 65 people, it doesn't affect administrators, it doesn't affect professors as much as it affects students,"" Baker said. Bynum said improvements in the specific majors need not come at the expense of the general education embodied by the Core Curriculum, because the group hopes to better integrate those two aspects of Columbia education. One possible way of doing this, Bynum said, is tointroduce degree-specific classes during students' first year, or a Core Curriculum class during students' senior year. ""It's only if one takes a rather simpleminded notion that the Core is the first two years and the degree is the last two years that one would see them in any kind of conflict,"" said Bynum. Marcus said that Core Curriculum classes will not necessarily lose resources because of the improvements in the departmental majors. ""There are many ways of improving things without adding resources,"" Marcus said. Committee members will also consider how to improve instructors' teaching skills, perhaps by implementing a center for teachers to learn teaching techniques. A similar program at the Columbia Business School has proven ""very successful,"" Marcus said. ""When I was teaching, I would have enjoyed having a resource like this available,"" said Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis, a member of CUE."
284,Music Humanities,Alums mixed in regard to proposed Core changes,11 November 1993,"By Leron Kornreich Spectator Staff WriterIn response to this semester's enlargement of two sections of Music Humanities, Columbia College alumni have expressed mixed feelings about the prospect of larger Core Curriculum class sizes. ""I know a good portion of the alumni who revere the Core would fear the class size would be getting too large,"" Gerald Sherwin, CC '55, said. Core Curriculum classes typically contain a maximum of 24 students. There is currently one experimental Music Hum section containing 39 students, despite a recommended limit of 35. In addition, Chair of Music Humanities Elaine Sisman is currently teaching a Music Hum section of about 60 students. Almost all of the Music Hum sections have more people enrolled than the prescribed limit, according to University Registrar Joseph Capobianco. Dean of Columbia College Steven Marcus said the experimentation with class size in Music Hum occurred spontaneously, with ""no bad thoughts in mind."" In describing the Core Curriculum, the 1993-94 Columbia University Bulletin boasts that ""as justly celebrated as the content of these courses are, the real secret of theirsuccess lies in the give and take of the small class experience."" ""I think that the Core Curriculum is one of the things that Columbia prides itself on,"" said Rita Pietropinto, CC '93, a first-year student in the School of the Arts. ""It gives students the opportunity to sit down with a professor and really think... otherwise it seems to be justanother introductory class."" Alumni have differing opinions on how essential class size is to maintaining the purported aims of the Core. ""There is a greater tendency for dialogue between yourself, the other students, and the professor [when the class size is small],"" Sherwin said. ""I do think something is 105t...in any course you take if the class gets to be a certain size."" ""I think they are going in root to one of the things that makes Columbia great and destroying it,"" Arthur S. Graham, Jr., CC '42, said. Other alumni assert that larger classes will not damage the effec-tiveness of the Core. ""It does not really matter particularly,"" Franklin G. Bishop, CC '42, said. He explained that when he was enrolled in Columbia College, he took a lecture class equivalent to Music Hum to fulfill his requirement. In addition, Bishop completed his second semester of Contemporary Civilization (CC) by taking an exam on the course content, rather than attending classes in a standard setting. In the 19405, students had the option of passing CC through independent study. Bishop took the first half of CC in a standard classroom setting and took the final examination for credit for the second semester. ""I was interested in getting to the advanced courses as early as possible,"" he said. Bishop said he is not worried that there will be a lack of participation in discussion if the class size isexpanded. ""I do not mind talking a lot even if there are 40 people in a class, or if there are 20,"" Bishop said. ""After all, we had over 30 people in our high school classes, so I do not see anything wrong."" Many alumni said they do not fully understand the reasons for expanding the Core Curriculum class sizes. ""I am not quite sure what everyone is hoping to achieve by this test of larger classes for the Core Curriculum,"" Sherwin said. Daniel Dauber, CC '92, said he thought the expansion in size might enhance the learning experience. ""If it means that students will have a chance to have better quality professors then perhaps it might be beneficial —unless they are expanding the classes to save money,"" Dauber said. Amid speculation thatan attempt to save money may be the primary motivation in a possible decision to expand class sizes, some alumnisaid they were not sure how justified such a reason would be. ""It would not seem to save too much money,"" said Kevin Burke, CC '9l, said. Pietropinto acknowledged that larger classes may provide more students with a chance to learn with a full-time professor, but feels that the disadvantages outweigh potential benefits. ""I think that it is a shame that some students do not get full-time professors when they take the Core and they do get stuck with graduate students... but it is ruining the spirit of the Core Curriculum [to increase class size],"" Pietropinto said. ""You really do not have [small classes] again until you are a junior or senior."" Alumni generally said they find it hard to criticize or commend the rumors because not enough details are known. ""It is very important to take into account what students feel,"" Sherwin said.Over 400 Jewish students participate in the Weekly Night Learning Program. Students are paired with other students to learn about issues in Judaism.

285,Music Humanities,Students prepare Core petition for Marcus,24 November 1993,"By Nathaniel Daw Spectator Staff WriterIn order to protest several experimental Music Humanities sections, a Columbia College student will present Dean of Columbia College Steven Marcus with a petition tomorrow signed by over 600 students. Rebecca Stanton, CC '94, said she began circulating the petition approximately six weeks ago in one of her classes. Working with her friends, she has since solicited signatures from students in Ferris Booth Hall and in two University dormitories. The petition says students are ""shocked and dismayed"" by two experimental Music Humanities sections thatexceed the traditional class size of approximately 25 students. ""We implore your administration todiscontinue this experiment as soon as possible, and above all not to extend it to other Core Curriculum classes,"" the petition continues. The experimental Music Humanities sections, one of which exceeds 65 students, are two of several Core Curriculum experiments introduced this semester. In addition to the changes in the Music Humanities, six Contemporary Civilization sections are using revised syllabi this year that are organized thematically rather than chronologically. Stanton said her petition is specifically aimed at the Music Humanities courses, not the changes in Contemporary Civilization. ""[The Music Humanities experiment] has the singular advantage of saving money. It's an extraordinarycase because it seems to directly contradict what has been said about the purpose of the Core in the past,"" Stanton said. ""The purpose of the Core is exactly what it says in the Bulletin: that you get to discuss things and actively think about them yourself. We pay $24,000 a year for that privilege, so there just isn't any excuse,"" Stanton said. Marcus said he could not discuss the details of the petition because he has not yet read it, but he said he will take the petition into account when evaluating the experiment at the end of the semester. ""I'm glad that they feel strongly. It's good to know that they care. It's very important that they do,"" Marcus said. He has repeatedly supported the experiments in the past, saying that Music Humanities classes do notinvolve as much class discussion as other classes within the Core. In an interview last month, however, he said that any further experiments with the Core Curriculum will not be implemented without extensive planning. ""The Music Hum classes were done spontaneously with no bad thoughts in mind,"" Marcus said. ""Further experiments will not take place in that way. We want to be thorough and careful about it —after all, it's our college."" Students who signed the petition said they were especially worried that the experiments will lead to enlarged class sizes in Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, two classes which are designed for discussions. ""I think if classes are bigger it's definitely going to detract from the Core. I don't think there's any way that everyone would be able to participate, either speaking or listen-ing,"" Kimberly Chang, CC '95, said. Small class sizes are what make Core Curriculum classes special, according to many of the students who signed the petition. ""You can go read books for any other lecture class and go listen to a professor speak,"" Emily Hu, CC '95, said. Stanton said she had collected 652 signatures by Monday, although she expects to obtain more from petitions posted in four residence halls. Although she has already completed her Core Curriculum requirements, Stanton said she circulated the petition to help maintain the quality of education for future students. But she admits her motives are not completely selfless. ""I don't want my diploma to be devalued after I graduate,"" Stanton said. ""I don't want people to think 'lt's basically Florida State with a tripled price tag.' """
286,Music Humanities,SPECTRUM A phallus in 208 Hamilton Hall,2 December 1993,"A phallus in 208 Hamilton HallI was walking by Take Back the Night's giant severed penis on the steps yesterday, and I thought to myself, ""You know, Andrew, I real-Andrew JorgensenShadow Boxingize that this giant severed penis is designed to make me question America's priorities in terms of ignoring the continuing rape of women to focus on the emasculation of John Bobbitt, and this giant severed penis certainly has made me question these priorities, but, really, when I look at this giant severed penis, all I can truly think about is Dean Steven Marcus."" T:e aptness of this analogy will become apparent as I relate the details of Dean Marcus's reception of Rebecca Stanton's petition expressing concern over the Music Hum section expansion experiment and what it suggests about the future of the core. Rebecca has so far collected 812 signatures and rightly believes that this surge of student dissatisfaction should be recognized. Rebecca had been trying to make an appointment with Marcus for weeks, speaking mostly to a ""pleasant young gentleman"" (p.y.g.) who works in the dean's office. The p.y.g. had given her a list of times during which an appointment might be made and then called her back to tell her that list of times wasn't good for Marcus. The p. y. g. suggested that Rebecca come to Marcus' s Wednesday office hour, but Rebecca told him that she had a time conflict forthat hour. The p. y. g. responded, ""It might be possible to set up a brief meeting, but Dean Marcus prefers to deal with students only during his office hour."" She finally scheduled a meeting for the next week's office hour. Last Tuesday, the day before the scheduled meeting, the p. y. g. called Rebecca to tell her that Dean Marcus was ill and had canceled his office hour for that week, although he waskeeping his non-student related appointments. Rebecca explained that it was a matter of some urgency, as she would like to turn in the petition before the Spectator printed its last issue. To this end, the p. y. g. gave hera 15 minute appointmentat 10:30 the next day. The p. y. g. also suggested that she bring along a fewother students, to convince Marcus that she was not alone in her endeavor. Heeding this advice, she took her friend Doug. She had considered bringing me along, but realized that Marcus would either have no clue as to who I am, or recognize me as a loose cannon rabble rouser who might, without hesitation, compare him to a giant severed penis. So Doug and Rebecca showed up forthe appointment, were ushered into Marcus's office, and were greeted by Marcus, who had not heard theAndrew Jorgensen, CC'94, has completed his Shadow Boxing marathon.

287,Music Humanities,Core petitioners await dean's response,2 December 1993,"By Ruth Halikman Spectator Staff WriterDean of Columbia College Steven Marcus has yet to respond to a petition signed by students concerned about the size of experimental Music Humanities sections. Rebecca Stanton, CC '94, drafted and circulated the petition, which states that students are ""shocked and dismayed"" by two experimental Music Hum sections that significantly increase the traditional Core class size, which is 25 students. Stanton presented the petition, which was signed by 783 students, to Marcus last Wednesday. Since then she has gathered 29 more signatures. Marcus said he was impressed by the amount of devotion students at Columbia College show toward maintaining the Core Curriculum. ""I thought it was very thoughtful, and I took it very seriously: I think it's a marvelous thing that students care,"" he said. Stanton, however, said she is notconvinced of Marcus' commitment to the situation. ""He said that at some point perhaps he would call me into discuss it, but I got the impression that he was just pretending to be interested."" Stanton said. She added that the volume of student support for the petition should tell Marcus that he needs to take action. ""I'll be disappointed if nothing happens, if he thinks the students' opinion doesn't really matter,"" she said. ""Since 800 people signed the petition, they should not even think about continuing the Music Hum experiment."" Marcus said the primary motivation for the Music Hum experiment was to reduce the number of classes taught by graduate students, because he had received complaints about the quality of Core class instruction. ""We don't know what the ideal size for any class is,"" he said. ""We thought maybe Music Hum would be interesting to experiment with because less discussion of an argu-mentative kind takes place there."" Stanton said she does not find this argument convincing. ""I applaud [the experiment] as an attempt to give everyone better teachers, but obviously the students would rather have the smal 1 classes. So apparently the people in those classes don't agree with the 'bigger classes, better teachers' logic,"" she said. ""There's nothing that prevents grad students from being good teachers,"" she added. Marcus also said the fate of the experiment depends on the results of an evaluation to be conducted by Elaine Sisman, who chairs the Music Humanities department, at the end of this semester. ""We have to evaluate it ... It's just a one semester experiment to begin with,"" he said. ""If the response is favorable, we plan to expand the experimental sections next year. The experiment will be carefully controlled and thought out beforehand.""University Provost Jonathan Cole spoke to a student yesterday afternoon in a forum entitled ""Conversations with Cole,"" an effort by the administration to increase communication with students."
288,Music Humanities,Another view of the CU deficit,24 January 1994,"By ISRAEL KOCHINDean Steven Marcus has been looking for ways to save money and improve the quality of instruction at Columbia College. A recent expreiment wasthe expansion of two sections of Music Humanities. Marcus has explained that, if successful, the experiment could save money and provide for better instruction by exposing more students to a single outstanding lecturer. I have an even better solution. Let the Phonemail lady do the teaching. The benefits would be enormous. Because the ROLM phone system is completely automated, students could listen to lectures at their convenience. There would not need to be a cap on student enrollment. Columbia could be even more commercialized than it is already. (""Tired of your menial job? Attend Columbia University's School of General Phone Studies. Fool all your friends and future employers into thinking you are Ivy material; just bucks, no brains, required."") ""For the first lecture, push one ..."" Students could listen to lectures repeatedly or out of sequence. No more need to juggle a schedule soyou can attend the three credit seminar on Influence of Bushman Architecture on Panda Bear Sexuality in 13th century Palestine, which fulfills the extended core requirement. ""If the opera you have just heard is Mozart, push one ..."" Midterms and quizzes would have to be multiple choice for automated grading. The additional benefit of this is that grades would be instantly available (No nervous breakdowns while waiting for that small, thin envelope that decides your future as either a medical doctor in suburbia, or used magazine merchant in front of the University Food Market.The savings generated by this program could be used by Columbia to open a whole new office of makework administrators (or for the politically correct ""assistant administrative Post-it processors""). Maybe the funds could be used for the renovation of Butler Library or dormitiries that might even have working heating systems and running water. (Who am I kidding?

Whether or not Dean Marcus' first seven months on the job have been successful or not is, in this regard, immaterial.

This is not to say that Marcus' tenure has been altogether successful: by his own admission, it has not. Many of his actions and comments have deserved thoughtful, informed criticism. Unfortunately, this is precisely what they have not received. What is so baffling about the attacks on Marcus is that they are almost entirely baseless. The chorus of his detractors say Marcus will destroy the Core, but can one person pointto a specific proposal of Marcus' that will truly undermine the Core Curriculum? Putting 60 people in a single Music Humanities section was certainly misguided, but Marcus maintained from the beginning that it was a one-semester experiment that would never be applied to Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization. Marcus has said that the Core is being examined and changes are being considered. All across campus, people throw up their arms in disgust and say Marcus is trying to destroywhat is uniquely great about the Columbia education. Since I have been a student here, however, I have heard one horror story after another from students about their experiences with the Core Curriculum: bad teachers, inflexible syllabi, etc. And now, when Marcus says he wants to improve the Core, eyes widen and jaws fall to the floor as if he suggested razing the Parthenon. For all the talk about the great progressive tradition at Columbia, the campus' response to Marcus has shown that this campus is more conservative and averse to change than Oral Roberts' Moral Majority. And so these reactionaries have gleefully begun to number the days until Marcus is forced back into the classroom. Indeed, if student sentiment against the dean does not soften, these people may get their wish. Inevitably, student dissatisfaction will evolve into angry phone calls from alumni. Then, the death knell may indeed ring for Dean Marcus. This would be unfortunate, because over his long career at Columbia, Marcus has shown the capacity for innovative solutions to difficult problems, and a genuine concern for the quality of the Columbia education. His work with the Marcus Commission in particular, is still mentioned by administrators as one of the most important contributions any individual has made to this campus in the past 20 years, and set a standard for strategic planning that has not been approached in the 15 years since the commission's report was filed. Marcus has shown ability in the past, and in the long run, it would be a shame for students to lose his talents from the administration. An early departure is avoidable, but it requires a drastic change in the dean's priorities. The most profound error Marcus has made thus far has been his failure to meet with students on a regular basis. It was predictable given Marcus' dual responsibilities as dean and vice president. The merg-ing of the two positions has been tricky and Marcus said in an interview the other day that the most difficult part of his work to date has been learning to delegate responsibilities so that he could have the time to meet with students. As it stands, the only regular contact Marcus has with students are his evening office hours, but this is not sufficient, and he knows it. It's not enough to allow students to come to you. You must make the effort to go to them. Marcus said that he regrets not having enough time to go to bas-ketball games, and eat lunch with students in Ferris Booth, but the demands of his work, he says, make this impossible. What Marcus needs to learn, however, is that meeting with students is by no means something he should do only when he can find the time. It is perhaps the single most important and constructive responsibility of the dean. Engaging in dialogue with students would give depth to his proposals, and soften resistance to his plans for the college. Meeting with students would be an invaluable investment for the dean, and one that he can and must make in the coming months. In the end, his work load would be lessened because the students, once they are familiar with him and his ideas, would be less intractable and hostile. To make Marcus' tenure as dean successful will require some effort by students as well. We must be willing to listen carefully to what is being said, think before we criticize, and when we do, make certain that our goal in doing so is the improvement of our college. It may seem unsavory to some, but who could argue that it is not worth trying?Danny Franklin, CC '94, is a lame duck Spectator News Editor."
290,Music Humanities,USCC calls for a more diverse CORE,2 March 1994,"By MONICA MEHTA Spectator Staff WriterDiscussing the idea that Columbia College's core curriculum excludes non-Western cultures in its reading assignments, a panel ofcampus student leaders addressed about 35 students last night in Ferris Booth Hall (FBH) at a forum sponsored by the United Students of Color Council and the Whitney M. Young Jr. Race and Religious Relations Program. The forum, entitled ""The Core: Campus Leaders Debate Conflicting Perceptions of the Core Curriculum,"" and mediated by USCC Vice Chair Bryonn Bain, CC '95, was held to address the growing concern among students and faculty at Columbia College over the absence of non-European authors, artists, and composers in the four classes comprising the the core curriculum: Contemporary Civilizations, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. Columbia College Student Council (CCSC) President Imara Jones, CC '94, and Dan Morenoff, CC '96, editor of the Opinions secdon ofThe Federalist Paper newspaper, said that the core curriculum's readings should not be drastically altered. Favoring the inclusion of readings from non-Western cultures in the core curriculum, Black Students' Organization (BSO) President Marie Louis, CC '94, Treasurer ofUSCC Omari West, CC'95, and Whitney M. Young Jr. Program Student Coordinator Udit Kondal, CC '94 advocated a change in the curriculum. Former President of the College Democrats Allyson Baker, CC '95, favored a re-examination of the way in which the core is taught, and inclusion of die works of women and texts from other cultures into the curriculum. Panel members who favored reform of the core readings said the curriculum currently centers around Western ideas, and because they do not learn about the literary, artiste, and political traditions of other cultures, students are receiving a limited education. ""The core places the ideas of European thinkers at its center,"" Louis said. ""Everyone else is putin the periphery, as if they had no role in shaping today's society."" Members who disagreed with drastically altering the core's readings said the Western tradition should remain the focus of the core classes because Columbia is an institution which is part of Western culture. Opponents' of the change also emphasized that the core was created to spark critical analysis, not to promote all the ideas in thereadings. ""The core hopes to provide students with an understanding of the dominant Western culture in our society, but we are not attempting to enshrine these authors,"" Morenoff said. Morenoff also said he believed that the core classes should emphasize ideas expressed in the works, rather than their origin. ""The core is not history class,"" Morenoff said. ""We study these people because of their ideas, and ideas have no race."" Louis disagreed, arguing that the core ignores the contributions non-Western thinkers have made to Western thought. ""Why is it that all the people acknowledged to have great ideas in the core come from only one subgroup?"" Louis said. ""The limited foundation the core has attempted to give us is based on a falsification of the facts of history."" Baker and Kondal also disagreed with Morenoff, emphasizing the importance of the origin of ideas. ""I don't think you can understand these great ideas unless you understand their origins and their context,"" Baker said. ""The core curriculum implies that a lot of thought that's worthy of attention started with ancient Greece, and that's Eurocentric,"" Kondal said. ""Many of their ideas were borrowed, if not stolen, from Africa and Asia."" West said the core readings are largely outdated, and limit students' access to new ideas. ""Are we as college students supposed to be constrained to what people in the past think?"" West said. Jones said understanding history was important in understanding the problems in the present. ""You can't understand the present without understanding the past,"" Jones said. ""Ifwe're going to change a patriarchal society, we have to understand patriarchy and the only way we can do that is to study patriarchs."" Other issues brought up in the forum dealt with the absence of works written by and about women and people of different origins in the core classes. BSO Political Chair Sharod Baker, CC '95, thought the forum was productive and informative. ""This made Columbia students look intelligent for once,"" Sharod Baker said. ""In particular, Marie Louis and Imara Jones were very well-versed."" Bain said the forum was only the beginning of the USCC campaign to diversify the core readings, and said a committee will be established to address this issue specifically in the near future."
291,Music Humanities,"Dean says Music Hum test failed Marcus, Rupp participate in town meeting with students",4 March 1994,"Marcus, Rupp participate in town meeting with studentsBy ROLANDO F. PUJOL Spectator Staff WriterAt the first undergraduate town hall meeting of 1994, Dean of Columbia College and Vice President for Arts and Sciences Steven Marcus conceded that controversial experimentation with selected Core Curriculum classes has been a failure because ""students felt they were not learning."" The town meeting was organized by the Office of the President and the Leaders' Inter-Organiza-tional Network (LION), and was attended by over 30 students, who addressed their concerns to Marcus, University President George Rupp, and other University officials. While stressing that different experiments with the Core curriculum will be conducted in future years, Marcus, citing both student and faculty dissatisfaction, said this year's experiment, which involved doubling the class size of certain Music Humanities sections, ""will not be repeated."" ""No educational institution can remain stale. The nature of knowledge forbids it,"" Marcus said, explaining that future experimentation with the Core will be continued in courses where administrators determine that discussions are not central to the nature of thecourse, such as Art and Music Humanities. Rupp said the administration experiments with the Core to explore the possibility that the quality of certain courses that are not dis-cussion-based can be improved by having a superior professor teach a larger number of students. ""It was an experiment, and the intention.underlying it was appropriate,"" Rupp said. During last night's discussion, students spoke about a broad range of undergraduate concerns, from quality-of-life issues to academic concerns. In addition to Rupp and Marcus, the panelists included School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) Dean David Auston, Associate Vice President for Arts and Sciences Caroline Bynum, and Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka. Marcus's discussion of administrative opinion concerning this year's Core curriculum experimentation came after Robert Gaudet, CC '94, delivered a series of complaints about the state of undergraduate life at Columbia. Among the concerns Gaudet raised was the belief that Columbia College students would be betterserved by a full-time dean capable of devoting his or her energies exclusively to the school. In response, Rupp argued that the administrative streamlining he initiated last summer served to heal the often-fractious relationships between the University's individual schools. Rupp's restructuring combined the offices of dean of Columbia College and vice president for Arts and Sciences, while also creating two associate vice president for Arts and Sciences positions that were filled by the deans of the School of General Studies (GS) and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). Former Columbia College Dean Jack Greenberg was replaced by Marcus at the time of the restructuring. Comparing the process to ""onestop shopping,"" Rupp said this system creates ""clear lines of responsibility"" which students can follow when bringing their concerns to administrators.The added responsibilities assigned to the dean of Columbia College reflect Rupp's desire to move Columbia College closer to the center ofUniversity life, Marcus said. Marcus admitted, however, that he has been less accessible to students than he would like to be, adding that ""as I learn the job better, I will have more office hours."" Regarding the quality of campus life, University Senator Emily Juda, CC '95, said many students have told her they will not contribute money to Columbia College as alumni because of a perceived ""lack of services"" during their undergraduate years, including inconsistent cleaning of dormitories and the lack of lighting in stairwells. ""I challenge one ofyou to stay in a dormitory for three days and see how you like it,"" Juda said, adding that the University is wasting crucial money that could be used to improve campus life. Rupp said while student services are ""not as good as they ought tobe,"" action to solve these problems has been hindered by the University's current budget crisis. He added, however, that there is no inconsistency between reducing expenditures and raising the quality ofliving conditions for undergraduates. ""We have a long way to go to make services more user-friendly,"" Rupp said. Students also discussed their fear that Columbia College is becoming overcrowded, as the number of students enrolling in the school increases with each first-year class, a phenomenon that they said manifests itself most vividly in certain overcrowded classes and in increasing demand for housing spaces. Unlike SEAS, whose student body is at its lowest level in 10 years, Marcus said the Columbia College student body presently comprises approximately 3,400 students, and will continue to rise gradually until it reaches 3,500, which Marcus said would be the cutoff point. Marcus said although a largercollege may eventually be desirable, additional resources would have to be spent to ensure better quality in both education and living conditions before the school could enlarge beyond 3,500 students. Students also criticized Columbia College's advising system, saying it provides them with little direction in terms of choosing a major. Rebecca Gee, CC '97, said the advising system needs to be improved, citing her own experience with a adviser who she said knew little about the Core, and did not even know her name. Bynum said the Committee on Undergraduate Education is exploring possible ways of improving the advising system, including appointing two student liaisons for each academic department who will be responsible for keeping undergraduates informed about changes in the departments, and for advising students who are deciding what major to choose. Two Columbia College pre-medstudents expressed concern about the presence of GS post-baccalau-reate students in their courses. While stressing that these students are ""of high quality,"" the students who spoke said they would like their performance evaluated in comparison to their peers, and not to GS students, who generally take fewer courses each semester. Bynum said options are being considered for redressing this problem, including grading on an absolute standard instead of on a curve. Rupp said he agreed with the concept of the town meeting, and expressed his appreciation to students for attending. ""I hear the deep concern you have with the quality of life and education, and the quality will improve,"" Rupp said. Students were generally impressed with the meeting. ""I think that for students who are not a part of student government, this meeting was very beneficial in gaining knowledge of what the main issues are on campus,"" said Wendi Winkler, CC '95.University President George Rupp said the quality of student life needs improvement during a town meeting with students. Deans Steven Marcus and Caroline Bynum also participated."
292,Music Humanities,Who should be on the frieze?,31 March 1994,"By SCOTT MACKENZIE and RAMIN MAJDWe would first like to congratulate Jeffrey Bellin [""Whatever You Want"" Spectator , Mar. 25] on his article entitled ""It's dme to renovate Buder."" Not that the article in question contained anything of interest; it merely provoked normally passive individuals (like us) to respond inkind. The kind of gender sellout and RC. nonsense expressed in the article progressed to such a degree that we couldn't avoid responding. A few words for Mr. Bellin: In 20 years, when you're rubbing your wife's feet after mowing the lawn on Super Bowl Sunday (all the while bemoaning Columbia's lack of respect for female writers), you might want to reflect upon your own life. We're sure your Columbia education and your keen knack for finding the bandwagon will ensure a comfortable suburban life for you and your loved ones. Your column is apdy tided, be-cause the content and nature of your opinions are just the sort of warmedover homilies people want to hear these days; worse, that people already have heard, over and over again, by folks a lot more intelligent (if no less misguided) than you. Reading your column is like listening to somebody scratching a chalkboard. We won't claim to be the literary experts Bellin professes to be (quick, Jeff—name three works by Cisneros), especially in relation to the works in question. We have, however, a familiarity with many of the authors discussed, and in our own humble opinion, we can say it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the works of Aristode appear to surpass —in terms of their social, political, and historical reverberations —those of Sappho. Forgive the assertion, we realize how unpopular honest opinions are these days. Accepting for a moment Bellin's opinion, however, we ask why else would one want to put Sappho on the Butler Library frieze while removing Aristotle? Because Sappho was a woman? How about all the great male authors who are not on the frieze who could be deemed moreworthy than Sappho? Where are Euripides, Tolstoy, and Machiavelli? And if you wish to include the works of Toni Morrison, then how about another contemporary Nobel Prize winner, like Ernest Hemingway, or even Saul Bellow? Or non-prize-win-ners who have been more influential than Morrison —Faulkner, Orwell, Dickens —who are white and male (and, yes, dead) instead of black and female? (Jeff —you might be a dead white man someday, too.) Underlining Beilin's blanket, simpleminded acceptance of trendy, ""enlightened"" politics is the fact that he didn't even question the omission of a number of genuinely great female writers from the banner, such as Dickinson and Austen. Perhaps Beilin's line of reasoning isn't so bad. We confess that Augustine couldn't be any less decipherable if we were reading his works in Latin. In fact, we just don't like City of God very much. We would prefer to read Sappho instead. In fact, we want to study works from our own inherited genre —white trash. We demand that Music Humanities include Motley Crue. In addition, Jerry Falwell, velvet Elvises, and Stephen King all de-serve a place in the core. If women can demand attention for their foremothers, then we can be granted a little sympathy for the self-righteous. We're tired of having our roots suppressed. Now then, we hope the absurdity of Bellin's first philosophy is clear. While we respect his right to disagree, we can no longer accept the imbecilic P.C. bile anymore, or the assertions of an implied moral high ground taken by those holier than everyone else. We asked a female colleag""e about the Butler banner when it was posted. She explained that the poster wasn't designed to suggest that the names on it should replace any of the names that currently decorate the frieze. This seems plausible enough, since the poster doesn't cover or obscure any of the names already there. It was an effort,she said, to draw attention to female authors, and in the context of Women's History Month, to promote awareness of women's issues in general. This isn't objectionable in itself; we should also recognize the fact that, whatever the circumstances, women were simply not granted the conditions to create the lasting imprssions of a Plato. Sorry. And we have no problems with anyone studying what he or she likes to, or attempting to bring awareness to pressing issues. It's tired and unnecessary to argue names in relation to the Core, or to argue about the Core itself. Such pieces inevitably come off as sermons or temper tantrums, a distinction with which we don't wish to be associated. We wish merely to vent the frustration reading such drivel as ""Whatever You Want"" provokes with some raving psychotic drivel of our own. Drivel it certainly is, but at least it's genuine.CounterpointScott MacKenzie and Ramin Majd are Columbia College sophomores."
293,Music Humanities,Debating the Core: Whither the west?,18 April 1994,"By MONICA MEHTA Spectator Staff WriterThe Columbia College faculty's March decision to replace the current Cultures and Issues requirement with a MajorCultures requirement that will focus exclusively on non-West-ern cultures is the latest phase of the evolution of the school's Core Curriculum into a program that is more inclusive of traditions and ideas from outside of Europe.Introduced in the wake of World War I, the Core Curriculum was originally meant to give students from different backgrounds experience in reading and interpreting the works that contributed to Western society. Over the years, the Core has expanded to include four required classes —Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), Art Humanities, and Music Humanities —and two semesters of classes which fulfill the current Cultures and Issues requirement. Since CC was first introducedin 1918 and Lit Hum was added in 1937, the Core has moved beyond an almost exclusively Greco-Ro-man emphasis to include more nonEuropean traditions and other historical periods, especially the Middle Ages and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In February, 1988, the Columbia College faculty passed a proposal to create the Cultures and Issues requirement that required students to complete either two semesters of courses dealing with non-European cultures or one nonEuropean cultures course, and one course on contemporary issues. But once instituted, some critics said the requirement, intended to make up for underrepresentation of non-European world areas in the Core, led to a fragmentation of learning instead of a concentrated study of other world cultures. During this academic year, theCC department has introduced a few experimental sections of the class. The experimental sections feature a syllabus that groups works on a thematic, rather than chronological basis, while other sections have expanded the usual syllabus to include more texts —such as the Koran —that have had important influence, but were not traditionally included in the class. Administrators have declined to comment on the experiments until after the classes have been completed next month. Despite the recent experimentation, many students and faculty members believe the Western focus of the Core should not be changed, at least not based on the criticism that the authors may espouse racist or elitist beliefs. Richard Billows, director of CC and an associate professor of history, said that as part of Western culture, Columbia must come to terms with the past before it can deal with the present or future. ""It might be wonderful if in the past people were treated equally, but they were not, and we can't hide that,"" Billows said. Billows also said he believes that the Core should not serve to fragment students into groups on the basis of their racial and ethnic backgrounds, but to unify them under the ideas of Western civilization.""This emphasis on difference, difference, difference, is a disease in modern society,"" Billows said. ""The Core is about understanding and developing a critical engagement with what the key ideas and traditions of Western culture are. There is no plan to make CC anything other than an introduction to Western culture."" The United Students of Color Council (USCC) and the Black Students' Organization (BSO) have been at the forefront of this year's calls to re-examine the Core. At a USCC panel discussion about the Core on March 1, BSO President Marie Louis, CC '94, criticized the absence of texts from the African tradition in the syllabi of CC and Lit Hum. Her complaint, Louis said, is based on the theory that much of the Western tradition has come from the African tradition. USCC Vice-Chair Bryonn Bain, CC '95, also emphasized the concern that although the Core need not represent the diverse student body, Columbia students are not receiving an accurate account of the origins of ideas in the texts. ""I don't think we should change [the Core] merely to duplicate the population at Columbia,"" Bain said. ""But for us to go out into the world and act as agents for change, we have to understand the foundationon which our history was built."" ""We can't do that by saying everything starts with Greece. We need to include classical texts from Asian and African traditions that influenced the Greek thinkers and philosophers,"" he added. School of General Studies (GS) Dean Caroline Bynum said she believed it was important that the Core include non-European works, particularly from the Judaic and Islamic traditions. ""I am happy with the Western emphasis in the Core as long as there is also emphasis on other traditions and as long as the Western texts are questioned in class discussion,"" Bynum said. Although many students feel that the American culture has taken elements from Eastern and Western traditions equally, Billows said Christianity's influence on the U.S. proves that the country derives most of its ideas from the West. ""American culture has developed as a Western tradition,"" said Billows. ""I don't think anyone would deny that fact."" Other students said they believe the Core should remain as it is because it has been a tradition for 75 years. ""I came to Columbia knowing that I would be studying a core of dead white men, and that's what I expected,"" Jimmy Hung, CC '95,said. Bynum and USCC are planning a lecture series entitled ""More on the Core"" next semester, in which guest speakers will offer ""experimental perspectives"" on non-West-ern texts in an attempt to reform the syllabi of the courses. ""They will present books of classical civilization outside the Western canon that have connection to Western civilization,"" Bain said. ""A lot of faculty members and administrators are for a change in the way courses are taught, and we're going to give them the chance to do that,"" USCC Political Chair Marcel Agueros, CC '96, said. Most advocates of Core reform agree that if the Core represents the University's idea of what is essential knowledge for every college student, Columbia is ignoring the rest of the world by excluding nonWestern texts from the course. ""The idea is that you're supposing a total domination of one region's thought and culture,"" Agueros said. Bain agreed, emphasizing the need for Core texts to give students a broad world view. ""We realize that ideas have no race, but the context in which we're learning tells us that any ideas of merit come from only one race,"" Bain said. ""The world is not built upon the ideas of only one race.""Defining diversity Fourth in a 6-part series"
294,Music Humanities,A modest proposal for a better Core,29 April 1994,"By JEREMY SENDEROWICZWhile Danny Franklin's article ""Core standards must not decrease"" [Spectator, April 19] raised many valid points about problemsfacing the Core, I felt that some unfair generalizations were made. Specifically, Franklin feels that graduate students, as a rule, are unfit to teach the Core. I can confidently say that this is not the case. Out of the four main Core classes, I had three graduate students as instructors, and the one actual professor I had was probably the least effective of the four. Put simply, there is no necessary link between someone's past teaching experience and how well he or she will teach a Core class. I do recognize, however, that there are problems with having graduate students teach the Core. As Franklin wrote, they may be ""green,"" both in terms ofteaching and learning. Undoubtedly, some of them are also teaching solely for financial reasons, and not because of their love for the Core and what it represents. However, Ido not have the sense that this is the prevailing attitude, and since my Core has been taught mostly by graduate students, I would probably have noticed if this were indeed the case. I honestly feel that most instructors do care deeply about the Core, and that most of the problems to which Franklin and others allude are onesof competence. Solving these problems is not impossible, and I have some proposals for how they might be overcome. 1. The Core departments should be more strict about examining prospective instructors to ensure that they really do know the material. Such knowledge is certainly the first qualification for teaching the Core, and people who fail to meet this requirement should be weeded out. 2) As far as teaching ability is concerned, student input should be solicited before possible greenhorns are already stuck with sections. Perhaps candidates for Core sections could teach sample lectures, which would be evaluated by students afterwards. Graduate students who cannot teach or lead discussions have no place teaching the Core, and the weedingout process should begin before they start teaching. Once instructors (professors as well as grad students) begin teaching the Core, the utmost attention should be paid to their student evaluations at the end of each semester. If certain people consis-tently receive terrible reports, they should be removed from the Core roster. These steps would, hopefully, ensure that only qualified and willing applicantswould be able to teach the Core. And I definitely agree with Franklin that all professors who meet these qualifications should be allowed to teach the Core, no matter what departmentthey work in. The new administration has been sending mixed signals about how it will improve instructor competence. On one hand, it has been increasing student evaluations, and has shown signs of actually paying attention to them, as well as talking about making teaching a more important part of faculty life. On the other hand, it has also acted as if students' concerns are not even secondary—not just with the infamous expanded Music Humanities sections, but with the anonymous Lit Hum sections. Added to the already anonymous Logic and Rhetoric, Art Hum, and Music Hum sections, this means that a student's Core experience depends on a lottery. The explanation given for the change in Lit Hum sectioning—to cut downon students switching sections —was more indicative of an attitude designed to protect incompetent instructors than of one concerned with a uniformly high quality of instruction. Hopefully, the administration will come down on the right side of this issue. However, in reforming the Core, we must be careful not to throw out the good with the bad. Just because some graduate students may not be great teachers does not mean we should block them all from the Core. Were the Core giants of old —such as Trilling, Van Doren, and Hofstader, among others—prevented from teaching the Core as graduate students? If so, then many Columbia students were undoubtedly deprived of a brilliant education. In seeking to emulate Columbia's ""Golden Age,"" when these professors walked the campus, we should not repeat old mistakes."
295,Music Humanities,A final farewell to Columbia,19 May 1994,"DANNY FRANKLINShortly after he took office as University President, Dwight D. Eisenhower convened a meeting of the faculty.""Fellow employees of the University,"" he began. One professor stood up and interrupted. ""General Eisenhower,"" he said, ""we are not employees of the University. We are the University."" The past four years have shown me the wisdom of that statement many times over. And now, as I begin the very emotional process of leaving the school and the city that have in many ways become my home, I find that my professors symbolize everything I have loved about Columbia, and everything I will miss. This university is a difficult place to like at times. Every student graduating today could write an anthology of Columbia horror stories. The complexity and malevolence of the bureaucracy makes the Pentagon look like a mom and pop store, and academic advisors are more difficult to find than the body of Jimmy Hoffa. Strangely, all that fades from memory when I try to think about what Columbia is and what it has meant tome. What remains are the images of my teachers, the men and women who took hold of my mind and shaped and reshaped it time and time again as if it were silly putty. I wish I could give an example of how my teachers have changed my life: some emblematic anecdote that sticks in my memory, and no doubt will continue to do so for years to come. There are many of them. I am afraid, however, that doing so would be misleading, like showing someone a brick to give a taste of what a cathedral is. No one moment couldcapture it all. Every assignedbook, every lecture, and (though it will only encourage them to assign more) every paper was a small but significant piece of the Columbia educa-tion my teachers have helped me build.Perhaps the most glorious thing I can say about this education and the men and women who helped me attain it, is that it is far from finished. Never again will I read a book without hearing the voices ofWallace Gray or Edward Tayler telling me to stick to the text and avoid the limitations that a pre-formed literary theory carries with it. Nor will I ever listen to a piece of music without the image of Cynthia Gessele joyfully dancing around her Music Humanities classroom. They have taught me that knowledge and understanding is not an endin itself. Its only purpose is to increase the power of a work of art. Enlightenment and enjoyment go hand in hand, and disregarding one necessarily comes at the expense at the other. I have always been startled by a certain professor's near-immortal influence on Columbia. Many, many times I have heard a professor say that their own sensibilities and styles were shaped by professors long dead. The ghosts of Lionel Trilling, Mark Van Doren, Richard Hofstadter, and Franz Boas still walk across College Walk, still haunt the classrooms ofHamilton Hall. If one sits attentively, you can still hear them in the voices of their students, our professors. In much the same way, the"
296,Music Humanities,Pointers to plan your first semester classes Finishing the Core early is key to Columbia College,28 August 1995,"Finishing the Core early is key to Columbia CollegeBy MAURICE B. TOUEG Spectator News EditorAny incoming Columbia College student who is not yet familiar with the words ""Core Curriculum"" may want to consider transferring to another, less rigorous institution, perhaps in Philadelphia or Ithaca. As a first-semester Columbian about to choose your first college classes, you should already know that the Core Curriculum will take up much of your time. In fact, the Core will define the structure of your schedule for the next two years, so it's a good idea to think about when you should take your Core classes now. Instead of reading the entire blue course catalog to choose your classes, all you need to read is this article —unless, of course, you don't want to bother thinking about school yet. My first semester I decided to take it easy and get adjusted to college life by taking only four classes. Going out every night was a regular practice and Broadway milkshakes at Tom's Diner were standard fare. Columbia recommends that students take either 15 or 16 points per semester to graduate on time. If you have advanced placement credits, you are in an even better position to take four classes. It is possible to take four classes adding up to 15 points, but you just have to know how to choose those classes. If your name falls in the first half of the alphabet, your first semester as a Columbia College student will be consumed with writing many, many papers for a class called Logic & Rhetoric, or ""L&R."" This class can at first be intimidating, because instructors actually assign homewprk, so my advice is thatif you have to take L&R first semester, do so with only three other classes. If you get lucky and are able to postpone L&R until second semester, fulfill either the language requirement (four points) or part of the science requirement during your first semester. Your second class should either be Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), a year-long survey class in Western literature, or Contemporary Civilization (CC), another staple of the Columbia College Core Curriculum focusing on Western philosophy, religion, and political science. My advice is to take Lit Hum now and save CC for'your sophomore year. Lit Hum is a big reader course so you will need to devote a large chunk of time for the class. My third suggested class is either Art Humanities or Music Humanities, the other main elements of the Core Curriculum. While some students save these classes until their final two years at school, completing one of them in the first semester is not a bad idea. You may even like them, as I did, and decide to take other advanced classes in the future. Your fourth class should be a class for you. If you are dying to take ""Principles of Economics,"" go for it. If you find the ""History of the City of New York"" an interesting topic, have a party, but if you take any advice from this article, don't limit yourself to required classes during your first semester. Do it like Mo and take calculus. And by the way, if you are scrounging for a point, take a gym class. You need two semester's worth to graduate, and the physical education department has about 20 different classes, so get physical and get that last point."
297,Music Humanities,MUSIC Symbolic Funk: Purple Reigns Again,5 October 1995,"Symbolic Funk: Purple Reigns AgainBy KEVIN GLENZThe public's appreciation of pop music acts depends as much upon the image of the artist as it does on the artist's music. Almost every single on the charts has a video to accompany it. Even a mediocre song can lodge itself in the heads of a consumer if he associates it with a hip image (i.e. TLC, the Beastie Boys).Conversely, once an artist becomes too hackneyed or eccentric for mass tastes, he faces a demoralizing and sometimes shocking drop in sales figures, regardless of the quality of his music. Apparently, changing one's name to an unpronounceable symbol and wearing tight pants with the seat cut out of them can leave a bad taste in the public's mouth. That's why the artist formerly known as Prince just isn't the pop culture icon that he used to be. Eleven years ago—back when he stillturned his head when someone yelled, ""Hey Prince!""—He made purple suits, purple motorcycles, and Purple Rain the hippest styles in the world, and he rode that multi-platinum wave throughout the remainder of the decade. Over time, though, the general image of Prince shifted from ""He's so cool!"" to ""He's so weird!"" He gave the world one gender-bending test after another, most notably appearing stark naked in front of pastel flowers on the cover of Lovesexy. His mammoth productivity reduced the impact of his new releases from the major media events that they once were: last November his unexpected limited issue of the notorious Black Album barely raised the media's eyebrows, and didyou even know that he released an album of new material (Come) last August? Anyone who says that the man's eccentricity detracts from his music, however, needs to turn off his television set and throw away his Rolling Stone magazine. The Gold Experience (Warner), Prince's latest release, is, even by Prince standards, a truly in-credible collection. His last few full-length albums provided many inspired moments, but a few embarrassments (The first to come to mind: Come' s Nine Inch Nails rip-off ""Loose!"" and anything with Tony M.); Gold delivers 12 new, solid gems that spotlight the dizzying versatility of the hardest working symbol in show business. Of course, he's still acting a little goofy. A Spanish-speaking announcer serves to reiterate the name change: ""Prince esta muerto.""Another operator, this one English-speaking, prefaces several songs—oops, I'm sorry, experiences—with instructions that sound like coos from a seductive museum tourguide. Also, he makes playful, passing references to the name change: ""This is your captain with no name speaking"" in ""P Control,"" and ""Don't worry about my name/ It's 2 long 2 remember"" in ""Now."" But, no question, the man is musically back at the top of his form. From the sweetness of ""Shhh"" (an immeasurable improvement over Tevin Campbell's rendition) and the mildly remixed ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,"" to the uniquely arranged pop of ""319"" and ""Gold,"" to the slamming party power of ""Now""and ""Billy Jack Bitch,"" The Gold Experience tops anything he's put out since Sign O' the Times in 1987. Splashes of Prince's prolific past swirl throughout Experience. The opening number, ""P Control,"" represents the explicit funk of the Black Album. ""I Hate U"" echoes the gorgeous 1987 ballad ""Adore."" ""Dolphin"" could be a coda to Lovesexy' s ""Glam Slam."" Arena-sized guitar riffs and ""yah-yah-yow!""screams in ""Endorphinmachine"" recall the rock 'n' roll badness of Purple Rain. And damn if those synths in ""Billy Jack Bitch"" aren't straight outta 1999. Still, The Gold Experience by no means is a stale rehash of old styles. He never records a song without barrelsful of energy. On the slower numbers, he funnels that energy into some amazing orchestration: The drums that open ""Shhh"" jostle the ears marvelously, setting the stage for the breakdown to follow; later, a searing and inimitable guitar solo ties up the courtroom fury of ""I Hate U."" When he ups the tempo, he ensures that U won't sit still, especially on ""Billy Jack Bitch,"" the catchiest and slammingest dance track he's recorded since ""Alphabet St."" This artist likes to dip his feet into many waters, and, as usual, he can pull anything off. ""Shy"" gives acoustic earnestness that makes Hootie and the Blowfish look even duller than they already are."
298,Music Humanities,New report to reconsider two irreconcilables,25 January 1996,"SCOTT MacKENZIEBleachUniversity Provost Jonathan Cole's longawaited report on the feasibility of increasing the size of Columbia College, delivered to faculty members in December, appears to confirm what students know and fear: the University's undergraduate population is expanding and will continue to grow. Despite the efforts of the administration to withhold the study from public scrutiny until the latest date, general impressions and discreet sources indicate the report does not depart from existing policy in any meaningful way, and leaves those concerns important to students unaddressed. The current administration made the expansion of the College a guiding priority as University President George Rupp assumed office in 1993- Among the first documents to land on his desk was the final report ofColumbia's Strategic Planning Commission, convened to recommend policies and goals the University might achieve by the year 2000. The group was chaired by (surprise, surprise) Provost Cole, and put forward a variety of proposals. Initiatives advocating fundamental change to the Core Curriculum (remember those wonderful Music Humanities experimental sections), and rejecting the notion of new programs outside the existing departments (ever ponder the University's refusal to create Ethnic Studies programs) originated here. The commission's final report introduced the idea to expand the school, and linked it to the notion of generating a greater focus on undergraduate education. Rupp then touched on the importance of Columbia College to the University constructin his inaugural address, although he wisely failed to mention the projected expansion. His decision was a wise one, I think, because the student body recognized then and realizes now that an increased number of students does not suggest greater quality in education. While administrators remain committed to the idea, students regard their school in different terms. Resources preoccupy—the last few rounds of budget cuts crippled several departments and programs we care about. The everyday experience of many students consists of war-story depic-tion of housing shortages, overcrowded or locked-out classes, and increased bureaucratic hassle. As the Strategic Planning Commission gave way to other short-lived enterprises, administrators publicly began consideration of a 15 percent increase in Columbia College class size. A study completed in 1994, structurally similar to the one presented to faculty members in December, attached three main conditions: Improvements to Columbia's library and physical fitness facilities, construction of additional residence halls, and, most importantly, the maintenance of the selectivity of Columbia College. Administrative policy has since directed efforts toward satisfying the proscribed requirements. The University recently completed renovations to the gym; ambitious programs for Butler await sufficient funding. Columbia plans to erect a large dormitory in the immediate future —on hold because of community protest (it seems the University's up to its old tricks). The administration worked hard to increase the applicant pool and the recent influx of new students in recent years hasn't affected the acceptance rates and SAT averages administrators really care about. Students, however, do not celebrate these efforts. The importance of the 1994 study lies in the omissions, not the inclusions. No conditions to preserve the integrity of the Core Curriculum. No contingency plans to deal with possible effects on need-blind admissions policy. No steps to alleviate the additional burden to existing departments. In short, the report failed to recommend the increase in resources that seems a necessary companion to any expansion scheme. So Columbia College expanded—through miscalculation, underestimation, and through secret operation by the University's high officers. Lack of foresight contributed to the disasters suffered in the past year. The University's creation of an ad hoc committee to oversee the financial aid duties of the UndergraduateOffice of Admissions, that group's enforcement of a relaxed deadline (leaving hundreds of needy students out in the cold), and the subsequent admission of students off the non-financial aid waiting list compromised Columbia's need-blind admissions policy. The scandal revealed the University's inability to satisfy the policy's demands for a larger class size. Cutting rather than expanding resources for financial aid stretched needblind to its limit; the expanded incoming class size pushed it beyond budget capacities. The administration's cynical reaction betrayed the trust of students and professors who took a pay cut several years ago to preserve the policy. The effects on class composition, especially minority enrollment, became obvious. The Arts and Sciences, specifically the Department of English and Comparative Literature became another-casualty of administrative policy. The loss of 20 percent of its faculty due to budget cuts leaves the department hard-pressed to fulfill obligations, including administration of Logic and Rhetoric and Literature Humanities sections. The stress on professors makes it difficult for undergraduate and graduate students to obtain the attention they require and allows little time for faculty contribution to a variety of programs—the gender institute and the African American studies program. The damage led the administration to temporarily abandon its squeeze play; Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen authorized three new faculty appointments for the 1996-7 year in November. This semester, the department's difficulties in coping with the increasing numbers of students is evident. Overcrowding resulted in the inability of students to enroll in the department's popular Contemporary American Fiction class. As students filled the aisles and occupied the floors of Hamilton's largest lecture room, Professor of Writing Richard Locke moved to preserve the integrity of the class, or, at least, to prevent a potential fire hazard. An alleged decree by the Committee on Instruction or some other body precipi-tated a mass exodus of freshmen, sophomores, and Barnard students. This official hierarchy for College classes, like the ad hoc committee in the admissions office is a bad policy, an emergency effort designed to cope with the unforeseen consequences of increasing class size. These instances exemplify the potential fundamental effects of the measures under consideration. Growth affects every facet of the community and demands a degree of consideration the administration's practices have so far lacked. It's not a solution to Columbia's financial woes. Through these studies, the provost and other official optimists endeavor to convince us that the combination of the largest budget cuts to the Arts and Sciences in the history of the University and one of the largest increases to class size in recent memory has not and will not lead to certain disaster. According to Cole, the two lead magically to the enhancement of undergraduate education at Columbia—a phrasestudents, weary from the above deseribed events, cannot trust. I'm told the newest feasibility study, euphemistically entitled ""Enhancing the Quality of Undergraduate Education at Columbia,"" reaffirms the importance of the Core Curriculum and need-blind admissions —in word. It assumes expansion is feasible without ""appreciable effect on the learning environment,"" a point argued over and over by Cole. Without the commitment of additional resources, rapid expansion of Columbia College will continue in abject failure. Professors seemed resigned to the results of the report, not enthusiastic. That suggests to me current trends will continue. In terms of improving the quality of the educational opportunities offered by the College, increased class size has proved a bankrupt policy characterized by repeated catastrophe, and will undermine the ability of the University to live up to its lofty responsibilities.Scott MacKenzie, CC '96, whitens whites on alternate Thursdays in Spectrum."
299,Music Humanities,Study plans for growth of Columbia College Feasability study's details include possible closure of River Hall,5 February 1996,"Feasability study's details include possible closure of River HallBy KIM VAN DUZER Spectator Staff WriterMajor changes affecting the undergraduate community —including plans to close River Hall, the construction of a new 420-bed residence hall, and the creation of an additional 42 sections of Core classes —comprise the finer points of the long-awaited written report on the University's proposed plans to expand Columbia College. The report, entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia,"" described River Hall as ""a poor quality facility that probably does not merit further capital investments,"" and said the closing of River, along with the construction of a new residence hall at the proposed 113 th Street and Broadwaysite and an $8 million renovation project for Wien and Woodbridge Halls, ""will result in a significant improvement in the quality of Columbia's undergraduate residence halls."" According to the report, the renovation projects and the construction of a new student center to replace Ferris Booth Hail (FBH) are two principal initiatives that will be financed in part by the increased revenue resulting from an increase in Columbia College enrollment. In its analysis of the effects of increased enrollment on class size, the report concluded that fixed-enrollment Core classes—including Literature Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, andLogic and Rhetoric classes—would require the greatest increase in number of sections with 42, while courses such as languages, labs and seminars would only require a few additional sections to accommodate increased enrollment. According to the report, the additional sections of Core courses will be taught by a mix of junior faculty and graduate student preceptors. University Provost Jonathan Cole stressed that there would be no increase in the maximum size of Core classes, andsaid an effort would be made to maintain a ratio of onethird senior faculty, one-third junior faculty and one-third graduate students teaching Core classes, though the report does not mention the addition of senior faculty members to accommodate an increase. ""We may have to have senior faculty teaching more than one section of certain Core courses, but we will try to maintain that ratio,"" Cole said. According to the report, a 15percent increase in enrollment will ' have less of an effect on lecture courses in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, though the report projects that the social sciences, which currently have the highest average enrollment per class with 50, would experience the largest increase in average class size. Cole pointed out that in 1994-95, the majority of classes had enrollments of less than 29 students, and only four percent of classes had 100 or more students. ""There is a common misperception that most of our classes arc ifiese large lecture classes, but in reality we have an overwhelming number of small classes,"" Cole said. Cole noted, however, that within more popular majors such as English, history and economics, and within smaller majors such as German and classics, these distributions vary greatly. In evaluating the effects of increased enrollment on centrallymanaged services such as financial and academic computing services,the report created a ""place-holder"" cost of $933 per student to account for the possible expansion of such services that the increased enrollment may necessitate. According to the report, however, ""it is likely that very few administrative units will need any additional resources to accommodate 530 additional students over the current University-wide student enrollment of roughly 20,000."" Many of the goals for enhancing the quality of undergraduate life outlined in the report arc an outgrowth of the results of the annual Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) Senior Survey in which outgoing students rate their satisfaction with Columbia in areas such as academic advising, administration responsiveness, food services, sense of community, climate for minorities, and ethnic/racial diversity. In the past, student responses to the areas covered in the survey ranged from ""generally dissatisfied"" to ""very dissatisfied"" in almost everyarea. Climate for minorities and ethnic/racial diversity on campus were the only two areas with which students said they were ""generally satisfied"" with Columbia. The survey, which also compared Columbia's results to those of six other research universities, including Harvard University, Yale University, Dartmouth College, and Georgetown University, found Columbia student satisfaction well below the median and often on the low end of student satisfaction at other schools. According to the report, plans for renovations of existing residence halls, the construction of a new residence hall, and the construction of the new student center will improve Columbia's performance in many of the areas covered by the survey and also increase Columbia's rate of student satisfaction. In examining the potential increase in revenue that would result from a 15 percent increase in the size of Columbia College, the report projects that an additional $l3-1 million per year will be brought in by the academic year 2007-08. According to the report, approximately half of the increased revenues will be used to cover ""variablecosts,"" which include financial aid, housing expansion, administrative support, and instructional and academic support costs. ""Academic enhancements,"" which involve improvements in the academic departments of the arts and sciences, will receive approximately one-third ofthe additional revenues. According to Cole, ""academic enhancements"" could entail hiring new faculty members, maintaining faculty quality through raises for faculty members, and possibly adding classes in new areas of study such as Latino Studies. The remainder of the increased revenues will be targeted for ""student quality enhancements,"" which relate to the new student center and the renovations of Wien and Woodbridge. Cole said his administration will be consulting with the University Trustees on the series of proposed actions in the report, though the proposal will not be formally voted on by the Trustees. Member of the Student Committee for the Future of Columbia Avi Green, CC '96, said an increase in enrollment will make achieving the goal of a more cohesive University community impossible. ""There is absolutely no argument that a larger class size brings any good in and of itself except for more money,"" Green said. ""There is no question that there is a sense at Columbia that the community is fragmented, and it is only going to get worse with an increase."" Green also said he was concerned that the increased revenue would not necessarily all go back to Columbia College. ""All the money made from an increase should be spent on the College,"" Green said, ""and I don't see any guarantee of that.""Advocates of ethnic studies programs spoke last night at a Columbia College Student Council meeting."
300,Music Humanities,"Include in Core, don't segregate as major",12 February 1996,"By STEPHAN WHITAKERFinally. A rally, a sit-in, something to get excited about on this campus again! Watching the ethnic studies movement over the past month, I was elated to see students overcoming their apathy. But I was also distressed to see so many students supporting such a divisive proposal. Few students have been un-PC enough to suggest that the academic resources and student energies would promote more true scholarship and understanding if directed toward expanding the Core. While Columbia may need to emphasize the Western tradition because the United States is primarily a Western nation, we would be foolish to deny ourselves the wisdom of Africa and Asia simply because most Americans are not genetically linked to these regions. The Columbia community should consider replacing the major cultures requirement with a two-semester seminar course that explores the literature and philosophies of Asia and Africa. This would mean a sacrifice of flexibility in choosing classes, but it would provide a broad background that the specialized major culturescourses can't provide. Otherwise, we could let the new class replace Art and Music Humanities requirements. The substance of Eastern traditions is more important than the soundtrack and visuals that accompanied Western traditions. In any case, deserving works from the Latin American and Islamic traditions should be added to Lit Hum and CC because these cultures are unquestionably linked to the Western tradition. Columbia shouldn't expand the Core just so that everyone is represented and enjoys that ""diversity = unity"" feeling. Hopefully most students recognize that the literary and philosophical merits of a work are more important than the genetics of the author. Even if Columbia's student body was still rich, white, and male, it would be well advised to study the texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and others because every student should have the opportunity to embrace or reject these ideas. Plato is only half the story. Applying this same test (regardless of ethnic politics, is the subject matter worth studying?) delivers a different verdict on ethnic studies. To present the case, I'll respond to several of the Ad-Hoc Committee on Ethnic Studies' statements:Ad-Hoc: Asian Americans and Latinos have made a valuable contribution to the American experience and academics have simply ignored it. Let us be realistic —there have not been enough Asians and Latinos in America long enough to justify these majors. Latinos did not start immigrating in large numbers until after WWII. Asian-Americans were less than one percent of the population until immigration in the '7os and 'Bos brought that number up to 33 percent (8.5 million). If you want to know about the contributions of these ethnic groups, you need to hire a prophet, not a professor. Ad-hoc: We have never argued that Asian American studies should be created to please Columbia's Asian American community. Who was putting up posters saying, ""25 percent in the College, 35 percent in SEAS, zero percent in the Curriculum""? The members of the Ad-Hoc committee subconsciously want to prove that Asian Americans can demand a major as African Americans de-manded the Institute. Latinos, Jews, Homosexuals, Native Americans, you won't be outdone, will you? Ad-hoc: A majority of the student body supports ethnic studies. Students nod in agreement because they are terrified of being labeled racists for disagreeing with a politi-cally-correct initiative. Ad-hoc: The administration has recognized the academic value of Asian American studies in a report issued by its own committee. This is one stalling tactic the Ad-Hoc committee failed to recogni7.e. If the administration denied the value of Asian-American studies, they would have to refute accusations of racism and then debate the merits of the discipline. By saying, ""It's a good idea, but we can't afford it,""the administration makes the debate a financial matter, which guarantees they will never have to create the program. Ad-hoc.- This is not about studying ourselves; it is about presenting our experiences to the community. Columbia students are only slightly less ethnocentric than citizens of the former Yugoslavia. Ethnic clubs dominate campus social life; many students study the language they spoke at home; organizations based on universalist religions becomeethnically homogeneous; classes pertaining to certain cultures are taken disproportionately by students ethnically linked to the subject matter. Despite Columbia's incredible diversity, students probably spend more than 70 percent of their time with ""their own kind."" Ethnic studies programs will continue this segregation. Asian Americans and Latinos will study themselves and the rest of us will remain unenlightened. Ad-hoc: There is plenty of material to constitute ethnic studies majors. In this information age, there is plenty of material on anything. There may be four years worth of readings on plumbers. Should we have plumber studies? Undergraduate education is focused on a major, but it is still very general. History majors don't learn all of human history; they learn how to study, interpret, and write about history. Likewise, someone interested in Asian American or Latino studies can study sociology, anthropology or history and then specialize when they pursue their doctorate and academic career. Ad-hoc: All we need is a couple professors to teach afew classes and advise the prog ram. As last year's uproar about the speech department demonstrated, one professor is a major investment. Advising? At Columbia?Whatever. Ad-hoc: The University of Nebraska hai eight professors in their Asian A merican studies program and dozens of other schools have similar programs. The University of Nebraska can afford super-specialized majors because it has ten times as many students as Columbia. Smaller schools that give into the divisive pressures of ethnic-academics will suffer as their departments are torn into uncooperative, ineffective little pieces. Now run to your computers and whip out a letter denouncing my ignorance. Feel free to vent your frustrations on me so that everyone else who disagrees with ethnic studies can come out of hiding. I really wish I didn't have to argue against an active and dedicated student group, but I had to add my own two cents about this misguided movement. Hopefully, we can refocus student energies toward the more worthy goal of expanding the Core. In five or six years, we might be graduating 850 people who have encountered all of the world's cultures. And that half-dozen who would have majored in ethnic studies can specialize where specialization belongs—in grad school. In the mean time, I'll go home and wait for my bomb threats.Stephan Whitaker is a Columbia College sophmore."
301,Music Humanities,Faculty react to planned increase Professors divided over effects of increase in Columbia College,19 February 1996,"Professors divided over effects of increase in Columbia CollegeBy ADRIENNE CARTER Spectator Staff WriterThe debate over the proposed increase in the size of Columbia College is being waged throughout all segments of the University, from students to administrators to staff members. One of the groups that will be most affected by the planned additions is the faculty—many of whom were divided on the ramifications of the increase. According to the report, entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia,"" University administrators have proposed increasing the size of Columbia College from 3,500 students to approximately 4,000 by 2002. Assistant Director of AfricanAmerican Studies Curtis Stokes said the increase will negatively affectthe undergraduate experience at Columbia College and in the end, students will feel the greatest consequences. ""I am disturbed because my understanding is that Columbia College is committed to academic excellence and implicit in academic excellence is the idea that students should be a priority. That is undermined when the size of the class is significantly increased,"" Stokes said. ""One has to certainly, as an instructor, be concerned about what the future holds for the students."" However, Chair of the Physics Department Professor of Physics Norman Christ said he is enthusiastic about the prospects of the increase, saying it will allow the physics department to do more in way of scientific research. ""I think most of the science department, certainly physics is small compared to other departments at competing universities. Anything that goes in the direction of going larger is of benefit to the University,"" Christ said. ""In general, it's better to get bigger than smaller."" The report concluded that in order to maintain the size of lim-ited-enrollment Core classes —including Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Logic and Rhetoric classes—an additional 42 sections would be necessary. According to the report, lecturecourses in the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities will be the least affected by the increase because of the high registration already in those classes. However, there will be some increases to various classes, but the affect of this increase varies, according to Columbia College faculty members. Chair of the Anthropology Department Alexander Alland Jr. said the anthropology department will not feel the effects of an increase in the class size. ""I don't think it will affect the [anthropology department]. Our classes have always ranged from small to large depending on the entry level,"" Alland said. Chair of the Sociology Department Mary Ruggie said the increase in the number of students will affect classes in different ways. For instance, she said, with larger classes that have over 75 people the effect will be great if there aren't enough discussion sections. ""We already have a couple of classes that are really large. If you can't have extra discussion classes, they won't have'as good of an experience,"" Ruggie said. ""When [the classes] get to be too big, there isn't as much discussion."" However, she said, classes with only 50 people will not be affected as much ""if there are just.minimal increases. Chair of the Religion Department Wayne Proudfoot said classes in the religion department are already too large and the size increase will only add to the problem. ""Some of our classes are too large already because of the Major Cultures requirement,"" Proudfoot said„ With the increase in class size for Columbia College and the possible effect on various courses, faculty members agreed that additional resources in most departments will be necessary to facilitatethe increase. However, professors were split over whether or not the administration will parallel the increase in students with an increase in resources. Higgins Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Chemistry Department George Flynn said the administration has proposed an increase in labs as well as teaching assistants in order to deal with an increased students load in the chemistry department. ""The incremental costs have been calculated quite well,"" Flynn said. ""Nobody is trying to pull a fast one with regards to budgetary calculations."" Similarly, Alland said his department will be able to handle an increase because there were already plans in motion to hire new faculty members before the announcement. ""We're recruiting faculty. [The increase in faculty] depends on who we get, but it's a very significant number,"" Alland said. ""We're hoping to have these people in place by next year."" Christ said he believes added resources—such as labs and discussion sections —are needed, but the current faculty will be able to handle extra students. ""I think there is enough flexibil-ity [in the physics faculty] that we can deal with a 10 percent increase [in students] without too much increase in faculty,"" Christ said. However, Proudfoot said he was unsure of whether there will be sufficient support systems to handle the extra students. ""It can't be done without the resources,"" Proudfoot said. ""The report from the administration says resources will be made available, but it's not really quite clear [what those resources will be] right now."" Proudfoot added that hiring additional teaching assistants is especially crucial in light of the new proposal. ""It's very hard to teach it in the proper way if we don't have enough teaching assistants,"" Proudfoot said. Ruggie is similarly unsure if the current resources are enough to deal with the extra students ""What we would like to do is have more discussion sections,"" Ruggie said. Ruggie also said an increase in professors would help make the students' experience in the sociology department a better one. ""We wish there were going be more professors; we're just not sure that's going to happen,"" Ruggie said."
302,Music Humanities,"Cole, Quigley, and Cohen present plan Cole says plans to close River Hall are now 'off-line'",28 February 1996,"Cole says plans to close River Hall are now 'off-line'By ADRIENNE CARTER Spectator Staff WriterWith only a month a half until Columbia College admissions officials mail out acceptance letters, University administrators say the size of the Class of 2000 has yet to be determined, as the debate over class size continues among students, administrators, faculty, and staff members within the University. University Provost Jonathan Cole released a letter to the faculty on Monday addressing numerous issues and questions that have been ""raised repeatedly"" over the course of the class size debate. Cole, Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley, and Vice President for Arts and Science David Cohen also addressed various concerns at a presentation to an audience of approximately 10 students. In the original report entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia"" released by the University at the end of January, administrators proposed a 15 percent increase in class size—a total of 530 additional students—by the year 2000. The report also called for the closing of River Hall, the construction of a new 420-bed residence hall, and the creation of 42 new sections of limited enrollment Core classes such as Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Logic and Rhetoric. However, after the concerns offaculty members, students, and alumni became evident in committee meetings, town meetings, and other venues, the administration, according to the faculty letter, has ""learned a great deal and have also been able to articulate more fully the benefits and risks associated"" with the proposed class size increase. One of the main concerns of the student body voiced in various meetings has been the closing of RiverHall. River, which was originally slated to be closed down because it was, according to the original report, ""a poor quality facility that probably does not merit further capital investments,"" was the subject of a study conducted by engineers that was influential in determining the status of the residence hall last year. However, in the Monday meeting with students Cole said plans to take River Hall ""offline"" are being reconsidered. ""We're now going to take another look,"" Cole said. This change is due in large part, Cole said, to the reaction of the students. According to Cole, plans are in the works for another engineering study as well as a look intohow River's closing will affect the ""sense of community."" ""Although cost will be an important factor in the University's ultimate decision regarding River —including the opportunity cost of not being able to undertake improvements in other buildings—students' sentiments regarding this facility will also be fully heard and taken into account,"" Cole said in the letter to the faculty. Students and faculty were also concerned about the effects the proposed increase would have on the Core classes and instruction in various departments. While the University still plans to add 42 section of the limited enrollment Core classes, Cole said the administration has taken the necessary steps to add an additional eight instructors who will be responsible in part forteaching some core classes. Similarly, Cohen said the University ""has been moving forward""in adding more faculty to the departments in which the largest number of students major. According to Cohen, the economics department is in the process of getting five new senior hires, while the political science department hopes to bring in four new professors, and the department of English and comparative literature has been given authorization to start recruiting new faculty, Cohen said. Cohen also said the University will ""begin to manage faculty hiring,"" which would include making more professors responsible for teaching in the Core, a practice which, he added, the University has moved away from in recent years. The issue of the new residence hall was also addressed in both the faculty letter and the panel discussion. According to the letter, the decision to build a 420-bed residence hall has not yet been finalized. The decision, ""that needs to be made over the next several years,"" is contingent on two factors—""whether there are sufficient gift funds to carry out the project and whether [the University is] confident that [administrators] will proceed to the full 15 percent enlargement,"" Cole said in the letter. Even if the University decides to go ahead with the construction and then stops expanding Columbia College, Cole said in the letter, they will ""sell"" the extra beds to the School of Engineering and Applied Science or to Bar-nard. ""In the event that neither of these schools [are] interested in 'purchasing' undergraduate residence space, [the University can] transform a number of small off-campus residences nowused for undergraduates to graduate students housing,"" Cole said in the letter. Quigley similarly addressed how he hopes the plan will ""promote the further development of the house system,"" as well as foster a sense of community within the University. Quigley said that in order to further thr house system it is necessary to have a different center of social interaction.

Quigley said the creation of social events that ""bridge"" various groups within the community including faculty and alumni are also included in the plan to increase the sense of community.

According to Cole, the Monday meeting which addressed various student and facultx concerns, is most likely the last formal meeting with students ""I don't think we'll have another meeting before we actually have to make a decision about the incoming class,"" Cole said.

303,Music Humanities,SPECTATOR PERSPECTIVES Professors say teaching should remain a priority Lectures and seminars provide different classroom experiences,27 March 1996,"Professors say teaching should remain a priorityLectures and seminars provide different classroom experiencesBy SANDRA P. ANGULO Spectator Staff WriterAlthough Columbia is not among the five Ivy League schools in the annual U.S. News and World Report listing of the top 24 schools ranked for effectiveness of undergraduate teaching [""America's Best Colleges"", Sept. 18, 1995], there are many professors who would argue that Columbia's dedication to undergraduates is evident in its commitment to maintaining the Core Curriculum and offering a variety of departmental and interdisciplinary seminars. Faculty members claim they are often unintentionally omitted from debates about expanding the class size, decreasing the number of faculty members, and overcrowding in Core classes, which have focused on the student or administrative perspective. Professors, many of whom serve on committees that help analyze and formulate University policies that affect student life, are more aware of important issues and more dedicated to the cause of bettering undergraduate education than a ranking in U.S .News and World Report can indicate. The Importance of Maintaining the Core Six professors in different fields of study unanimously asserted their belief in the benefits of teaching Core classes and mentioned the necessity of retaining strict limits on the number of students within Core sections.. Director of Contemporary Civilization Wim Smit, who has taught at Columbia for more than 30 years, said the Core is inextricable from Columbia's reputation for excellence. ""The Core is basically an education in reading and thinking about the most importantsocial issues and cultural concepts in our history,"" Smit, who has taught Contemporary Civilization, as well as Art and Music Humanities, said. ""Contemporary Civilization, for example, is not a disciplinary course but one in which the teachers as well as the students learn the basic problems and developments of social life and try to understand them through discussion."" Professor of History Marcia Wright, who also teaches Contemporary Civilization, said Core classes provide a unique opportunity for familiarity and in-depth discussion. ""While teaching the Core you can expect people to read the material and come to class prepared to discuss it,"" she said. ""It's quite a distinction from teaching a lecture in which the students don't usually speak."" While these professors enjoy teaching their respective Core classes, Smit recognized that fewer professors offer to teach the Core due to both the increasing number of professors who are on sabbatical each year and overwhelming time constraints that result from teaching in individual departments. ""In the 30 years since I've been here, the teacher-to-student ratio has become less favorable, in Core classes especially, where there are fewer professors than there used to be,"" he said. v- Hilary Ballon, Professor of Art History and Art Humanities, said that despite Columbia's low ranking in U.S. News and World Report, she considers the Core Curriculum to be an indication that undergraduate teaching is a significant issue at Columbia. ""I regard Columbia as an environment where undergraduate teaching is taken very seriously, and the Core Curriculum testifies to that,"" she said.Despite Columbia's notoriety as the smallest Ivy League school, it is common for an undergraduate to sit in at least one or two lecture courses a semester with as many as 150 to 200 other students. Professors of Columbia's larger introductory and most popular lecture courses must sometimes resort to turning students away or petitioning for an accommodating classroom. For every seemingly overcrowded lecture, however, there are also an adequate number of seminar courses that departments usually offer to juniors and seniors. All of the professors interviewed recognized the distinction between teaching behind a lectern in a classroom with over 100 students, and sitting at a table with six to 12 students in a seminar, but none of them claimed to prefer one to the other. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Franco Moretti taught at Italian universities for 19 years before moving to New York six years ago. Since then, his lecture in 20th Century Fiction has attracted more than 150 students each fall. Moretti said preparing for a lecture is an exercise in organization. ""Since I have to prepare in English, which is my second language, I have to prepare more carefully,"" he said. ""Since I don't master all of the nuances of the language, lectures get more black and white and extra clarity is inevitable."" Professor of Anthropology Terence D'Altroy, who began teaching at Columbia 14 years ago, also teaches over 150 undergraduates in his introductory course Rise of the Civilization, but heads a seminar in archeology with only 10 students. D'Altroy noted that the biggest difference between teaching a seminar and a large lecture is the requirement of student participation. ""Most students don't do all of the assignments for a lecture course —that's standard —and because of that, the upper division seminars cause students to think more than in the lower division lectures,"" D'Altroy said. ""You don't have room to deal with ambivalence in large lectures, which are more straightforward."" Like D'Altroy and Moretti, Donald Hood, Professor of Neuropsychology, teaches to more than 160 students each fall, but he also holds a 10-student seminar in his apartment called Mind and Brain, which he co-teaches with his wife, who is a neurosurgeon. ""Clearly we can't teach all of our courses to 10 students, and there is a certain order to first teaching the vocabulary of a field and then to do something more in-depth in an advanced course,"" Hood said. Moretti stressed how conciseness and spontaneity are necessary to teaching an undergraduate lecture. ""Clarity is the quality of enlightenment; if a professor is clear he establishes an equality with his students,"" he said. ""If you're not clear people can't disagree with you, which is very cozy, but it's a coziness at the expense of lack of intelligence."" On the other side of the teaching spectrum are professors who continually teach small lectures and seminars, partly because the nature of their courses is more specialized than popular introductory or survey courses. Professor of History Marcia Wright, who specializes in African History, has never taught a class to more than 50 students in her 30 years at Columbia. ""I think it is a lot better for a student to have an instructor who reads and grades all of their work instead of having it graded by a teaching assistant,"" she said. ""I don't condemn big classes, but there is something to be said for having an instructor who knows you."" Similarly, Smit teaches lecture classes to an average of 30 students and seminar classes to six or seven students. ""I've never done or taught a survey lecture course; I would hate to give one of thoselectures which are a series of informational facts,"" he said. ""Even a seminar with more than 10 students makes it much more difficult to concentrate on the issues at hand; I like a seminar in which no one is silent."" Changing Times at Columbia One of the questions that tenured professors are more qualified to answer is how undergraduates' attitudes and perceptions have changed throughout their teaching careers. Smit, who began teaching in 1965, said students are much less politically aware than they used to be in the '6os. ""I came here during a rather turbulent time when there was an active political community both on the left and the right, not just the students involved in the 'Columbia revolution,' but also their opponents,"" he said. ""In the late '7os, that began to disappear, and now I find that the majority of students are apolitical and not interested in taking a stand."" Wright agreed with Smit and said this generation of undergraduates is more cautious than the one preceding it. ""Different temperaments seem to rule at different times; this generation is very careful and has lost a whole sense of political alterna-tives that were alive and relished by the generation of the late '6os and early 705,"" Wright said. However, Hood, who began teaching at Columbia in 1969, said that, fundamentally, undergraduates students haven't stopped being politically involved. ""The number of students helping the homeless or taking a year after college to work in the public services hasn't changed,"" Hood said. ""Only the way you see mobilization on campus changes, but that is a sign of the environment in which 20-year-olds are put, not a sign of change in the 20-year-olds."" Undergraduate and Graduate Students The cross-section of professors interviewed said undergraduate teaching is a more exhilarating experience than graduate teaching, because undergraduates tend to ask more provocative questions, challenge the professor's assertions, and force the professor to offer stimulating material. Hood said it was the biggest surprise of his career to enjoy undergraduate teaching more than graduate teaching. ""I find it more enjoyable to teach undergrads because they are more open to being wrong,"" he said. ""Once people enter grad school theybecome young professionals really fast, which restricts their possibilities."" Ballon said her experience with undergraduates demonstrates how fulfilling it is to be a professor. ""It is said for every exciting discussion in an undergraduate seminar there is a graduate seminar that is stiff and more silent, because the expectations change radically,"" she said. ""Undergraduates have a much bolder approach to their educations."" The Faculty's Vision for the Future When asked about the validity of Columbia administrators' proposal to increase the class size, more than half of the professors expressed their concern that faculty resources would not increase as the number of students increases. Some of the problems highlighted by faculty members include the decrease of faculty hires in the past 10 years, the lack of adequate classroom space, and, most notably, the need to add extra Core Curriculum sections to accommodate the extra students. ""I think any kind of increase in enrollment would make it difficult to continue what I call the real Columbia education,"" Smit said. ""The Columbia education is one in which"
304,Music Humanities,SPECTATOR SPECTRUM Beatles' music merits inclusion,1 April 1996,"Beatles ' music merits inclusionPETER FREEMANLand of the FreeTrue Beatles fans will forgive Paul, George, and Ringo for endangering the band's legacy by releasing the ""Anthology"" series. Although the first two offerings provide little insight into the growth of the band and rest on the novelty value of several horrendous tracks, the Beatles' reemergence in the public spotlight allows a chance to evaluate the band nearly a quarter-century after its demise. ""Anthology 2"" is the number-one album not for its quality, but for its link to a masterful period of creativity —a period yet another generation may discover if sales of Rubber Soul and Revolver rise. For Columbia, renewed interest in the Beatles provides a chance to renew the Core Curriculum. While more radical students challenge the Core's Western bias, and seek dramatic changes, less disruptive reformers ought to consider the Beatles' case for inclusion. Quite clearly a Western band, with Western roots (occasionally bowing to George Harrison's Vedic influences), the Beatles deserve placement among the litany of greats studied within the Music Humanities curriculum. Their contribution to the Western musical tradition equals that of Bach and Wagner, and while the Beatles remain a relatively recent phenomenon, the Core's vitality depends upon continual calibration. The Beatles seem well suited to historicalinquiry in Music Humanities, which traces western music from its beginnings in the 12th and 13th centuries. Amid discussion of music's evolving structure and impact, the Beatles' redefinition of popular songform and popular culture would be both relevant and an appropriate coda for class study. But is there one particular Beatle work that could be situated easily in the curriculum? Is there one album or song representative of the band's innovation? The Beatles' corpus is so vast, and so distinguished that to pare seven years of recording down to one effort seems futile. With Sg t. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, though, we do have a critical work, a turning point for the band and for the genre with the same emotive and artistic power as Der Ring Des Niebelungen, or the Mass in B-minor. As history, Sgt. Pepper exists as an obscure metaphor for the adventurous, self-indul-gent, idealistic, and yet frightening, 19605. Just as the audience for their music became more aware of their world, and more willing to reformulate old assumptions of class, race, and sex, so did the Beatles create new aesthetic standards, perhaps reminiscent of Wagner's development of the music-drama. Sgt. Peppers howed that popular music could transcend the basic rhythm and blues format, and in the case of ""Within You Without You,"" depart from Western tradition altogether—no harmonic structure, no chords, just bizarre modulation. Simply put, as Derekjewell wrote in the Sunday Times after the album's release, ""There won't be much dancing done to Pepper. The Beatles are now producing performances, not music for frugging to."" Sgt. Pepper also cut short discussion that western, specifically British, culture had reached an inventive plateau. Without theheavy-handed political summaries available on solo tracks (""Give Peace a Chance,"" ""Ebony and Ivory""), the Beatles took British and American leaders to task not for their overt policies, but for their abandonment of essentially human attributes. In ""Fixing a Hole,"" Paul sings, ""See the people standing there who disagree and never win / And wonder why they don't get in my door."" This is not egotism, this is a defense of loneliness, or an affirmation of the individual as an important societal and political force. Although consideration of Sgt. Pepper as a whole overwhelms that of the album's component songs, ""A Day In the Life"" assumes individual distinction. Amid John's lamentations of bad news and faltering confidence in humanity, Ringo's complex rhythmic fills, and producer George Martin's effective bridging of modal shifts, ""A Day In TheLife"" becomes a startling achievement. The song's realism also speaks to the current popular malaise, ""Woke up, fell out of bed / Dragged a comb across my head / Found my way downstairs and drank a cup / And looking up I noticed I was late / Found my coat and grabbed my hat / Made the bus in seconds flat / Found my way upstairs and had a smoke / Somebody spoke and I went into a dream."" Music Humanities treats music as a completed project, an artform locked into the suppositions and forms of the past. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band —a Western record infused with Eastern mysticism and instrumentation —sets aside the belief that musical variation died with the invention of the phonograph. If the haphazard grafting of miscues and outtakes on ""Anthology 2"" proves anything, it is this. Our curriculum should acknowledge that achievement.""For Columbia, renewed interest in the Beatles provides a chance to renew the Core Curriculum.""119 th Editor In Chief Peter Freeman, CC '96, speaks from the Land of the Free on alternate Mondays in Spectrum."
305,Music Humanities,Music department celebrates 100-year anniversary,21 October 1996,"By STEPHANIE MEADE Spectator Staff WriterColumbia's music department celebrated its 100 th Anniversary last Saturday with a series of events throughout the weekend that focused on the department's rich history as well as its promising future. At Saturday night's finale concertin Miller Theater, Skyler Chapin, commissioner of New York City's Department of Cultural Affairs, read a proclamation prepared by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who proclaimed himself one of the department's many distinguished supporters. ""Columbia Music department has enriched the music life of our city. I . . . hereby proclaimSaturday, Oct. 19, 1996 in the city of New York as Columbia University Centennial Music Day,"" Chapin said, quoting Giuliani's proclamation. Saturday night's concert also featured highly acclaimed pianist and Columbia alumnus Russell Sherman, who accompanied the orchestra in the final piece,Beethoven's Concerto No. 5 for piano in E-flat. Professor of Music Walter Frisch said it was an honor to have Sherman, who graduated from Columbia in the late 1940s and has played with the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony, perform during the closing concert.""We're so proud that he'd come back and share this [event] with Columbia,"" Frisch said. Other events of the weekendlong celebration included Friday's showcase of student presentations, featuring graduate research topics and compositions as well as under-graduate performances. Saturday's symposium, ""Music After 2000,"" continued the celebration of the future, with a discussion by prominent musicians, writers, and composers such as Steve Reich. Following the symposium, Mary Monroe, curator of the exhibit, ""Music at Columbia: the First Hundred Years,"" in Low Rotunda, gave a gallery talk that highlighted the leading role of Edward MacDowell in the history of the music department here. MacDowell, ""the first interna-tionally recognized composer in the United States,"" founded the department and also created the Columbia University Orchestra. According to Frisch, MacDowell believed technical training and performance played an equally important role in education as music culture. MacDowell's ideas resulted in the current composition of the music department curriculum, which includes the Core course Music Humanities and courses in music history, theory, composition and ethnomusicology. ""It was a marvelous recapturingof these wonderful moments in the department's history,"" Professor of Music at State University of New York at Binghamton Alice Mitchell said. The combination of the past, present and future culminated in Saturday night's concert, which joined the three themes together in a celebration that reflected the music department's connection with the broader music community. ""The association of Columbia with music within America has really been part of our mission since the beginning,"" Frisch said."
306,Music Humanities,GS deans look to create core,2 April 1997,"By SABRINA ROJAS WEISS Spectator Staff WriterIn a town hall meeting School of General Studies (GS) Dean of Faculty Gillian Lindt, Assistant Dean Richard Braverman, and Dean of Students Rick Ferraro spoke about academic issues to approximately 20 students in Lewisohn Lounge last night . Lindt opened the meeting with asummary of the GS Committee on Instruction's (COI) work on formulating a core curriculum for the school. Lindt said students expressed concern at a meeting a year ago that the school's lack of classes such as those in the Columbia College Core left many GS students at a disadvantage. In most of the Columbia Collegehumanities courses, which GS students often take, the professors make references to information learned in Core classes such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities Lindt explained. Because GS enrollment in Core classes is strictly limited,Lindt said they often feel they are missing the foundations professors assume they have received during their tenure as a Columbia undergraduate. To remedy the situation, the COI has been considering the creation of a core compatible with the Columbia College Core. Braverman said plans are still very vague, however. ""[The GS core] would not be a substitute for Columbia Core classes, nor try to ape them,"" Braverman said. While still using the ColumbiaCollege Core as a model, Lindt said GS would try to give the classes a more multi-cultural perspective reflective of present-day academia. ""The Core classes are hallmarks of the time period in which they were developed,"" Lindt said. A GS core would also have to be compatible with the school's tradition of using distribution requirements that accept the credits of the school's many transfer students while at the same time providing a common foundation for all students, Braverman said. ""We need something that is not just ideologically driven but alsoworks for our students,"" Ferraro said. Lindt added that GS students can take Columbia College Core courses as electives if they give her a petition in writing and there are spaces available in the classes. According to Lindt, the COI has also been reviewing the math distribution requirement in response to student dissatisfaction. Lindt said the administration has been talking to the math department about making the Basic Math course a more valuable experience for students. ""The complaint I've heard at thelearning center about Basic Math is that it isn't taught, it's told,"" Bernie Lenahan, GS '97, said. To assist the GS night students who have been having trouble taking courses required for their majors, Lindt said most department chairs have agreed to a plan to increase the number of courses given at night. The plan would make all courses required for majors available at night, rotating over a period of three years and including summer sessions. In the case of the smaller departments, which might find it difficultto provide faculty for night courses, Lindt said they would be more flexible about course requirements. To solve the problem of GS students being closed out of chemistry classes, Lindt said the department has now made a commitment to hire adjunct professors if there are not enough graduate students to teach an adequate number of class sections. Lindt said any other difficulties GS students might have with being closed out of necessary classes can usually be remedied by giving one of the administrators a complaint in writing.At last night's GS town hall meeting, administrators discussed the idea of a core cirriculum for the school's students."
307,Music Humanities,Columbia College to enact new advising system,30 July 1997,"By DAVID KARP Spectator Summer BoardThe Class of 2001 is in many ways a class of firsts; it is the first class to have the lowest admit rate ever, it is the first official class of the new millennium, and it will be the first to experience the new system of academic advising developed by students and the administration last year after much debate and discussion. According to University Senator and Orientation Coordinator for Columbia College (CC) and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) Josh Ratner, CC '97, incoming first-years will have the opportunity to take advantage of an entirely new advising system. Class offerings will be posted on Columbia's World Wide Web site ""to acquaintpeople with the offerings available to CC students, ranging from academic information to career-related topics."" The Offices of the Deans of Columbia College, in conjunction with the Committee on Instruction (COI), developed the new advising system last year in response to widespread dissatisfaction among both students and faculty with the current advising system. Students will no longer be required to meet with a specific adviser during the first two years; instead, the new plan offers first-year students a virtual cornucopia of faculty members and administrators to provide guidance within their fields and areas of interest. Students will no longer have to meet with a faculty member or administrator to receive their PIN number or to have their programapproved. However, students will be assigned a dean or a member of the administration to facilitate contact with faculty members in a possible area of interest. The present practice of selecting an advisor within the field of one's major or concentration will be retained. In order to be successful, the new plan relies largely on a revised relationship between students and faculty, which presupposes that students will actively seek advice from the faculty, and that the faculty will readily provide it. ""Hopefully, [the new system] will be more productive and pro-active than before,"" Ratner said. ""Rather than providing students with a single advisor to help them adjust, the new advising system will try to establish mentoring relationships between students andprofessors."" While members of all classes will have to adjust to the new academic advising system, the Class of 2001 will be impacted the most. The role of academic mentor, originally shouldered upon often unwilling members of the faculty and administration, will now be shared by resident advisors (RA's) and student advisers in the initial weeks of orientation and the academic year. The Class of 2001 will be the first to be pre-registered for first semester classes. Entering students were asked to fill out a survey in which they expressed their areas of interest. All incoming students are registeredfor a section of literature humanities, logic and rhetoric, and either music humanities or an humanities. Students expressing interest in medicine are also pre-registered for a section of calculus and general chemistry. ""What's good about this system is that not only does [pre-registration] take some of the burden off the shoulders of incoming first years, but that they [incoming first years] are not bound to the sections for which they are pre-reg-istered,"" Ratner said. ""However, because all available sections are filled because of pre-registering, it makes it difficult to switch to a different section of a class if you don't like your teacher. Additionally, while athletic concerns are taken into account with pre-registration, work-study is not."" In addition to the system of pre-reg-istration, forums will be held during orientation to explain and clarify the language and science requirements. After pre-registration, students will have room for one to two additional classes, which they may use to fulfill additional requirements.""The new advising system puts a new emphasis on and demands a large commitment from the faculty. So far, they have supported the system and expressed a desire to participate in it,"" Ratner said. Students will also play a large mentoring role in the new advising system. Student advisors and RA's will be expected to and will be trained in disseminating academic advice. ""This new system provides lots of secondary sources [of information] but few, if any primary sources,"" Ratner said. ""Because student advisors in the past have not persisted in their involvement with students for longer than two to three weeks, they are not the focus for long-term academic advising. They are, however, primary players in first semester registration, along with the RA's."" Because of the dramatic nature of the changes to the advising system, student reaction thus far is mixed and largely consists of a ""wait and see"" mindset. ""Initially, we were taken aback by the dramatic nature of some of the proposed changes,"" Vice President ofColumbia College Student Council (CCSC) Colleen Mulleedy, CC '97, said. ""We were concerned that the new plan would lessen the quality of advising available to students. However, we worked closely with the deans of Columbia College and expressed our concerns to them. Most of our concerns were noted and the program was modified to account for them. I feel a lot less nervous now,"" she added. On the whole, the program is expected to evolve over time and open up new doors to students. The new system of academic advising also is aimed at exposure of the less popular majors. For example, Time magazine, among other sources, has rated Columbia's Italian Department one of the best in the nation, yet the department has very few people interested in majoring in it. ""The popular majors, such as English, political science, economics, and history, are popular because students want to major in them. One of the goals of the new system is to demonstrate and use some of Columbia's major resources in the smaller departments,"" Ratner said."

309,Music Humanities,University creates new section of Music Hum,5 February 1998,"By ALEXANDER EULE Spectator Staff WriterBecause of overcrowded classes, Music Humanities Chair lan Bent has created a new section of Music Hum and raised die class-size limit to 28 stuof a larger Columbia College class and an increase in the number of Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) students who opt to take Music Hum, according to Bent. Despite the additional section, Music Hum instructors say many classes are still overcrowded. Though the College usually limits Music Hum sections to 25 students, 10 Music Hum classes started out the semester with V) or more students, and the remaining sections all had rosters of 2S to 30, according to Bent. ""It is my impression that overcrowding i,s more of a problem thissemester,"" Bent said. ""The aim is to finish off at 25 fstudentsl"" The overcrowding is also the result of students signing up for multiple sections, Bent added. ""One of the problems is that some of the students have their names on four or five different class lists. They're trying to get added to any list they can,"" Bent said, explaining students' attempts to gain a spot in at least one of the classes they visit during shopping period. ""There must have been 36 students on the first day lof class},"" said James Currie, a Music Hum instructor. Currie has since cut his class to 28, removing unregistered students and giving priority to seniors and Juniors for any of the remaining spaces. Currie said he thinks the difference between 25 and 30 students is insignif-leant. ""In my opinion, after 20 people it's never going to be a discussion group,"" Currie said, adding that he does not mind teaching a larger class. Bent said Music Hum sections have been growing steadily over the last five years. ""The increase in College and SEAS [enrollment] has forced us to increase (the number of sections] by one section each semester for the last five years,"" he said. In those five years, the number of SEAS students taking Music Hum to fulfill their non-technical requirement has risen from 70 to 126 students, Bent said. The larger number of SEAS students choosing take Music Hum, coupled with a bigger College class, is responsible for the overcrowding and the creation ofnew sections, he said. In an attempt to avoid another problem in the early part of next semester, Bent said he already plans to offer 28 sections in the fall. David Annicchiarico, CC 'Ol, was turned away from the Music Hum. class for which he had been pre-registered since the fall, ""They had a computer problem, and they ended up over-registering,"" Annicchiarico said. ""The registrar was apologetic, but at that point they couldn't do anything about it."" Annicchiarico said the final decision on his situation rested with the instructor, but he had to give priority to upperclassmen. Ultimately, Annicchiarico was able to find another section. ""I just wish they had told me earlier,"" he said. ."
310,Music Humanities,"Music Department Sings the Blues Department is at 'breaking point,' chair says, citing overcrowding, understating",16 April 1998,"Department is at 'breaking point,' chair says, citing overcrowding, understatingBy SARAH ELZAS and SARAH GRAFMAN Spectator Contributing WritersMany students and faculty in Columbia's Music Department insist that instructor and classroom space shortages are putting the department in dire straits. ""The faculty is at a breaking point,"" Professor George Edwards, the chair of the Music Department, said. ""It is a small department, but it is also very complicated. The administrative load is high on the faculty."" Students complain of overcrowded classrooms, unchecked degradation of musical equipment, a ratio of professors to instructors that increasingly tilts toward the latter, and an increasing reliance on adjunct faculty to teach important courses. Many attribute the strain in the department to the University's recent policy of increasing the size of Columbia College, commonly known as 'Enhancement and Enlargement.' Under the policy, the school will expand by 15 percent by the year 2002, while investing in a variety of capital investments to maintain the quality of the school's education and living conditions. A ""Disturbing"" Situation ""My class of Classic and Romantic Music had over 100 students in it last semester,"" Music major Ken Thomson, CC '9B, said. ""That enhancement has not affected it is disturbing. If the administration has so much money, why don't we have new pianos? Why is the Music Performance program unable to give lessons to those who need it?""Although Enlargement and Enhancement may have a role in the straining of resources, what seems to be happening is actually an ongoing systemic problem within the department that dates back to the merging of Barnard and Columbia's Music Departments in 1989. ""Columbia is now responsible for Music and Visual Arts and Barnard has Dance and Drama,"" Professor Leeman Perkins said, who served as chair of the department from 1985 to 1990. ""But within a year of Barnard's eliminating its department, they redirected their faculty resources in other areas, but Columbia administration did not compensate in any way."" So while the new merged department had to serve most of Barnard's and all of Columbia's music students, staffing never increased to compensate. Many Barnard students have complained about the fact that all Barnard music majors have to take their courses in Columbia's department. One Barnard Music major, Eleanor Lipat, BC '9B, went so far as to say that there is no sense of community for musicians or music students at Barnard. ""How am I supposed to appreciate Barnard's resources as a Barnard student when I have to take all my classes across the street?"" she said. Sources of Frustration Columbia's department has lost eight faculty since 1989,and only three have been replaced. In 1994, they lost two professors to Harvard. ""That's not good for us, but of all places to go, might as well be Harvard,"" Edwards said. Staffing shortages are not likely to be resolved very quickly, because it usually takes a long time to replace faculty. ""The pattern now is when a line goes vacant in the department, it is at least one or two years before they are replaced,"" said Perkins. According to Edwards, the staff currently has 18.5 full time equivalents. There are three full time associate professors and three adjunct professors. Since 1989, there has been a 400 percent increase in Music majors, according to Thomas Payne, an associate professor and the coordinator of the department. As of this December, there were 48 Columbia College students who were either Music majors, concentrators, or pre-medical concentrators. There are also 39 Music students in Barnard and General Studies. One area where the department reports fewer problems is in the staffing of the Core Curriculum class Music Humanities. ""When we've asked for funding for extra sections, we got it within a number of days,"" Professor lan Bent,- chair of Music Humanities, said. Bent is recommending 28 sections of Music Hum for next fall to avoid the overcrowding of last semester. ""Arts and Sciences have been very cooperative,"" he added. Still, there a Q some remaining problems with staffing the course. ""The number of sections has gone up,"" Bent said, ""and the proportion of graduate student faculty has increased."" He reports an average ratio of 20 graduate students to seven professors teaching the course. David Cohen, vice president of Arts andSciences, helps determine the amount of sections created and the number of teachers hired. Although there is no way to determine exactly how many students will want to take Music Humanities in a given semester, Cohen explained how ""we plan in the prior year and determine the number of sections. We know how many new students will be coming in and the percentages of other students taking it. It's been an algorithm that has worked pretty well.""Cohen recognizes the complaints about the lack of faculty, but believes ""there are very few departments that will say 'we're OK.'"" He said that Arts and Sciences receive requests for new hires from departments who need full-time faculty, and also from departments who need more basic instructors. It is his job to listen to all requests and decide which departments deserve additional staffing slots. The job, he admits, can be difficult. ""Departments will express their priorities and we don't always pay attention to their needs."" However, as the percentage of instructors teaching Music Humanities sections has increased, many say that the course's quality has not declined. ""I think I see some very good teaching; I was quite humbled,"" Bent said of the graduate instructors. One of the basic precepts of Enlargement and Enhancement is that the administration is committed to protect the Core Curriculum.""The small class size restrictions on the Core will be maintained,"" reads the text of 'Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia,' published by the office of the Provost. Bent agreed, saying, 'The Humanities seem to be particularly well protected."" The department says that because the number of faculty needed to teach Music Humanities can not be decreased, other courses in the Music Department have suffered. ""The lack of professors undercuts our power to offer courses, especially electives,"" Bent said. The early edition of course listings for the coming fall semester indicates that the popular course ""Jazz,"" will not be offered. Countermeasures ""In 1993 there were 12 electives offered every year—six per semester. Now there are only five or six per year,"" said Edwards. There have been various solutions to maximize the use of instructors. ""Necessity being the mother of invention, we have found some interesting strategies,"" Perkins said. Adjunct professors, who are outside faculty that agree to teach at Columbia for limited time frames, are hired to teach classes that do not require very much time outside of the class, such as ear training. ""A quarter of the budget we have goes to the ear training coordinator,"" said Edwards. Although less expensive, hiring adjuncts has consequences. ""Hiring adjuncts shows little commitment on the part of CU and it puts into place professors who are very unsure of their job situation,"" said Payne. ""By replacing permanent professors, faculty morale and teaching quality go down."" This lack of stability frustrates many students. They cannot select courses based on professors, greatly reducing the opportunity to study with a teacher for more than onesemester. As Lipat said, ""It's always so unpredictable in terms of who will teach theory and ear training. It's always ['to be announced'] in the pencil book."" One solution to these course difficulties is combining graduate and undergraduate classes, called ""swing"" courses. Undergraduates get time alone with the professor before the combined lecture. ""This kind of class puts the department into an efficiency trap. It works in terms of faculty, but it is like a drug. Once you assume courses can be taught that way, it's hard to retract it,"" said Edwards. Another issue facing the Music Department is that of limited classroom space. Last year's renovation of Dodge Hall meant the loss of a room. Although in exchange the department was given another room, as Perkins said, ""having to trek over to Hamilton Hall is certainly not the ideal situation."" Also, there are no rooms in Dodge that can hold more than 60 students. However, some 2000 level courses have 100 or more students enrolled. Last fall, one section was offered on Saturday afternoon as an answer to this lack of space. However, according to Edwards, this response to overcrowding was clearly not a success. The class was not well attended. Another alternative is Friday classes, which has recently been a topic of great discussion throughout Columbia. Despite the problems plaguing it, the Music Department has many committed faculty members, and student interest in the Music major continues to grow. As Lerdhal said, ""In spite of everything, I think the Music Department's morale is pretty good. I would say the faculty is quite congenial now with itself. We all feel that we are growing now in all ways, but there are a lot of things that should be better.""In 1993 there were 12 electives offered every year—six per semester. Now there are only five or six per year. —Economic Chair George Edwards"
311,Music Humanities,the Core how does our core compare? the core over there...,28 September 1998,"how does our core compare?the core over there...By BECCA BURNS Spectator Staff WriterAt the center of every student's experience at Columbia College lie 18 semesters of shared, intensive liberal arts and sciences training better known as the Core Curriculum. Its goal, according to the College Bulletin, is to provide ""all Columbia students, regardless of their major or concentration, with wide-ranging perspectives on significant ideas and achievements in literature, philosophy, history, music, art, and science."" It seeks to attain this goal through an approach virtually no other American universities take: a relatively long sequence of courses broken down into small sections and required of every single student enrolled in the school. These are Columbia's famous Hums.Columbia's core is like no other. In comparison to other universities notorious for their extensive undergraduate requirements, Columbia's core is two semesters worth of courses longer than the University of Chicago's, eight and a half semesters longer than Stanford's, and ten semesters longer than Harvard's. Of course that says nothing of schools noted for their lack of required core courses, such as Brown, which requires zero courses to Columbia's 18. Even compared to colleges with larger general requirements, Columbia is the only traditional liberal arts program to require specific courses, aside from freshman composition, on top of a broad base of distribution requirements. These required courses, the Hums, are perhaps the most idealistic part of the core, aiming to expand both students' and instructors' abilities to think and argue critically, write lucidly, and to promote a community of ideas which extends outside the classroom into students' everyday conversations. These .pedagogical ideals present problems, however: how is the College to provide small enough sections to allow for the kind of discussion it believes fosters these goals? How can it schedule the entire freshman class into these small sections without exceeding the cap? How to gather enough qualified instructors for the number of sections needed? How can these courses keep the attention of a group of students with such diverse interests? In short, does the core accomplish what it sets out to do? Surprisingly, it does. According to Cathy Popkin, chair of Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), small class size is one of the keys to the success of the Core. ""Even in following the same syllabus as every other section, each section develops its own agenda,"" Popkin says. ""Because the classes are small and students stay together for a year, it becomes a joint project to make sense of these texts. Discussions are real, not canned."" Administrative Director of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly agrees. She notes that for the last couple of years the student to teacher ratio in Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization (CC) has been around 21:1. The sections are capped at 22, although occasionally, if a particular time period is in great demand, the numbers may rise to 23 or 24 students, but never more than that. ""The emphasis of these courses is on critical thinking, argumentation, and learning how to ask questions—things that come best working with peers in small groups,"" Gillooly said. Lan Bent, chair of Music Humanities, noted that when a section grows beyond 30 students it ceases to be a class discussion and becomes a lecture. According to Bent, the Music Hum program has worked very hard in the past several years to bring section sizes down, a task made more difficult with the growing number of College and General Studies students and the cuts to the music department's faculty and resources. ""In the past the sections have been as large as 32 or 33 students,"" Bent said. ""This year's absolute limit is 26. We've also increased the number of sections from 25 last year to 28 this year, mirroring the increase in enrollment."" The increase in section numbers obviously necessitates an increase in the number of instructors as well, but not all of these vacancies are filled by full-time faculty. Rather, the departments hire PhD candidates with all but their dissertations completed (ABDs) to teach many of the core sections. This semester, of the 55 Lit Hum instructors 27 are full-time faculty, 6 are Fellows, and 22 are ABDs. CC sections have a similar breakdown: 20 full-time faculty, 7 Fellows and 26 ABDs. Music Hum instructors are mainly grad students, who outweigh full-time faculty three to one. Does this indicate a decrease in quality of instruction for certain sections? 'To be completely honest, there is no difference between the level of instruction by PhD [candidates] and full-time faculty,"" Popkin says. ""People have this idea about sec-ond-rate grad students —it's not true."" Popkin notes several advantages that PhD candidates have over full-time professors. Because they only teach one section of the Core classes, they put all of their energy into teaching that section. Graduate student preceptors also have an extensive support network, with weekly seminars and discussions on the texts taught in their courses. . Gillooly adds that graduate student preceptors go through a rigorous selection process, and those chosen generally out-perform other grad students in their departments. ""They're very good teachers and they have the chance to show that here,"" he says. If the graduate student preceptors are the ""best of the best,"" as Popkin calls them, what about the full-time professors who teach core classes? Selected on a volunteer basisStanford University of Chicago 3 quarter sequence in the area of ""Cultures, 4 quarters of Humanities Ideas, and Values g q uar t er sequence of Civilizations 3 courses in the fields of Natural 2 quarters of Math Science, Applied Science, Technology, 6 quarters of Natura| Scjence and Math 3 quarters of Social Science 3 courses of humanities and Sequence Social Science 310 4 q Uar t e rs of foreign lan--2 of 3 sub-areas of World g uage Cultures, American 3 q Uar t ers 0 f physical Cultures, and Gender education Studies Harvard 8 of 10 course categories: 1.

Social Analysisfrom a wide variety of departments, none of the professors who teach the core are experts on the subject matter of the courses. When coupled with other teaching obligations and university commitments, the time they spend on preparation for their core classes can be limited. Whether or not this is reflected in the quality of their teaching is subject to debate. Wayne Proudfoot, professor of Religion, who has taught CC ten times during his years at Columbia, notes that his commitment to teaching thecore was as great as any of the courses he teaches within his field of expertise. ""I spent a lot of time on my CC section, more than on most other classes."" Proudfoot said. According to Professor of Classics Suzanne Said, who taught Lit Hum for the last 4 years, preparation for material outside her specialty is completely different than for classes she teaches in her department. ""You spend more time on what you don't know well,"" Said says.Kathy Eden, Professor of English and Comparative literature, has taught Lit Hum ""every chance [she's] gotten"" and looks at it as a unique and exciting teaching experience. 'Teaching a course in your expertise, you're very much in isolation,"" Eden says. 'Teaching Lit Hum, there is a kind of community of faculty and students, and the ways of teaching the texts are constantly evolving. Those are the richest teaching experiences for me. There is nothing else that compares to it."" Of course, the excitement of developing an intellectual community depends not only on enthusiastic instructors and small sections, but requires the involvement of the students as well. Instructors recognize the importance of this in the reasons they list for teaching core courses. Bent, who has taught Music Hum for 12 years, notes that ""teaching core courses, you can have a much bigger impact in bringing music to people."" Said mentions that the opportunity to reach students outside of her field was a major incentive for teaching Lit Hum for her. ""You have students for whom the material is quite fresh, and they react immediately to it,"" she explains. But do students, whose interests vary widely and often do not center on literature, philosophy, music or art, really have the same positive reaction to their core courses as their instructors? They seem to. ""The Core Curriculum was one of the reasons why I came to Columbia because 1 was interested in doing a double degree in natural and social sciences,"" says Shampa Bari, CC 'Ol. ""The Core Curriculum is a good basis from which to start."" Other students, while appreciating the Core, see its length and intensity as a sort of academic tough love. ""It does limit you in a sense, but it forces you to study things that you would not study for leisure,"" notes Katie Ng, CC 'O2. U I need to be forced."" In response to the notion that the core humanities courses are a good basis from which Columbia students can formulate interesting conversation at cocktail parties, Professor lan Bent calls upon the common sense of those who apply to Columbia. ""Why come to the most recognized core-based college in the country if that were true?"" Bent asks. The core is one of the best known and established parts of Columbia."" ""If you've graduated from Columbia you share a certain kind of educational experience that we as an institution endorse,"" Gillooly agrees. ""In the Core, knowledge is not just injecting one person's thoughts into another, but rather ideas are born. It's the combination of minds together."" —Additional reporting by Christian Kaufholz"
312,Music Humanities,Registration For Art Hum Causes Jam,2 February 1999,"By DANIEL FELDMAN and ANDREW FORREST Spectator Staff Writer and Spectator Junior Staff WriterThe Art Humanities Office has been underestimating the number of Art Hum sections needed over the past four years, causing a registration logjam for the course, according to officials in the Art Hum Office. Professor Barry Bergdoll, director of the Art Humanities program, said the problem was unforeseeable, even though the first-year College class has increased from 838 to 956 since 1994 and the Art Hum Office has only added one more section over that period. During that time the official cap on Art Hum classes has remained at 24 students, making it difficult for students to register for, or switch, Art Hum sections. Other Core classes have added sections as the undergraduate class size has grown; Literature Humanities and Music Humanities each added three more sections in the past five years, and Contemporary Civilization has increased from 46 to 54 sections in that period. ""What we have done in the College and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to address the needs of students as we have progressed through Enlargement and Enhancement is to try to accomodate student demands,"" said Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis. ""I think we have been rather successful,"" she said. Art Hum instructors, however, think otherwise. ""It presents a real challenge to teach this course when there are 30 students in a class,"" Art Hum instructor Lynn Catterson said. Catterson's two sections of Art Hum have 29 and 25 students. ""They want Art Hum to be interactive, and it is challenging with a class of this size,"" Catterson said.""It makes field trips difficult if the instructor is short,"" she added. Yatrakis 'said enrollment in Music Hum and Art Hum classes can be difficult to predict since students may take them at any point in their Columbia careers. ""According to our calculations we add sections as needed,"" Yatrakis said. However, as the College has encouraged students to complete the Core during their first two years, the number of students in each Core section has steadily risen. Using a formula of dividing the total number of first-years by the number of Art Hum sections per semester, it is clear that the ratio of students to sections has increased significantly. In Fall 1994 there were 29 College students for every Art Hum section. This semester that number stands at 32 and including SEAS students the number has gone from 38 to 42 students per section since 1994. Since first-year students are now preregistered for Art Hum and Music Hum, as few as two spots per section remain for upper-class students to fill in classes where the cap is 24 students. Every Art Hum section this semester is full, and every one but those offered at nine a.m. are over the cap. The number of students per class peaked in the 1996-97 academic year, when 975 College first-years squeezed into 29 Art Hum classes, 55 Lit Hum sections, and 25 Music Hum sections. The following year, the College Class of 'Ol fell to 961, and two Music Hum sections and four Lit Hum sections were added. In 1997-98, SEAS reached a peak number of first-years, with 316. Last week, the Art Hum Office stopped students from registeringfor Art Hum so its staff could catch up with all the changes in enrollment that had been taking place since the start of the semester. The registration freeze was the result of an overload which occurred when an unexpected influx of students, who had not registered for Art Hum during early registration in November attempted to sign up for the course two weeks ago, according to Bergdoll. ""We weren't oversubscribed until the first day of class,"" Bergdoll said. ""Now it's hard to fix anything because we're already in the middle of the mess."" As a result of the increase in Art Hum enrollment, many sections exceeded their cap of 24 students per class. The Art Hum Office then told Art Hum instructors to freeze changes in their rosters and submit a final, uncapped roster at the end of last week.Bergdoll said the shuffling led to incorrect rosters and glitches in the automatic registration system. ""The problem is the chaos of people moving back and forth between sections,"" he said. ""It's an extremely imperfect system."" One problem is that many students retain spots in Core classes even after they plan to stop attending, according to Deputy Registrar John Carter. ""It's a concession to people who don't drop the course on time,"" he said, noting that shopping and Core classes can only coexist ""in a limited fashion."" ""I hate to reward the bullies and punish the pious, but we'll do it if that's convenient for students,"" Carter said. In Sept. 1998, the entering classes of both CC and SEAS leveled off from previous years' increases, at 956 and 299 students respectively.Core classes, such as this Lit Hum section, have grown in size since 1994."
313,Music Humanities,Students Await Opening of Lerner,28 April 1999,"By DANIEL FELDMAN Spectator Staff WriterIn a year marked by a host of changes to student services that have made improving undergraduate life the touchstone of the College's expansion program, one transition dominated the attention of administrators, student councils, and activities planners over the last semester: the preparation for the opening of Alfred Lerner Hall this fall. The opening of the $B5 million student center in August— only the basement bookstore has opened this year— signals the most significant addition to the Morningside campus in years. Administrators and students alike have said they hope the much-anticipated center will be the catalyst for bringing a sense of community to the College. Still, the planning stage has incited controversy among the parties involved in the planning of key elements. Students have accused administrators of excluding them from major decisions like the presence of the School of General Studies (GS) in the building, and in response administrators have been replying that students are distorting the issues. ""While there may be some students who feel that they've been rubber stamping,"" said Dean of Student Affairs Chris Colombo, who completed his first full year in his post, ""everything we've heard from students we are considering and taking very seriously."" In numerous discussions that began on Mar. 5, administrators and representatives of the College and Engineering student councils and club funding boards have discussed and debated issues surrounding the new student center as general as what schools and clubs should have access to, and as detailed as how to furnish the new Office of Student Activities and Development (OSA). Students and administrators clashed most often over possible new structures for the Activities office. Students feared that the proposed programming body would duplicate some of the event planning roles that students have undertaken in the past. The OSA staff proved to beanother steadfast issue as administrators refused to change their plan of conducting job searches for all of the activities officer positions, each of which has been filled by personnel working under one-year contracts that will expire this June. In recent weeks, the staff issue has come to the forefront as students circulated petitions requesting that Colombo, who has authority over the OSA rehire the current staff members. Throughout the process Colombo maintained that it would be unfair to discuss specific individuals until later. ""As far as we know, everyone on the activities and affairs staff is happy with the opportunities they've been afforded,"" he said. Student group leaders, however, vocally expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of information over the last few weeks, and the growing possibility that OSA management including Director Wayne Blair would leave Columbia by the fall. ""There's been a breakdown in communication completely,"" Samri Mesrour, CC 'OO and president of Columbia Concerts said last week as part of a poll of group leaders who resoundingly supported the rehiring of the current OSA staff. 'There's going to be a decision made this fall behind closed doors and that will be it,"" she added. Students said they were upset by what they perceived as a lack of student input during crucial final stages of planning for Lerner. The student center has been under development since 1991, when renovation plans were first considered for Ferris Booth Hall, the old student center that stood on Lerner's site until 1996. Students leaders said they had not been contacted about crucial issues such as the move of the Office of Student Affairs into Lerner, the allocation of space for student governance bodies, and the levying of a new ""Lerner Hall fee"" that will maintain the student center's upkeep. The fee will reportedly begin this fall at approximately $6O for College, Engineering, GS, and Barnard students, and $3O for graduate students.Construction on the building, though, proceeded ahead of schedule without student input. The cinema and some of the eating areas have been given a higher priority on the development list and are now due to open earlier next year than previously planned. Clubs and offices will begin moving into the building soon after commencement, Lerner officials have said, though the Class of 2003 will be the first to use the building when it opens before orientation in August. This academic year also saw the beginning of construction on the $5O million Broadway Residence Hall, scheduled to make its 373 beds available for next year's housing lottery. Students will see the building at its full height when they return in the fall and exterior work will be finished by the turn of the year, URH director Ross Fraser said. As part of this year's $1.3 million investment in ""student quality enhancement,"" which makes up one third of the University's Enlargement and Enhancement plan, the Broadway dorm is aimed at complementing Lerner Hall in improving undergraduate life. This projected sum is due to nearly double next year, along with non-acade-mic expansion spending, increasing from $4.2 million to $9.1, and academic spending, rising from $lOO,OOO to $1 million, according to University records. The dozens of changes to the physical plant included the opening of the Milstein Library and renovation of the ground floor of Butler Library. This past fall's uncovering of artwork in Butler's entryway, which was transformed into a lap-top-friendly coffee bar, was part of the $7O million overhaul of Butler library. The project, library officials said, will be finished with the completion of construction to the main graduate reading room, and a new circulation and reference desk on the third floor for the fall. Changes in student services this year also included the implementation of the Columbia Card, which can be used as an ATM card for students who have Citibank bank accounts. Additionally, on-line registration services expanded and Barnard launched a revamped website, including experiments with online course signups. Columbia registration was changed to a class-tiered system, and this fall administrators say changes could be in store again for registration for Art and Music Humanities classes, as the College attempts to make Core registration more streamlined. Following last year's classroom space audit by the Morningside Classroom Committee, administrators say they might move for an earlier drop date of classes, as well as move toward what they call a better use of classrooms sometime next year. Several classrooms, including Altschul Auditorium and 808 Mudd —a hi-tech classroom —are slated for development during next year as well, administrators said. They also said that several Hamilton Hall administrative offices, including the Core office and the College Budget office, might soon move to Lion's Court, which remain until renovation of those Hamilton offices is completed.Administrators hope that Alfred Lerner Hall will offer students a centralized social gathering setting."

315,Music Humanities,Hamilton to House New Core Office,14 October 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN Spectator Associate News EditorAs part of the planned renovation of Hamilton Hall's classrooms and entrance area, which is scheduled to begin within the next year, the University is constructing a new Core office that will serve as an administrative center and home of the new Director of the Core, College representatives said. The Core office, which will be located where the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is currently housed in 212 Hamilton, will become a physical center for the Core Curriculum where students,preceptors, and professors will be able to gather for social and intellectual purposes. The office will handle administrative actions, such as section changes for all Core classes, including Contemporary Civilization as well as Literature, Music, and Art Humanities. It will also house the Science and Major Cultures administrators to the Core, according to Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis. The new office will also serve as the administrative base for African Civilization classes, Yatrakis said, because there is currently nodepartment under which these Major-Cultures classes fall. Yatrakis said that the director of the Core position is a further development of the administrator of the Core position, which is currently filled by Eileen Gillooly. As administrator of the Core, Gillooly manages students' requests to change their Core sections, develops the class lists for Music and Art Humanities, and attempts to integrate the different aspects of the Core. Gillooly said that the new position does not add any duties to the current one. She will move into the position of director when the renovations are completed. The creation of the office is meant to unify all aspects of the Core, since many students consider the Humanities courses as separate from the Science and Major Cultures classes, Yatrakis said. ""We are seeing the office as a center for the teaching of, and the learning of the Core,"" she said. Yatrakis added that the committees on Science and Major Cultures will meet in the new office, and that all administrative actions associated with them, along with the humanities courses, will be centralized and overseen by the director. The office will be essential in the continuing integration of Major Cultures classes into the Core, Gillooly said. The office will ""facilitate interac-tion between various parts of the Core to Major Cultures to give it more support, and to greater integrate it into the Core,"" she said. Gillooly also said that the office would provide greater interdepartmental communication and encourage direct relationships between Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, and Art and Music Humanities. ""There is an idea that Lit Hum does in fact lead into CC, and that those two courses are highly connected with Music and Art,"" Gilooly said. Gillooly envisions an office where a student, inspired by his or her Literature Humanities class, will be able to research the connection of a particular book with a piece of music or a work of art that was produced in the same period, she said. Yatrakis said the office comes as part of recent growing support for the Core. She said a greater number of professors and graduate students express interest in teaching Core classes than ever before, and that there is a greater commitment to the pedagogy of those graduate students. The entire renovation of Hamilton will be ""a celebration of the Core,"" Yatrakis said. ""The office will give the Core a sense of place."" With the new office, a full-time administrative assistant will be hired to assist the Director position —it is the first such assistant to be hired in the College's history, Gillooly said. Yatrakis added that in the past, a single graduate student was responsible for all administrative aspects of the Core. Gillooly said that the decision to build a new office is one of manyrecent administrative changes to the Core. She said this was the first fall semester in which first-years were able to change their Literature Humanities sections via telephone. This policy was implemented in the spring and was made permanent this semester, she said. Gillooly also said that her office moved the deadline for changing sections via phone from October 17, which was the final date to add a non-Core class, to October 13. Gillooly noted that the move was ""a compromise between a desire to have a shopping period and credit the importance of not getting behind in Core classes."" In addition to the Director's office, there will be a seminar room, used for weekly meetings between graduate teachers of the Core and professors, as well as for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization staff meetings, Gilooly said. She wants the seminar room to have the ability to serve as a technologically advanced classroom. In addition, there may be a library as well as a separate area that would house computers. Yatrakis said that there is an ""outside time"" of two years for completion of the office. In December, architectural plans for the renovations of Hamilton will be submitted for approval, at which point the College will create a final blueprint for the new office. Construction will begin in May and be primarily completed during the summers. The goal for the completion of the renovation is the 2001-02 academic year, Yatrakis said. Facilities managers have said that Lion's Court will be used as a home for construction workers until the Hamilton renovation project is completed.Future Director of the Core Eileen Gillooly and her associates will be moved to a new office Hamilton."
316,Music Humanities,Hamilton Facelift Set for This Summer,8 November 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN Spectator Associate News EditorAs the crown jewel of the University's $l3 million plan to improve classrooms across the campus, Hamilton Hall will undergo a major renovation beginning this summer that is expected to last about a year. The renovation is an attempt to create a symbolic center to include a new Core Office, new offices for College deans, and upgraded classroom spaces, according to Dean of the College Austin Quigley. Hamilton, which was the central location for the 1968 riots, as well as the 1993 Ethnic Studies SPEaK-in, is the College's flagship classroom building. The construction will renovate the building's classrooms and its lobby area, and create a new Core Office that will be housed where theAdmissions Office is currently located. All of Hamilton's nearly 40 classrooms will receive new furnishings and lighting and be made technologically ""up-to-date,"" Quigley said. Quigley said the lobby will be restored in order to recover thegrandeur of the original McKim, Mead, and White architectural plan. The lobby will be converted into a display area, ""which captures something of the history of the College and some of the most prominentteachers who taught in College classes, particularly as they relate to the Core curriculum,"" according to Quigley. The lobby will accommodate the changes made to the offices. The new Core Office will be located in 212 Hamilton, where the current Admissions Office is. The Admissions Office will then move to the other side of the lobby. The Center for Ethnicity and Race Office will remain in its current location on the fourth floor. Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said the new Core Office will become a physical center for the Core Curriculum that will provide teaching assistance to current Core teachers and a library for students and teachers to do research. Quigley added that the office would also increase the level of teaching in the Core. ""One of the things we need to be doing with the Core is upgrading the quality of teaching it,"" he said. The Core Office will function ""as a center where we bring together all the teachers of the Core so they continue and better their attitude and teaching of the Core,"" Quigley said. The library will include all books related to Core courses as well as books that discuss general education at other academic institutions. Quigley said the library will include teacher notes from past Core sections that will enable current teachers to improve their courses. Yatrakis and Quigley said the office would also house computerstations that should allow students and teachers to do electronic research, especially regarding inter-Core classes such as Literature and Music Humanities. The renovation is an important step in the move to make the College the center of the University and to give it its own symbolic center, Quigley said. Quigley said the most obvious symbolic space for the College is around Hamilton and South Field. Last year was the first time all firstyears were housed around South Field, when the decision was made to move first-years from Schapiro to Hartley and Wallach Halls. The first step to enhance this symbolic area was the renovation of Van Am Quad in the early '9os, when its pavement was re-laid and new trees and grass were planted. Renovations to Butler Library signify administrators' attempts to make the library have more of an undergraduate feel, Quigley said. The wrought-iron gate, currently placed just west of the Hamilton entrance, was the original entrance to the 19th Columbia campus located in midtown before its move to Morningside Heights. The University retained the gate with the intention of holding onto to some of the historical identity of the College. Quigley said the gate would most likely be moved to the pathway between Lion's Court and the Hamilton lawn when Lion's Court is removed, so as to be in a more prominent location and serve as a more obvious entrance to the Hamilton, Van Am Quad area."
317,Music Humanities,Student Bands and Musicians Complain About Lack of Practice Space on Campus,8 November 1999,"By RACHEL GERSHMAN Spectator Staff WriterIn July, Samantha Unger, BC 'Ol, president of Columbia Music Presents (CMP), which represents student bands and musicians, was told that bands would be given practice space in Lerner Hall. Unger and CMP requested at least 16 hours a week of access to practice space; however, in August they were told they would only be allocated four hours per week. The campus musicians decided to give up the practice space because, as Unger explained, there were ""too many bands and too many people"" for anyone to use the space in such a short period of time effectively. CMP is only one group among many student musicians on campus for whom the University does not provide enough space to practice. Practice rooms used to be available to students in Schapiro and in Mudd. However, ""Somebody decided that no drums were allowed in Schapiro,"" Unger said . Also, the practice room in Mudd became a classroom and is no longer available to musicians. ""No drums were allowed to be played on campus,"" Unger added. As a result of being forced to wait until additional space was found, a group of campus musicians met outside Lerner on Oct. 15 to let the administration know that these bands could not function without places to practice. ""Band members didn't want to wait anymore,"" Unger said. She said that they were ""standing up for student rights."" Now a storage room in Lerner has become a temporary practice space that is open the same hours as the rest of the building. Bands can sign up on a weekly basis to practice there,but they are also sharing this room with the orchestra. CMP is pushing for this room in Lerner to be open 24 hours a day. According to Unger, CMP would be willing to pay to soundproof a room if necessary. In addition to more practice rooms, campus bands wish to get payed when they play for school functions. Unger explained that the Columbia College Student Council (CCSC) is currently working toward making these two requests-getting practice rooms and pay-possible because they are affecting a good percentage of students. Travis Harrison, CC 'Ol, a drummer for the Lost Beat Heroes, has been inconvenienced by the lack of practice space. Harrison described the Lost Beat Heroes as a ""serious working band,"" which plays often. ""We practice a lot,"" he said, explaining that without access to rehearsal space, it is difficult to prepare for a show. He explained that last year, when the rooms in Mudd and Shapiro were available, ""there was never really a problem."" But when these practice rooms were closed, the situation changed. ""We immediately went into panic mode,"" Harrison said. ""I was forced to go into the Woodbridge basement."" He added that the loud music bothered Woodbridge residents and security came to stop Harrison and the others from playing. ""I felt like playing music was becoming a crime,"" he said. He added, however, ""I'm going to play no matter what and I'm not going to pay $3O to go to a rehearsal studio."" Harrison and the Lost Beat Heroes are forced to commute to Nassau to the house of one of the band members to practice.""Music facilities are horrible,"" said Russell Sticklor, CC 'O3. ""They are really nonexistent."" He added, ""Students have no place to play on campus."" Sticklor and his friends get together once in a while to play, but are forced to play in his room. ""We have had to move a drum set into my room,"" he said, adding that this lack of space is ""very, very, very frustrating."" Student musicians not affiliated with CMP also find it difficult to practice. ""I'm in a chamber music group that counts as a class, yet we have nowhere to practice,"" said Morika Tsujimura, CC 'O3. She said the practice rooms in Schapiro are ""not accessible."" ""You can't go whenever you want,"" she said. ""If they are full you can't practice."" ""[There are] many opportunities to play, but we have no place to practice,"" Tsujimura said, explaining that her chamber music group is invited to play for Music Humanities. ""We don't know how good we're going to be [without practicing],"" she said. Unger explained that CMP was created because there was ""no voice for students who weren't in orchestra, or wind ensemble or jazz band."" A group of students who are not part of a specific club find it difficult to express their opinions. Last year, 30 shows were organized through CMP, both on campus and throughout the city. CMP offers many services to student musicians, including marketing assistance and internship opportunities.Aron Wahl, CC '00, and Andrew Wan, CC '01, practice the piano in the basement of River.

318,Music Humanities,Core Remains Prize Jewel In Columbia's Crown,22 November 1999,"By CHARLES LANDOW Spectator Staff WriterIn an era of change, with construction dotting the campus, entering classes expanding, and departments moving to accommodate more students, Columbia College has remained steadfast in its insistence that every student complete the Core Curriculum. Even though some departments are making do with fewer profes-sors than they have had in the past, courses in the Core have remained small and, according to many of the instructors who teach them, relatively problem-free. ""It has never been better taken care of,"" J & G Siegel Professor of the Humanities Cathy Popkin said about the Core. Popkin, who also teaches in the Department of Slavic Languages, is the chair of Literature Humanities (Lit Hum). Eileen Gillooly, who as director of the Core manages all of its administrative aspects, agreed withPopkin. Despite growing College enrollment, the Core has maintained its small classes and will keep them, she said. ""With these kinds of pressures that the College is under, a lot of attention is being paid to the Core, so I'm not actually worried."" Interviews with 20 instructors of Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization (CC) revealed that, while individual departments may have their problems, most regard Lit Hum and CC as oases, sanctuaries from larger lecture classes. And their students agree. Nathania Nisonson, CC 'O3, said her Lit Hum class was ""a perfect size."" She said her teacher, a senior professor, often lets students lead the discussion. ""It's very good because it's not the professor talking the whole time,"" she said. Core administrators also spoke about closer integration of Lit Hum and CC with the Major Cultures, Art, and Music Humanities courses that comprise the rest of the Core.Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that integration would be enhanced by the creation of a Core office, planned to open in the lobby of Hamilton Hall in the next few years. The current health of the Core has come about despite claims of understaffing by history and English professors in their departments. Each department is obliged to staff a certain number of sections in the Core, with English and History contributing the most professors to Lit Hum and CC classes, respectively. These obligations, which have been increasing due to an enlarged enrollment in the College, are putting a strain on course offerings for majors in those departments but at the same time are maintaining the health of the Core. Still, there are two main concerns with the Core's continued strength: the size of sections and the percentage of senior faculty teaching them. Yatrakis said that the desired enrollment for each Lit Hum and CC section is 22. This year's average enrollment in Lit Hum courses is 20.5, and 21.4 in CC courses. Most of the instructors interviewed thought the size of theirclasses was appropriate. Professor of Classics Eleanor Dickey, whose CC section has an enrollment of 21 students, said, ""The size seems ideal, actually. I normally prefer small classes, but in CC a smaller class would make discussion harder —you need some diversity of opinion to get a good discussion."" Besides class sizes, another issue of discussion about the Core has been the ratio of senior tenured professors to junior nontenured professors and graduate student preceptors. Yatrakis said the University's goal is to have Lit Hum and CC sections taught by one-third senior faculty, one-third junior faculty, and one-third preceptors. Yatrakis said that even if the College wereable to fill each Core section with a senior faculty member, they would instead maintain the stated goal in an effort to have a ""multi-gen-erational"" staff of Core teachers. Some students have said they would prefer being taught by a senior faculty member, and some senior professors have said the level of the University's dedication to the Core is shown by the percentage of senior professors teaching Core classes. Others, though, say that senior professors are not necessarily better teachers than junior faculty or preceptors. Justin Marks, CC 'O2, who has a preceptor for CC, said about his instructor, ""I don't have any qualms about his status [as a preceptor], because he's so knowledgeable."" Of the 50 sections of CC offeredthis semester, 10 (20 percent) are taught by senior professors, 18 (36 percent) by junior faculty, 19 (38 percent) by graduate preceptors, and one by a part-time administrator in the Office of Alumni Relations. Of 55 Lit Hum sections, 12 (22 percent) are taught by senior faculty, 22 by junior faculty (40 percent), and 20 by preceptors (36 percent). (Attempts by the Spectator to find the teachers of the remaining two CC sections and one Lit Hum class were unsuccessful.) Not everyone is convinced, however, that more senior faculty would improve the quality of the Core. Popkin, the Lit Hum chair, called the preceptors who teach the Core ""the cream of the cream of the cream of the graduate student crop. They are so smart it's terrifying,"" she said. ""I don't think the program would be served by reducing the number of preceptors. I think they breathe life into the program."" Professor of Political Science Douglas Chalmers, who teaches CC, said, ""I think graduate students are often better teachers than professors. I don't think the ratio is a problem. I think they ought to continue to urge seniors to teach, but it isn't a crisis."" Bonnie Kent, a religion professor who also teaches a section of CC, said that senior professors have more experience than preceptors, but added that graduate students are apt to pay more attention to their sections. For a preceptor, Kent said, a Core class is ""like your first child. ""If your section coughs twice orlooks frightful, you panic. That level of attention fades with age,"" Kent said. Though the ratio is not now cause for concern, some instructors still said that more senior faculty should give the Core a try. Professor of Islamic History Richard Bulliet said, ""As I see it, what other university would allow their professor of Islamic history to conduct a class on Plato, St. Augustine, Michelangelo, and Virginia Woolf?"" Bulliet currently teaches a section of Lit Hum and has taught CC and Art Humanities in the past. The interviewed professors said the main reason few tenured professors teach the Core is that there are far fewer incentives for them to do so than there are for younger instructors. Dean of the College Austin Quigley said that the College has created a set of endowed chairs that would give senior faculty a monetary incentive to teach the Core.Quigley said that the chairs are given to faculty members, selected by their peers, for five years. In a speech given at the Hamilton Awards last Wednesday evening, Quigley said three new chairs had recently been established, and that two are about to be established."
319,Music Humanities,CU Purchases New Steinways,26 January 2000,"By MATTHEW FOX Columbia Daily Spectator■ Music Department and URH spend $250,000 to replace pianos in disrepair.In a serious effort to improve classroom and rehearsal conditions at Columbia, the MusicDepartment and University Residence Halls (URH), with the support of Arts and Sciences, purchased a quarter of a million dollars worth of Steinway pianos to beplaced at various locations around the campus. Until recently, many of the school's existing pianos were in disrepair. The instruments were missing legs or out of tune. With 29 sections of Music Humanities meeting this semester and an additional 243 students involved in various music programs, new pianos have been a University priority ever since an academic review committee pointed out the deteriorating condition of campus pianos. Some music majors have confirmed the committee's report. Lauren Porsch, BC 'Ol, said, ""the older pianos in the music building had technical problems, keys would stick, they were out of tune, and the sound quality wasn't terrific."" One prospective music major was forced to ""purchase a digital[keyboard] because the condition of the pianos was so bad."" Administrators hope the new instruments will go a long way in improving students' musical experience. In addition to having ""an immediate positive impact on student rehearsal, practice, concert, and classroom experiences,"" the purchase of 19 new pianos demonstrates a deliberate move by the administration to ""improve musical life on campus,"" Music Department Chair Elaine Sisman said. Sisman said that if the Music Department had purchased the pianos at list price, the total cost would have exceeded $419,000. The final cost was reduced, however, because the University traded in old pianos, while also receiving a large institutional discount. Sisman said Steinway does not allow Columbia to publicize the size of the discount.Of the 19 pianos purchased, five are Steinway ""B"" Grands, while the other 14 are a combination of Boston baby grands and uprights. According to Sisman, the Steinway Grands list for $52,800 each. She added, ""Boston pianos are made by Steinway to their exacting specifications and are excellent and durable pianos."" The Music Department purchased 16 of the pianos, splitting the cost of the fifth Steinway Grand with the Chaplain and Provost. URH purchased the other two. Five pianos will be located in classrooms, one in Hamilton, and four in Dodge. Six will go to practice rooms, three of which will be in the new Broadway dorm. The remaining pianos will be housed in a Lerner Hall rehearsal room, four dorm lounges, two in performance spaces in Philosophy and the chapel, and one in an office for auditions.SPECTATOR/ANDREW WAN This baby grand piano is one of 19 pianos recently purchased by the Music Department and University Residence Halls."
320,Music Humanities,"Core Awards Honor Art, Music Hum",18 February 2000,"BY DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily SpectatorDuring his junior year, Maurice Toueg, CC '96, was behind in taking classes in his economics major and working late nights at the Spectator. He certainly didn't think that he had time to take a class on Mozart, especially not one that met at 9 a.m. But Professor Elaine Sisman, his former Music Humanities instructor, was teaching the course, and he never missed a class all semester. Sisman, along with Professor of Art David Rosand, was honored last night at the 7th Annual Core Awards for commitment to the Core Curriculum, which speakers said encourages breadth of vision. In his opening remarks, John Mitchell Mason Professor Emeritus William Theodore de Bary distinguished between other forms ofteaching and teaching the Core, which he said required professors to draw students out in a classroom setting. ""Everyone wants to get in on the act of recognizing great teachers,"" he said. ""But there's a difference between getting in front of students and performing and the type of experience the Core provides, where the whole learning group must perform for themselves."" Professor of Art Jonathan Crary said in his introduction that Rosand was intent on keeping the Core Curriculum focused on refining methods of intellectual inquiry rather than on learning specific facts. ""Whenever we interview graduate students applying to be precep-tors for Art Humanities, and we ask them how they would teach, say, the Parthenon, the graduate students always say that they would give their students an overview of the history of Greek sculpture or something,"" Crary said. ""Rosand always says, 'no, that's precisely what you're not going to do.' He understands that that's not what it's about."" Dean Austin Quigley agreed with this sentiment, saying that without the Core, it would be too easy to ""gain depth of knowledge at the expense of breadth of vision."" He added that undergraduate education excessively focused on major-specific instruction allows students to ""learn more and more about less and less."" Rosand said that his experiences teaching Art Humanities were among the best of his career. 'The previous speakers have said that my commitment to the Core is selfless. I consider it the most selfish —in terms of self-fulfill-ing—thing I've done,"" he said. Crary said that it was his experience as a Columbia undergraduate in Rosand's Art Hum section that convinced him to be an Art History major and to go on to become a professor. Sisman defended the Core against charges that it is too timeconsuming. ""From time to time, people suggest that students only be required to take either Art Hum or Music Hum. When I hear people say that, I always think, would you rather cutout your eyes or cut off your ears?'"" Sisman said. In his remarks, de Bary stressed the importance of the Core in an era when college courses are being offered over the Internet. ""It is unlikely that something called 'distance learning' can match the attention given to students by the Core,"" he said. But new technology also gained a favorable mention last night, due to Rosand's attempts to integrate new media into Art Hum instruction. Rosand recently completed the Raphael Project, which uses electronic media to analyze one of Raphael's frescoes and which is now being used by Art Hum staff. ""[Rosand] continues to provide colleagues and preceptors with a powerful sense of the original vision of the Art Humanities program while actively leading efforts to modernize the program for the 21st Century,"" said the event's program notes. Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen said that while he did not take the Core himself because he did not attend Columbia as an undergraduate, he was impressed by the effect that it has had on Columbia graduates. He cited as an example David Denby, CC '65, a film critic who came back to Columbia several years ago to write a book on the Core. ""Most of the time when you have a midlife crisis, you go out and buy a Porsche. If you're a Columbia alum and you have a midlife crisis, you retake Literature Humanities,"" Cohen joked.Art Professor David Rosand is presented with his award."
321,Music Humanities,Puff Daddy vs. Beethoven Classical Music's Faltering Appeal Affects Music Hum,22 February 2000,"Classical Music's Faltering Appeal Affects Music HumBY DANIEL SCHIFF Columbia Daily SpectatorFor years commentators have argued that the classical music lover will one day be as common as the good accordion player. Citing a decrease in record sales, concert attendance, and school music programs, intellectuals and music lovers have used these and other statistics to show that the popularity of classical music is rapidly fading, and will one day be dead if current trends are not changed. On campus, the absence of Wagner pumping out of the dorms may confirm these fears. Dead or alive, however, classical music will always make up some part of the Columbia College experience, for Music Humanities (or Music Hum), which teaches the basics of Beethoven and Mozart, will always be a part of the venerated Core Curriculum. The official answer explaining Music Hum's reason for being has been around in some form or another since the program was born. As Professor Elaine Sisman, who has just won an award for her teaching in Music Humanities, phrased it, the course exists mainly to focus on ""masterpieces of Western art music in their historical and cultural contexts."" This answer, which has been used to describe Music Hum's role since its inception, still carries much weight, yet the purpose of the course may change as more students experience classical music in their Music Hum courses for the first time. With fewer students coming to college with a previous understanding of classical music, Music Hum might well be the lone experience that makes or breaks many students' interest in the art form of classical music. A casual survey of the Music Humanities department showed that many passionate opinions on the music taught in the course abound. Nevertheless, there is much disagreement on how this music ought to be taught to make the course the best it can be. The largest arena of conflict lies in the debate over what type of music should be taught. Sarah Secules, CC 'O3, spoke for many of the students when she praised her section for ""making connections between the classical music on the syllabus and more modern music."" With students more apt to listen to Puff Daddy or Garbage than they are to listen to Palestrina, Secules felt that a movement toward greater comparisons and contrasts in Music Hum might more accessible to all. Professor lan Bent, Chair of the Music Humanities Program, seconded this view. ""I myself,"" he said, ""have used music by the Beatles, Brian Eno, Talking Heads, and many other artists."" Professor Sisman, however, feels differently. Sisman is not opposed to teaching other genres of music per se, but did not seem to have givenmuch consideration to the thought of teaching the music by anyone of the last name Eno. ""I think jazz,"" she said, ""would be made a part of the curriculum —right now it is optional—before '6os to '7os pop would be."" Sisman said that show tunes were ""an interesting case,"" but did not know of them ever having been considered. Another area of dispute was the question of music theory. Some students love it, but many students without prior musical training hate it, a division that leaves professors and graduate students who need to describe the music to students stuck somewhere in the middle. Adriana Helbig, whose early morning section of Music Hum mandates her ability to act as both music instructor and alarm clock, did her best to show her students the structure behind the sound that is music theory. In some instances she was successful, getting her class to understand that chanting had no meter but was rather ""free flowing."" At other times, though, Helbig encountered difficulty explaining fundamental musical concepts. ""Why is the tonic important?"" Helbig asked to a sea of blank faces. Continuing her review of the class's last test, she answered, ""It's the first pitch in the scale. Most of you got it wrong because you were using the books definition of 'most recurring pitch.'"" Stephen Dost, CC 'O3, liked the fact that Helbig taught some theory in class, and desired still more of it. In Dost's view, an improved Music Hum course would offer more detail, not less, including ""text with a more extensive book,"" as well as ""more information on music theory."" Professors Bent and Sisman were ambivalent about theory's role in Music Hum. Both agreed that it was invaluable to understanding music, but each had different reasons for not thinking about the subject extensively For Sisman, it was a problem of practicality. ""Theory [class] works ... because it is a self-selecting group ofstudents. It would never work either as a general requirement or as a part of Music Hum for that reason."" For Bent, it was a problem of higher powers. 'This would be a matter for the College and GS Committees on Instruction,"" he said. ""The Music Department doesn't make decisions of this sort unilaterally."" While many opinions expressed about Music Hum's purpose, goals, and practice were heated and contradictory, one aspect of the program seems to be met with universal acceptance. Generally speaking, music performances are highly appreciated part of the course's curriculum. For Cyrus Golsaz, CC 'Ol, the live baroque ensemble that his professor had arranged for was especially welcome since it included ""singing and playing music on instruments of antiquity,"" which brought the older music alive. Throughout the performance, members of the group stopped to talk about the music. Harpsichordist Dongsok Shin was especially passionate in his description. He told the class that baroque, not unlike jazz, allows for some improvisation by the harpsichordist, elaborating on one phrase of written music with three different ""riffs."" ""You can't improvise when playing Beethoven,"" he warned, ""because the Purists, the Beethoven lovers, will freak out."" The ensemble held the group captivated with their playing for a few minutes more. Soon the ensemble would leave. Nevertheless, the class that had seen the group would carry something with them that will go beyond the next exam. For 45 minutes they saw three performers talk about their music for fun and play their music for love. No instructor or student could fail to see the significance of that, whatever debate there may be over the Music Hum curriculum.Columbia College students are required to complete the one semester long course, Music Humanities, as a part of the Core."

323,Music Humanities,Cross Examines Evolution Of Core Curriculum at CU,22 March 2000,"By DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily SpectatorAs Contemporary Civilization (CC) enters its 80th year, the history of the Core Curriculum has been filled with constant questioning of its purpose and content, historian and author of a book on the Core Timothy Cross said last night at the Faculty House. Cross opened the seminar by explaining that he thought the title of his book, An Oasis of Order, which was decided on by the members of the Trustee committee that commissioned him to write it, was misleading. ""There's order insofar as there's been a set curriculum for 43 years, since the introduction of Art and Music Humanities. But the real story has been one of rethinking,"" Cross said. The Core now must readjust to the University's Enlargement and Enhancement program, which has created a strain on Core faculty, according to Cross. ""There was a time when all thehumanities instructors could sit around a single table,"" Cross said, pointing out that the number of Literature Humanities sections in any given semester has risen from 20 to well over 50 since its 1937 inception. But Cross said that the Core was never as stable as some assume. CC, the flagship of Columbia College's commitment to general education, came about in 1919 partially as a reaction to the College's movement towards pre-professional education at the turn of the 20th century. Cross said that CC's rise to prominence was not without bumps in the road. CC was originally divided into two courses: CC-A the equivalent of what the CC students know today, and CC-B, which focused on current political and economic problems. CC-B was never popular, and, after the increasing specialization of the social sciences in the 19505, was terminated. CC was followed by the Colloquium on Important Books, a survey of great Western literature,in 1932. The colloquium was open to juniors and seniors only by application. This process came under criticism for its elitism, and the colloquium was transformed in 1937 to Humanities A, later called Literature Humanities, which was open to, and eventually required of, all entering students. Cross said that the Core came to a crossroads in 1970, in the midst of the University turmoil of the late 19605. A committee headed by Professor of Slavic Languages Robert Belknap suggested replacing it with distribution requirements. The Administration did not,however, adopt this policy. Cross said he was pleased with his book's subtitle, The Core Curriculum and its Discontents, because it captures the contentious nature of the Core and because it referenced Freud's Civilization and its Discontents, one of the most popular CC texts.There was a time when all the humanities instructors could sit around a single table.' —Timothy Cross, historian and author"
324,Music Humanities,"Core Examined, Defended",13 April 2000,"BY DAVID SOLOWAY Columbia Daily Spectator■ SPEaK sponsors event on Core, bringing students, teachers together.A triumvirate of senior professors discussed the merits and drawbacks of the Core, with one senior professor suggesting that the Core be completely reworked, and two others saying that the Core was strong despite bumps in the road. The 90-minute event was hosted by Students Promoting Empowerment and Knowledge (SPEaK) in order to foster discussion on the legitimacy of the Core. The event featured the following professors, all University titans: Robert Hanning, a 37-year veteran of the Department of English and Comparative Literature, who will teach a section of the Core next year; Theodore de Bary, a creator and founder of Asian Humanities and a member of the Columbia community since 1937; and Jim Zetzel, a professor in the Classics Department and the director of Contemporary Civilization (CC). The debate was an attempt to allow students to interact with faculty who were not only wellinformed about the Core, but willing and able to alter the curriculum to meet student needs, according to University Senator Sofia Berger, CC 'Ol, who served as the modera-tor of the forum. ""There are always people who want to debate the advantages and disadvantages of the Core,"" Berger said. ""And this was an opportunity for students and faculty to examine an important part of their Columbia education."" SPEaK Coordinator Steven Francisco explained the reasoning behind the group's decision to host last night's event. ""It's forums like this that allow us to debate whether or not the West was truly developed by a group of dead white men, or whether the picture was much more complex than that. The fact that somuch of Contemporary Civilization no longer deals with contemporary civilizations speaks to the need for more discussions such as this one."" ""Curricular issues are always of importance to faculty, or should be, and since the Core Curriculum directly affects all College students, and thus indirectly all those who teach them, faculty should certainly be willing to join in serious discussions about such matters,""Francisco said. He added that he felt it important to ""recognize that the core is not static; it has been and continues to be subject to reform and redesign."" ""It is also of grave importance to critically discuss whether or not a Western canon is a social construct or an actual representation of the development of knowledge,"" Francisco said. The forum opened with a presentation from Patrick Jackson, a political science graduate student and current CC instructor. Jackson traced the evolution of the Core from its nascent stages in 1917,where it was offered in collaboration with the Department of War to teach students ""why it was important to fight and die for their country,"" to its dramatic shift in ideology as a result of the riots of 1968. ""The Core is not something that can be defined,"" Jackson said. ""It is constantly changing, constantly evolving."" He added that the purpose of CC is ""per-haps to debate what the purpose of CC really is."" Following Jackson's introduction, Hanning spoke about the shortcomings of the Core and questioned its function in the University. In addition to the numerous resources that each department must commit to teach the Core annually, Hanning has reservations about both the content and marketing of the Core.""I am not fundamentally opposed to college-wide degree requirements,"" said Hanning, who has not taught in the Core for more than 25 years. ""And I realize the advantages of a unifying education for each student in the College. But the Core is not the answer, at least not in its current form."" Hanning cited the problems with Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and CC, but added that he would ""fight hard"" to preserve both Art and Music Humanities, as he feels they are an imperative part of an undergraduate's education. Zetzel defended the CC curriculum: ""It is a constant battle every time we revise the syllabus. The course is a constant race, as we are always trying to keep up."" De Bary, the John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University and Provost Emeritus. He urged the audience to regard the Core as a constant work in progress, due to the fact that new texts, and even new courses, are always being added. ""The Core is never complete,"" said de Bary, who credited Harry Carman, his first Columbia professor and future Dean of the College, as one of the primary influences on his future career in academics. ""The Core is more a process, not a specific body of material."" De Bary's efforts at Columbia College have led to the addition of a two-semester Major Cultures requirement for all undergraduates, as he attempted to confront perennial issues of human society outside of Europe and America. ""There is no such thing as Asian Civilization singular,"" de Bary said. ""There are many distinct and unique cultures, and from thatgroup you have to choose those that have been most influential throughout the course of history."" De Bary believes the purpose of the Core is to show students how much knowledge is available to them if they search for it. ""You are given a small taste of certain landmarks of European tradition, and to a lesser extent that of Asian tradition,"" he said. ""And after that, one would hope that you have the desire to go on and learn more than you ever imagined."" Contemporary Civilization and Lit Hum, according to de Bary, are courses that are limited by time but that still strive to teach students ""to express themselves and better communicate their thoughts and ideas."" Echoing de Bary's optimism about both the Core and its future, Zetzel also stressed that the Core was far from immutable. ""There is an institutional belief that there should be common content for all Columbia students,"" said Zetzel, who has been at the University for the last 15 years. ""And there is also a belief that as Columbia students and faculty change, so should the Core."" He said that the CC and Lit Hum syllabi are always under revision,, with new texts chosen every two years. ""Everyone finds at least a small part of the Core unsatisfactory,"" Zetzel said. ""There are some texts that I teach in CC that I feel do not belong. But the value of a common curriculum outweighs the disadvantages."" Zetzel also feels that the Core is valuable for the professors who teach it. ""We are forced to interact and discuss the texts with students who"
325,Music Humanities,Seeing the Music CU Celebrates the Evolution Composition,12 July 2000,"CU Celebrates the Evolution CompositionBY PETER CARTER Columbia Summer Spectator""What is exciting to consider is that youngsters in school today are growing up with exposure to electronic music, and it is an accepted part of their musical life... The future is wide open for the medium."" The year was 1970 and the speaker was Otto Luening, Professor Emeritus of Music at Columbia and co-founder of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (re-named the Computer Music Center (CMC) in 1995). The occasion was a retrospective of electronic music in Low Library. This Thursday, the next generation of electronic music makers returns to the Rotunda to celebrate the past half-century of electronic music and to showcase their current projects. The event, entitled Masterpieces of 20th Century Electronic Music, is part of Lincoln Center's Electronic Evolution series. On May 9, 1952, Professor Vladimir Ussachevsky gave the first electronic music concert in the United States at Columbia's McMillin Theater (now Miller Theater). A member of Columbia's music faculty, Ussachevsky joined with Luening that October for the first American public performance of tape recorder music at the Museum of Modern Art. At the time, recorded music was state-of-the-art. ""It was a big deal,"" said CMC director Brad Garton, ""to take a note and move it 10 seconds forward or backward, rearranging sounds in time through tape splicing."" In 1959, with a grant of $175,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation, Ussachevsky and Luening joined pro-fessor-composers Milton Babbit and Roger Sessions, both of Princeton University, to found the ColumbiaPrinceton Electronic Music Center, the first of its kind in the country. The prized possession of the new group was the custom designed RCA Mark II Synthesizer. ""Prior to theRCA Mark 11, composers had to set everything by hand,"" recalled Garton. The potential to use this synthesizer as an instrument itself was realized by Robert Moog, SEAS '57. ""Bob Moog took the voltage controlled oscillators [of the Mark II],"" saidGarton, ""and connected them to a keyboard."" Later, Wendy Carlos, working as a graduate student in the music department, would introduce electronic music to a nation of listeners. Her 1968 album Switched-On Bach, which consisted of pieces by Bach played on the Moog, would win three Grammy Awards and be the first classical music album to reach platinum sales levels. ""A lot of people felt that she was retrograding,"" said Garton. ""But it showed the world —and fueled the explosion of technology in music."" Professor Thanassis Rikakis, curator of the Masterpieces of Electronic Music event explained the climate of the period, saying, ""Columbia's music department was one of the first places in the country to make its technology available to students. Columbia in the '6os, said Rikakis, ""was a breeding ground for early electronic music technology."" The most recent commercial success story to come out of the CMC has been the Freight Elevator Quartet (FEQ). Band members Luke Dußois, CC '97, Rachael Finn, BC '99, Paul Feuer, CC '97, and Stephen Kreiger, CC '97, came together as undergraduates at Columbia and developed their sound and their software at the CMC. Founded in 1996, FEQ's most recent album was a collaboration with DJ Spooky entitled File Under Futurism. Their next album, Becoming Transparent, is due out this September. Rikakis cites FEQ as a great example of today's CMC. ""The center is very open to students and helping them realize their ideas,"" he said. Recently, the CMC has been nurturing interdisciplinary projects with other departments and schools at Columbia. Last semester, the Music and Art Departments at Columbia teamed up to offer Interactivity Out of the Box, a class where graduate students from across the School of the Arts' divisions design multimedia installation projects. Plans are underway for a class with Barnard's dance department as well as joint ventures with the electrical engineering and computer science departments. At the College ofPhysicians and Surgeons, researchers from the music department are working on what Rikakis refered to as a ""sound feedback for rehabilitation project."" ""I can't tell you any more,"" he said, ""because we're applying for a patent right now."" The news will be made public in August. This Thursday, from 8-9 p.m., seven installations will be presented in the Faculty Room of Low Library. The projects, created by Columbia graduate students, are hands-on opportunities for visitors to experience new computer music technologies. Soundscape Navigator, the project of Luke Dußois and Mark McNamara, is a demonstration of Quicktime virtual reality. ""We've taken sonograms and wallpapered a virtual room,"" said Dußois. ""What you seeds what you hear."" From 9-11 p.m., the CMC will present a concert featuring representative artists —Edgar Varese, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Paul Lansky, JeanBaptiste Barriere, Denis Smalley, and lannis Xenakis —and their works from the past 50 years of electronic music. The pieces have been specially chosen for their performance in the reverberant space of the Low Library Rotunda. For each piece, the composer will be introduced and his technique explained. Real-time maps, projected on a screen during the concert, will provide visual representations of the music's energy, amplitude, and frequency. Online program notes are available at www.music.columbia.edu/masterpieces. Beginning this Wednesday, Lincoln Center will present Electronic Evolution as part of its Festival 2000. Music ranges from orchestral Theremin and Ondes Martenot pieces to turntable adaptations of John Cage. There are even a few pieces you learned about in Music Humanities.A sound visualization of lannis Xenakis' electroacoustic ""Bohor.""COURTESY OFWWW.ZAPPA.COM Edgar Varese (above) composed ""Poeme Electronique"" in 1958.

326,Music Humanities,Boy Bands Revisited: An Evening with 'N Sync,26 July 2000,"FUTILE WARS BY SARAH WEINTRAUBWhoops, I did it again. As a dutiful slave to pop-culture, I spent this past Sunday night cheering along with twelve year old girls to the awesome tunes of everyone's favorite boy band, 'N Sync. A sold-out show is a rarity, especially when the venue has a maximum capacity of 60,000 people, 99 percent of which has yet to purchase its first training bra —an orthodontist's wet dream.. When my dear friend, Jackie, told me that she had an extra ticket to the 'N Sync show, I was a bit intimidated by the prospect of being with thousands of teenage girls living out their wildest fantasy. Could I, the queen ofno-frills, oldies music, and low hemlines, appreciate such an event? A chameleon in training, I donned my favorite (only) tube-top, crimped my hair, wrote ""I love Justin"" on my exposed midriff, and got ready for a night of totally tubular entertainment. As we drove into the Foxboro Stadium, itbecame clear that no amount of Steve Madden, Hard Candy nail-polish or shinny tube tops would bridge this age-gap. Jackie and 1 spotted some cool looking guys who seemed about our age, and suffered a great deal of disappointment as they entered the large, white tent labeled ""Parents' Waiting Area."" In our seats, I attempted to minglewith my fellow 'N Sync groupies. My newly purchased 'N Sync tour shirt became my ticket to the cool crowd. The girl sitting next to me, admiring my shirt,asked, ""Isn't Justin hot? Don't you just love 'N Sync?"" With the confidence of a newly acceptedpre-teen, I answered, ""Yeah, I mean he is even hotter than Donny from the New Kids on the Block."" Her right hand formed an L and smacked her forehead before I could recognize the stupidity of my statement. While I was impressed with my parents' tales of following the Dead, my level of lame-ness plummeted to an all time low with my confession of previous Boy Bandworship. Boy Band religion allows for only one God, the existence of previous gods is as unkosher as a doublebacon cheeseburger on Saturday. The only Wahlberg these girls have ever heard of is Marky-Mark. MilliVanilli is nothing more than a potential Ben and Jerry's flavor, and the phrase ""Pump up the Jam"" conjures nothing but possible activities at the Smuckers factory.The No-Strings-Attached tour is a spectacle built around a group of pretty-faced boys, with minimal singing talent, but an outstanding ability to 1 • • T~» jdance in unison.

327,Music Humanities,Enrollment For Summer Session Rises,2 August 2000,"BY SUNNIE KIM Columbia Summer Spectator■ Small classes, personal instruction attract over 2,300 to Summer SessionStudents searching for a meaningful way to spend their summers have increasingly turned towards the University's summer session. Whether the participants hope to fulfill core curriculum requirements or perhaps hone potentially marketable skills, one fact is evident: the popularity of the program is increasing. This year's summer session has increased enrollment 19 percent since 1998, resulting in almost 2,400 participants, according to Director of Summer Session Dr. Carole Slade. For these students, the most popular reason to take summer courses is to gain course credit at either Columbia or, for the 480 students who do not attend Columbia during the academic year, at their respective college or university. ""98 percent of the...courses I direct confer college or graduatelevel credit,"" Slade said. ""Students using the summer to try out new fields choose to take the courses for non-credit."" Among the most popular summer courses that students take for credit include core requirements such as Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Latin American Humanities. In addition, courses that count towards majors and classes like photography and other equipment-based courses whichhave limitations of enrollment, thereby closing quickly during the year are also popular. For students who do not have room in their fall and spring schedules to focus on their potentially marketable skills, the summer offers students a chance to take classes like computer game programming and corporate finance. Students who face problems trying to get a spot in an especially popular course during the regular academic year are more likely to take courses like Professor Katherine Morgan's Introduction to Accounting and Finance and Professor Kristiaan Versluys' New York City in Recent Fiction. During the summer students have an easier time enrolling in these popular courses. As a result of the smaller pool of students during the summer, popular courses such as these are, according to Slade, ""usually smaller than academic-year courses, allowing a good deal of individual attention."" Professor Besserman, currently a Professor of English and Comparative Literature from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem teaches a course entitled Bible and English Literature. With 20 registered students in his class and several auditors, the personal interaction between professor and student has impressed Besserman. ""I'm gratified with the high level of dicussion and the fact that they teach me too,"" Besserman said. The classes, which are more diverse in the summertime, have a mix of students from the four undergraduate schools and graduate schools at the University. Besserman's course, which he characterizes as a ""nice variety [of students]"" has a balanced mix of undergraduates and graduate stu-dents. ""[The classes] are definitely smaller and more intimate...there are students from other schools,"" Daniela Mitrovich GS 'Ol, said. As for the rigor of these summer courses, summer school personnel, administrators, and students agree that the quality of these classes and the amount of work expected from students remain the same as during the academic year. To attest to the quality and intensity of these classes, Isabel Trafton, GS 'O2, noted that even ""two science classes at a time was way too hard."" Students had mixed reactions to the truncated time for each class, some appreciating the increased amount of information but others wondering whether they will remember all the information once the class is over. Mitrovich, who is currently taking Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature believed that the intensity of a summer class made it easier for her to absorb the information. However, Trafton, who is also enrolled in the same course course said, ""I liked doing things intensely, but I don't know how much I'll remember later on."" Nevertheless, Slade and some students noted that summer classesare often the highlight of a student's academic career. ""Students often comment that their summer courses are among the best they have taken at Columbia,"" Slade said. Mitrovich, who despite disliking the courses she has taken over the summer, attributed her problems with the professors themselves and ""nothing to do with summer session."" ""But I generally think the classes in summer are better. I get more because there is a lot of info in a shorter amount of time,"" Mitrovich said. Slade hopes that the summer courses, despite their shortened length, will still provide students with the same amount of academic challenge, even serving as an equivalent to the academic year courses. ""My goal is to offer high-quality courses that complement or extend the academic-year offering,"" Slade said. ""Of necessity, summer courses are different, in that they are compressed into six weeks. If the courses are well-planned and if students avoid overextending themselves with a heavy work schedule, similar results can be achieved."" Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis noted that theCommittee on Instruction (COI) now approves all courses offered in the summer that will receive college credit. As a result, Yatrakis said, ""this is a very good change in policy and means that the faculty see the summer session as having the potential to enhance our curricular offerings to students."" Columbia students who wish to enroll in these classes are automatically accepted into the session. Those from other universities and colleges undergo an application process, which Slade explained to be as a good indicator of whether a student would be able to flourish in Columbia's academic setting. ""Students are admitted only if their academic records suggest that they will be able to succeed in Columbia's very competitive academic environment,"" Slade said. Faculty members during the summer session, of which approximately 10 percent hold full-time professorial positions at Columbia, and of which about 15 percent hold regular or part-time positions as instructors or lecturers at the University, number almost 200. In addition, professors from other colleges and universities also have ties to Columbia, many of them alumni of the undergraduate or graduate programs. Professor Besserman, CC '6B, who taught his English class last summer as well, explained that the favorable experience he had at the University during his undergraduate years, in addition to the locale of Morningside Heights, have encouraged him to teach again at the University this summer. ""[The University] is really thriving—very desirable —as it was when I was here,"" Besserman said. Additional Research by Derek NarendraCourses like this printmaking class, which normally fill up quickly due to enrollment limits, are more accessible in the summer."
328,Music Humanities,Core Profs. Honored in Ceremony,15 November 2000,"BY AMBA DATTA Spectator Staff Writer■ Speakers award gifted faculty, discuss concerns for future of the Core.During a ceremony marked by concern about the future of what Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley termed the ""intellectual signature"" of the College, Professors Robert Belknap and Richard Kuhns were honored with the annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum. Held in the Heyman Humanities Center last evening, the ceremony featured several speakers lauding the contributions to the Core made by Belknap, professor in the Slavic Languages and Literature Department, and Kuhns, professor emeritus of philosophy. Professor J. W. Smit, the Queen Wilhelmina Professor of the History, Language, and Literature of the Netherlands, received a special award in recognition of his accomplishment as the only professor to have taught the four Core Curriculum classes: Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. While the evening focused on celebrating the professors' achievements and the continued existence of the Core, both the speakers and honorees expressed their concerns about the future of the Core in the face of the College's expanding population. Michael Rosenthal, professor of English and Comparative Literature, spoke on the difficulties of staffing the Core Curriculum, which requires a large number of professors and instructors for all the class sections, which are capped at 22 students. ""No one before [Smit] has had the range, capacity, and commitment to teach all four [courses]... He is a man who has totally embodied and internalized the values of the Core,"" Rosenthal said. John Rosenberg, the William Peter field Trent professor ofEnglish and Comparative Literature, noting that students in his classes often have to go into other classrooms to find enough chairs, emphasized the need to cap the size of Core classes and his own concern over the expansion of the College. He also expressed concern over the increase in the number of sections of Core classes. 'This is wonderful from one perspective,"" he said. ""From another, it's the end of the collegiality of the staff,"" referring to the different levels of experience that Core preceptors and professors have. Smit also had concerns, particularly in connection with the expertise of instructors of the Core Curriculum saying that ""the question of whether we are serving our students as well"" should be examined."" Smit made a comparison to Pericles' funeral oration in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War when he said ""I think what we learn from those classical texts is how fast an ideal state can be changed.""He urged necessary planning for the future of Core Curriculum staffing before a true celebration of the Core Curriculum could be held. ""Only when we have made that decision do we have the right to celebrate being here together,"" Smit said. Quigley responded to these concerns and emphasized administrative awareness of staffing problems with the Core. Quigley said that as of now, the Administration is addressing concerns through an Endowment for the Core, an ongoing fundraising activity. He said the endowment will probably provide for approximately 10 Core chairs awarded on a rotating basis for fiveyear terms. Quigley was not surprised by the honorees' concerns. 'This is a conversation that goes on in the background all the time,"" he said. ""I was glad [to have] the opportunity to be able to address what we're doing."" Belknap received his Ph.D from Columbia in 1960. He served as director of the Russian Institute, now known as the Harriman Institute, from 1974-1977 and is anauthority on Dostoevsky. He currently teaches the Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and 19th Century Russian Drama courses, as well as Literature Humanities. Belknap has also published works analyzing plots in narrative and drama. Kuhns also received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1960. He specializes in aesthetics and has written on classical philosophy and drama. As a teacher of Literature Humanities as well, Kuhns is particularly interested in Apuleius' The Golden Ass and Boccaccio's The Decameron. Rosenberg observed that it was particularly appropriate that Kuhns and Belknap receive the award together. Kuhns and Belknap coauthored Tradition and Innovation, General Education and the Reintegration of the University in 1977. It covered, Rosenberg said, a time when the ""disintegration of the university and nation seemed a closer reality than reintegration."" Additionally, the two instituted a series of seminars in the 1970s on general education encompassing the different schools of the University.""Both have sustained their commitment to general education for over four decades,"" said Rosenberg. Director of the Heyman Humanities Center, Professor Wm. Theodore de Bary said that both professors have been ""identified long with not only the Core Curriculum and humanities courses but with the whole idea of generaleducation as exemplified by the Core Curriculum."" All the speakers praised the two professors' commitment to the Core Curriculum. ""We clearly owe a special debt to the faculty who have been dedicated to maintaining its vitality and excellence,"" Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen said.Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen, right, honored Professor Robert Belknap for his service to the Core Curriculum.Professor Emeritus Richard Kuhns, center, accepted his honor last night.

329,Music Humanities,Where's the Money?,25 January 2001,"The Weissing on the Cake By Kike WeissColumbia University just completed a $2.8 billion fundraising campaign. Hmm. And none of my friends can get into any of their classes. Junior and senior years at Columbia traditionally involve a movement away from the core curriculum into more specialized classes within their range of interests. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations are replaced by 4000-level classes like Post-Pre-Industrial Colonization and its Raphaelite Transgender Affirmation of the American Male in (hyper) Popular and Non-Specific Anti-Culture. (I haven't taken it; I hear it's all Teaching Assistants.) Lectures are replaced by seminars, graduate students are replaced by actual professors, and everyone is meant to begin a beautiful two-year period of general enlightenment. The only problem is, of course, that all the classes are full. Anything that sounds interesting has been pre-pre-registered for, with students buttering up their prospective professors months before registration. Lists of hopeful students are compiled, wait lists develop, and suddenly we have created a twice-annual expectation that all students must stand in intellectual bread lines, waiting for their esteemed professors to hand them the sustenance that they crave deep down in unspeakable parts of the human psyche next to recipes for pot brownies and Wilson Phillips lyrics. So where has this $2.8 billion injection into our already cushy endowment gone? We have a new student center that came in a scant $26 million over-budget. The sod on South Lawn is replaced every couple of months, and it remains green for about two and a half days, until the South American Amateur Soccer League hears that its field has been repaired. Lions Court is still made out of corrugated metal, and it is still destroying the campus's claim to aesthetic pride. There should be plenty of leftover cash. Why haven't new professors been hired? The English department is not crowded. There is plenty of room for more professors. No one would object. Why is it that when $3 billion are raised, classes are still shutting students out at record rates? Shouldn't hiring new professors be the very first expenditure for a school that has just successfully raised more money than anyone could ever be expected to count? Of course, I could be just another radical peacenik speaking off the cuff and tellin' it like it is. Money is wasted at this school by the truckload. We throw parties every night of the week in Low Rotunda, and I have yet to be invited. Not once. George Rupp's bi-monthlytrip to the beauty salon? Columbia picks up the tab. Granite-and marble-stud our campus, their expense belied by their inability to offer traction in slippery conditions. And granite and marble do not come cheap. Lions. They are two of the most expensive rocks on the market, coming in just after The Rock. It costs $35,000 to go to this college, a price tag that increases at about a 2.5 to 3.0 percent rate, never mind that the inflation rate over the past ten years has hovered at about 1.2 percent. What does that mean, all you nonecon majors? It means that it is damn expensive to go to this school. A lot of parents would be shocked to learn that during their children's first two years at Columbia College, they were taught by graduate students in Lit Hum, C.C., Logic and Rhetoric, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. It's not necessarily a waste of money to have a professor-free college education; but then again watching Road Rules and The Real World compete in a tattoo contest in Park City, Utah isn't a complete waste of time either. Which is to say that it, is a waste of money to attend a college where it is more difficult to take a class with an actual professor than it is to receive an A.' Two point eight billion American dollars. The possibilities are endless. They're difficult to imagine. Columbia could buy its own XFL team, the New York Teaching Assistants. We could fund a program to teach undergraduates and high school students how to teach college classes, to free up busy graduate students who are composing their theses on Formations of Sexual Identity: Pre-Acculturalized Art and Artifact in Post-Radio Indochina. We could hire Emeril Lagasse to be the chef de cuisine at John Jay Dining Hall. (""You left your card in your dorm room? BAM! You need your card there brother, BAM!!!"") All ""zany"" ""off-beat"" ideas aside, Columbia University should hire more degree-bearing, actual professors. To teach classes. It's a simple concept, something I've been working on over the past few weeks. I believe that upperclassmen have earned a class or two that wasn't taught by a wet-behind-the-ears, jumpy, unprofessional, whiny, incompetent graduate student who can't find the remote control to turn off the lights so that he can show the class a riveting video covering the mating habits of poisonous tree frogs and their analogous place in a feminist understanding of the worker's representation in print media. More professors is a simple, good idea.Mike Weiss is a Columbia College junior majoring in English and Comparative Literature."

331,Music Humanities,"At Columbia, Jazz Is Alive and Thriving Jazz clubs and CU dorm lounges attract student aficionados nightly",28 February 2002,"Jazz clubs and CU dorm lounges attract student aficionados nightlyBy Christopher Mellia Columbia Daily SpectatorI'm sitting alone in the corner of John Jay dining hall, having just finished my dinner —a plate of plain pasta, a couple of oatmeal cookies, and two glasses of Coca-Cola. As I reach to pick up my empty tray, I hear someone calling my name. I turn around and see my friend Nate walking towards me, carrying an apple in one hand and wheeling his upright bass with the other. He acknowledges the strange look that I'm giving him as he explains, ""I've got a gig in ten minutes, and I want-ed to get dinner first. Oh, by the way, you want to go see Brad Mehldau with me at the Vanguard on Friday?"" Nate Franco, CC 'O5, is one of the hundreds of big-time jazz fans at Columbia. He plays bass in two different Columbia jazz trios and attends jazz clubs regularly. When Nate arrived at Columbia back in August, his first priority was to frequent the city's various jazz clubs. Of course, he made sure that I understood just how important his excursions were by telling me that ""Visiting New York City withoutenjoying a couple of sets at the jazz clubs is like taking a trip to Chicago in mid-July and not catching an afternoon baseball game at Wrigley Field —you just don't do it."" Birdland, Village Vanguard, and Small's are just a few of the clubs that Nate and hundreds of his fellow classmates consider hot spots on weekend nights. And Columbia's location certainly makes these spots very accessible. Birdland, located in near Times Square, is only a twenty minute subway ride from the Morningside campus, while Small's, a less expensive alternative, is alsoonly a short 1/9 subway ride away. These jazz clubs are among New York's landmarks and, as Dave Russell, CC 'O2 class Vice President and jazz musician, points out, ""I grew up in L. A, which is often compared to New York. However, when you look at each city's jazz clubs, there's no comparison. When it comes to jazz, L.A. is a small-time, one-horse town, while New York is a thriving and vibrant jazz metropolis."" Matt Sarnecki, a CC sophomore who often frequents Small's says, ""I think Small's is a perfect place for a date. It's a hip atmosphere in a fun part of the city, and the music is great."" Other Columbia students are jazz purists and follow their favorite musicians around the city. Dan Wise, CC 'O4, a huge jazz fan, asserts, ""I've seen Brad Mehldau play three times this year—twice at the Vanguard and once at 8.8 King's. He's one of my favorite musicians, and I try to see him whenever he's in town."" But Columbia provides a great deal more musical intrigue than just access to historical clubs for jazz enthusiasts —it offers its students a very creative musical environment. Located just a couple of blocks south of Manhattan School of Music, Columbia often gets overlooked as a legitimate musical forum. Perhaps it is not that customary to find Columbia students performing at jazz clubs around the city, but groups of Columbia students playing together in residence hall lounges have become a very familiar sight. Student groups have become so popular on campus that various jazz trios even provide free concerts in the Living and Learning Center every couple of weeks. Columbia also offers its studentsthe chance to see professional musicians at discounted rates. Over the course of the past year, jazz musicians ranging from the well-known pianist Fred Hersch to the acclaimed Wynton Marsalis have performed on campus. And the music department has made great strides in recent years to improve itself, as Columbia now offers a wide range of jazz classes. The department, which offers classes ranging from jazz transcription class to upper-level ear-training classes, is certainly on the rise. Also, Chris Washburne's jazz class has quickly become one of the most popular among students. Washburne, who also teaches a Caribbean music course and a Music Humanities section, has toured with the likes of Marc Anthony, Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, making a name for himself as one of the world's most acclaimed jazz trombonists. Washburne's own band, Syotos, performs regularly at Smoke and the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe. It seems natural that jazz has become so popular at Columbia and has gained such an integral place in the student body's consciousness, considering the fact that New York City has played a huge role in the genre's popularization. Perhaps what one finds more striking than the popularity of the music is the fact that it is almost impossible to walk from one building on campus to the next without seeing a couple of students gathered in a small circle, carrying their instruments and discussing their craft. But maybe this apparent obsession shouldn't come as a surprise because, as Charlie Parker pointed out, ""Music is your own experience, your thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn.""St. Paul's Chapel is home to the performances of many student and professional jazz musicians."

333,Music Humanities,"Swordplay, Seduction, and Star Quality Strong vocal performances and brilliant staging make Don Giovanni a hit",28 March 2002,"Strong vocal performances and brilliant staging make Don Giovanni a hitBy Jax Russo Spectator Theater EditorAs an opera traditionalist, I usually dread trips to City Opera, the redheaded stepchild of the New York opera community. Known for its unconventional staging and interpretation, City Opera is always trying to achieve some distance from its next door neighbor, the Met. The spring run of Don Giovanni, however, is true to the opera in its original form. With the exception of a pregnant Donna Elvira (ahem, a modern interpretation), the show remains true to Mozart's original ideas. Its lack of shock value was disappointing, mainly because that is what I have come to expect from City Opera. In short, Don Giovanni is the myth of Don Juan set to the music of Mozart. Don Giovanni, accompanied by his faithful servant Leporello, plays Europe's favorite playboy, confessing an undeniable weakness for the female figure, an unhealthy need for attention, and the wealth and good looks to seduce anyone hechooses. The plot moves not only through Don Giovanni's exploits and conquests, but also through those who follow him in hopes of exposing his true nature. Donna Anna and her husband are after Giovanni because he has ravaged her and killed her father—all in a span of roughly twenty minutes —while Donna Elvira seeks out Don Giovanni after his three-day love-and-leave escapade. And while all of these women are on his trail, Giovanni still attempts to seduce a peasant girl, Zerlina, on her wedding day. Peter Coleman-Wright played Don Giovanni perfectly as the strong, conceited male seducer (To give a better idea of the character, Music Humanities Professor Chris Washburne recalls a production of Don Giovanni where Don Giovanni's costume was black leather, head to toe). Coleman-Wright not only acted as the main consolidating element for the opera, but combined a fabulous vocal performance with anequal theatrical effort. His arias were never stagnant, but rather full of physical movement and position changes. His seduction of Zerlina and his 'conversations with Elvira were almost balletic; at times, words were more of an added element to his beautifully scripted body language.Nathan Berg, as Giovanni's faithful servant, put in a performance equal to ColemanWright's, most notably in the famous ""catalogue aria."" This duo is what made the opera so fabulous; their chemistry as master and servant was phenomenal. Each acquired, both physically andthrough pantomime, specific actions to compliment the motivic consistency of their characters' music. Equally impressive were the performances of Zerlina's bridegroom Masetto, played by Kevin Burdette, and Don Ottavio, played by Raul Hernandez. Hernandez's beautiful tenor voice was clear and lyrical, atext-book definition of a top-notch vocal performance. Burdette, as the slighted partner of Zerlina, was quickly able to gain the audience's sympathy, not only by his own fine performance of Masetto, but because of the fine acting of Mariaterea Magisano (Zerlina). Magisano had the weakest voice in the show, but her facial expressions and incorporated stylistic vocal elements solidified her performance and her appeal to the audience at large. The strongest female vocally waswithout a doubt Alexandrina Pendatchanska, who played the role of Donna Anna. Although her arias required little physical movement, the sheer strength and force of her huge soprano voice was phenomenal. I was quickly drawn into the performance because of .Pendatchanska, as her terror and sadness seemed so real in the first five minutes of the opera. As she arches her back, shrieking wildly as she is attacked by Don Giovanni, the tone of the opera is set. And just as the audience thinks her horror is over, she discovers the dead body of her father. The scenery and costuming done by the City Opera was unparalleled. After viewing a performance of Madame Butterfly where a more minimalist approach was taken to costuming and scenery (never a good idea when performing a Puccini Opera), the group redeemed itself with a series of day/night color schemes, slanting horizon sets and super-high wall and door structures. Don Giovanni is perhaps one of the best operas to catch if you have never seen an opera, or if you had a bad first experience. Complete with dueling, murder, seduction and sexual promiscuity, it makes HBO's Sunday night fare seem like a Disney Channel lineup. So turn off that TV set and combine your conflicting desires to get your weekly dose of bawdy entertainment and to ""better"" yourself by watching one of Mozart's best.Leporello (Nathan Berg) tells Donna Elvira (Amy Burton) that she is one of many conquests."
334,Music Humanities,Week In Review,29 March 2002,"For the week of March 25NYC Police Department Recruits at Columbia The first stop on a tour that will include all eight Ivy League universities, Columbia hosted a bevy of uniformed New York Police Department officers on Wednesday, including Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. The purpose of the event, held in the International Affairs Building lobby, was to recruit Columbia University students to become NYPD officers.About 15 officers attended the event, and by its end, 53 students had signed up to enroll in training that would lead up to their taking an officer's exam. Passing the exam, as well as being an American citizen and having either 60 college credits or two years in the military, is a prerequisite for a student to become a NYPD officer. Student Council ApprovesUpdates to Its Constitution After a six-week review by a subcommittee of its board, the Columbia College Student Council has adopted changes to its constitution. The revisions will consolidate some board positions and expand the scope of others. Among the most important revisions is the creation of the position of vice president for campus life, which merges the positions of vice president for programming and intergroup representative. The revision will maintain the three-vice-president structure, which was implemented in 2000. The new vice president for campus life ""will not only serve as a resource to the student groups but will also work with ihem to create events that are geared to the larger Columbia College community,"" said CCSC President Michael Novielli, CC 'O3. The CCSC's change in focus from programming to improving general issues of student life has been evolving over recent CCSC boards. CU Graduate School Applicants Increase In the of a weakened economyand job market, Columbia's graduate schools have noted a dramatic increase in applications for the 2002-03 academic year. Columbia's School of Law reported an approximate 25 percent increase in applications this year. Eight thousand applications have been received for 350 spots, following the school's second largest application year with 6,500 applications for the same 350 positions last year. The early decision numbers show the same trend with a 40 percent increase from last year. According to James Milligan, the dean of admissions of the School of Law, there is a direct correlation this year between economic trends and application trends.Columbia students traveled to El Salvador with a Jewish youth organization to perform community service projects.City Opera performed Don Giovanni for Music Humanities."
335,Music Humanities,Staff Editorial Art for Art's Sake An Art Hum exemption test would benefit students and faculty.,23 October 2002,"Art for Art's SakeAn Art Hum exemption test would benefit students and faculty.Columbia College prides itself on the Core Curriculum. The Core asks students to take courses that, in many cases, they may not otherwise choose. Students thus graduate from the College with a broad, shared academic background in the studies of art, music, science, foreign languages and cultures, and the humanities. The College makes exceptions for students to test out of the languages and Music Humanities, and should offer an Art Humanities exemption exam as well. Students proficient in a foreign language have the option of taking an exemption exam. Similarly, students with an adequate background in music can test out of Music Humanities; roughly 50 percent of the 60-odd students who take the music exemption test each year pass. A similar exam for Art Humanities is an important option. Some students arrive at Columbia with high marks in AP Art History or with an otherwise considerable exposure to the arts, and should be exempt from the course. Art Humanities is a useful course because it provides a general introduc-tion to art history and art criticism and teaches students to consider art in new ways. The limited class size generates a healthy discussion atmosphere. Unfortunately, as a small and required course, the class size puts an undue strain on the Art History department—especially given the recent enlargement of the College. Allowing some students to test out of the course would ease the pressures that the department faces. More importantly, the exemption option would eliminate what is an unnecessary inconvenience for some students. It is difficult for students to fulfill the Core's extensive requirements while pursuing such undertakings as study abroad, multiple majors or concentrations, internships, and extracurricular activities. Those who have no need for the basic Art Humanities instruction should not spend their time taking the course. Though the Core experience is crucial, there are other aspects of college life that deserve priority. If a student is qualified to test out of Art Humanities, he or she should have the option."
336,Music Humanities,Professors Recognized For Service To Core,22 November 2002,"By Katie Goldstein Spectator Associate News Editor■ lan Bent and Eileen Gillooly were honored at yesterday's ceremony.Yesterday's reception for the Tenth Annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum was characterized by a lighter atmosphere than one might expect from an academic award ceremony. Lan Bent, Anne Parsons Bender Professor of Music, and Eileen Gillooly, Director of the College Core Curriculum, received the Core Award, while Sandra Pierson Prior, associate professor of English and Comparative Literature, was recognized with a special award for service in the Logic and Rhetoric program. At the reception, which was held in the Heyman Center for the Humanities, faculty and students praised the accomplishments of the three professors and their instrumental roles in the Core, often adding humorous anecdotes to their speeches. Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley praised the renowned Core in his opening remarks to the reception. ""National interest in general education is gaining renewed momentum,"" Quigley said, citing a recent article from the Harvard Crimson that praised Columbia's Core as a model for the restructuring of Harvard's own core curriculum. In his remarks about Bent, Music Professor Walter Frisch read several definitions of the word ""core"" from the Oxford English Dictionary, all of which he said stray from the more positive associations of the word today. His reading of the definitions, which ranged from ""something that sticks in one's throat"" to ""a disease of sheep,"" provoked laughter from the attendees. ""Lan has been a coeur [French for heart],"" Frisch said of Bent's 16 years at Columbia. ""He caught on so quickly and became so involved in the spirit of our Core."" Frisch praised Bent, who has been chairman of Music Humanities for the past five years, for innovations in the course's web site. Maja Cerar, a graduate student instructor of Music Humanities, who collaborated with Bent on partsof the-web site, cited Bent's ""diligence, energy, and perseverance that I never would have thought to lie in one person's personality."" Gillooly was equally commended for her contribution to the core. Professor Cathy Popkin praised Gillooly as ""the core of the Core,"" and paraphrased Saint Augustine in an homage to Literature Humanities: ""You are great Eileen and greatest to be praised."" ""I was sure that she must have won the award already,"" said Professor James Zetzel, Director of Contemporary Civilization, adding that Gillooly has headed the Core longer than the Core Award has existed. Both speakers emphasized Gillooly's administrative skill as director of the Core. After receiving their awards, Bent and Gillooly each addressed what they have learned as a result of their involvement with the Core. ""I realized I must throw away the score and engage with the music,"" Bent said of teaching Music Humanities. Popkin described the knowledge she has gained about various academic departments due to the Core's reliance on professors from about 15 different departments. Prior was praised for integrating writing into the Core Curriculum. Edward Tayler, the ""patriarch of L&R"" and Lionel Trilling Professor in Humanities, spoke about Prior after quipping that the three-minute time limit for speaking was ""scarcely enough time to protest there's not enough time."" Citing her ""combination of sympathy, humanity, and rigor,"" Tayler called the position of L&R instructor ""the most difficult teaching assignment in the University,"" adding that Prior had guided hundreds of graduate students in the teaching of writing to undergraduates. ""L&R could not have lasted more than two semesters if she had not had the power to resist,"" Tayler said, referencing calls to change the curriculum during Prior's directorship of the composition program. After receiving her award, Prior spoke of the aspects of Columbia's composition program she hopes will remain in her absence and of her desire to continue to see ""students become their own best editors."""
337,Music Humanities,Run DMC and Bing Crosby: Best Friends 4-Eva,29 April 2003,"SMEE'S TREASURES MUSIC FOR THE OPEN-MINDED BY R.S.F. SMEEColumbia College prods all its students into Music Humanities, hoping that they might gain an awareness and understanding of (and perhaps even an appreciation for) what is loosely termed ""classical"" music. Columbia does nothing to further its students' awareness, understanding, or appreciation for what is equally loosely termed ""popular"" music, apart from offering asurvey class or two in rock and jazz. On the surface, this makes sense: popular music should be just that,and should therefore not need any specific introduction. But most people's music tastes are—for lack of a better word—more niche-ified than ever. Not everyone would —or should —like every form of music on earth. But hauteur in the face of all types of music but one is, quite frankly, just as stupid as eating nothing but yogurt. Like some foods, some types of music are acquired tastes. But think of all the things you now like to eat (or, perhaps even more potently, all the things you now like to drink), and remember how many of them you used to think were gross. Acquiring a taste for new kinds of music is just as important as acquiring a taste for pickles, or cheddar, orwine: you won't be a bad person if you don't do it, but you will be a smallminded, limited one. Force yourself to listen to radically new things. Although music stores divide their shelves into copious categories, your music should be divided intoonly two generae: what you like and what you don't. The only way you'll enlarge the ""like"" shelf is by running therisk of increasing the ""don't like"" collection as well. Yes, new CDs are expensive, and unless you're an heiress (or heir, for that matter), you probably can't buy large numbers of CDs of unknown quality. Butmusic comes on cassettes, too, and though their sound quality is indeed inferior to compact discs, they are much, much cheaper. If you really want to be hardcore about it, grab yourself a record player from a Goodwill store (there's one on West 79th) and then realize you can frequently get whole albums of potentially fantastic music for four dollars or less. ""But,"" you protest, ""I don't want to be a music geek—l just want to listen to some good tunes now and then."" Fine: use that KaZaA or Morpheus or Audiogalaxy and your infinitely fast Internet connection to try unknown tunes for absolutely free, with no physical effort at all.It's remarkably difficult to make a serious effort to try something totally different: you have to adjust to new conventions, differentsounds and motifs, peculiar styles and instruments. So often, it's just easier to stop the recording, say, 'This is shit!"" and throw it away. But try not to —try to listen again, and"
338,Music Humanities,Core Journal to Be Published Next Spring,23 September 2003,"By Morgan Sellers Columbia Daily Spectator■ The new journal will include exemplary student essays written for Core classesOvadia Labaton, CC 'O5, was sitting in the Core Curriculum office last fall, trying to switch his section of Contemporary Civilization, when he asked Professor Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum, if anyone had ever attempted to anthologize students' papers from Core classes. She said that no serious effort had ever been made. Now, Labaton is the editor-in-chief of the Core Journal, a new annual publication on campus that will highlight superior literary and scholarly work that Columbia students have done for the Core. ""The numbers are compelling.... There are thousands of kids per year taking Literature Humanities, and thousands taking CC. Even if only one percent are writing good papers, that's hundreds of papers. You can't even print that many,"" Labaton said. But Labaton also wants the journal to be more than just a showcase of student work. He aims to create an ""intellectual history"" of the Core.""We're trying to create an intergenerational dialogue and place current Core papers in a greater context,"" he said. ""The journal can be a time capsule, showing what texts were used and what people were saying about them. Papers change as the world changes"" The Core Journal has plans to publish annually, with three to five papers included for each Core course: Lit Hum, CC, Logic & Rhetoric (or University Writing), Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Major Cultures courses. Labaton intends to find out if there are any assignments in the new Science Frontiers Core course that would lend themselves to such a publication. ""If there's writing in it, and especially if there's a fusion of science and philosophy, or other aspects of the Core, then we'll absolutely include it,"" Labaton said. Recent requests for submissions have gone out in e-mails from the class centers and student government In the future, the journal will ask instructors of Core classes torecommend individual papers for publication, as well as announce submission deadlines in their courses. The board is also hoping to get papers from upperclassmen. The journal has a submissions box in the Core office, and it is also accepting submissions through email at corejournal@columbia.edu. The deadline is Oct 3 at 5 p.m. The executive board members—Eva Gardner, CC 'O4; Rebecca Weber, CC 'O5; and Labaton —are in the process of selecting an editorial board from a pool of more than 70 applications. Student response to the journal is varied, perhaps based on experiences with the Core itself. Emily Kadish, CC 'O6, is anxious to read the first issue of the journal. ""I'm a Core junkie,"" she said. ""There are so many people that complain about it, so it's nice that some people admit to liking it in long, written form."" Cara Rachele, CC 'O5, was somewhat skeptical. She claimed that papers written for Core classes are not representative of college work.""The Core produces a lot of bad writing,"" she said. ""If [the essays] really were the best things that came out of the Core, then that would be interesting, but I wouldn't assume that."" But it is that same idea that the Core Journal is hoping to combat. ""If someone who didn't like their CC class picks up the journal and reads a really great CC paper, maybe it will inspire them,"" Gardner said. The three executive board members already have a lot of experience in on-campus publications. Gardner is currently the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Literary Criticism, and Weber holds the same role at the Columbia Political Review.But the three intend the Core Journal to target a broader audience than other undergraduate literary publications on campus. As Labaton pointed out, the papers would be ""in the context of the Core. [The journal] is about the intellectual history and currents of the Core. I hope there will be great literary research, but we're looking at a much wider topic range. Every undergrad in the College, and even some in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, can relate to this."" The journal has received some funding from the office of Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis, and it will apply for the President's and Provosfs Fund, which provides finances for first-time activities that benefit a significant portion of the undergraduate student body. Also, the journal is in the process of applying for recognition by the Activities Board at Columbia. In the next few years, the executive board also hopes to send copies of the journal to prospective students. And they would like to ask distinguished alumni to write reflections on their experiences with various classes.Currently, the only official support being provided by the Core office is the submissions box. However, Gillooly indicated that if the students asked for any editorial or technical assistance, she would do all that she could, saying, ""Student involvement, energy, and ideas should be supported wherever they can be. What I love about the Core is that all these minds are thinking about the same thing at the same time, and [the journal] will lead to even greater sharing of ideas."" - The journal's executive editors hope to publish the first issue in February, a deadline that Gardner called ""ambitious.""'[The journal] is about the intellectual history and currents of the Core.' —Ovadia Labaton, CC 'O5 Editor, Core Journal'We're trying to create an intergenerational dialogue and place current Core papers in context.' —Labaton"
339,Music Humanities,"Despite Trend, CU Students, Professors Free to Date",10 October 2003,"By Joshie Swindler Columbia Daily Spectator■ University of California passed a ban on all sexual or romantic relationships between students and professors.Columbia students and professors are welcome to have consensual sex with one another. For now. A recently-implemented regulation at the University of California's nine campuses completely bans any student-professor relationships that are deemed ""romantic or sexual."" UC is the latest of several universities to adopt an official policy regarding the long-taboo topic, and one of increasing number of schools that are enacting policies forbidding the relationships altogether. But Columbia, as of yet, simply discourages such involvement among students and faculty. The official policy in FACETS states only that these relationships, ""while not expressly prohibited,may prove problematic."" Associate Provost of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Susan Rieger, who presides over what Columbia calls its ""Romantic Relationship Advisory Statement,"" said that Columbia's relatively lax policy ""has been the advisory for a long time."" And while Rieger reviews the policy every year, she doesn't see a need to reform it just yet. ""I know of no movement to change it. You can have very strict rules and still have abuse,"" she said, referring to schools with strict policies such as Yale, Duke, and Stanford. Most major changes at other universities, she said, have been made after a particularly sordid and publicized incident. The FACETS policy states that specific departments may formu-late their own policies regarding consensual sexual relationships, but Rieger said that none have come to her to officially implement one. FACETS cites the ""inherent power differential"" as one of the problematic aspects of a studentfaculty relationship. Due to fears of favoritism or discrimination, many policies insist that once a professor becomes involved with a student, he or she must notify the superior in order to be removed from all academic contact with the student or the student's work. Columbia does ask teachers to remove themselves from academic decisions regarding students they date. Many critics of such regulations nationwide have wondered where the line is drawn, as policies do not offer definitions of dating orromance. According to University ombuds officer Marsha Wagner, ""[The advisory] doesn't say going out for coffee is okay but going out for dinner isn't."" Other criticisms focus on whether a college should attempt ""to protect the integrity of the system,"" as Rieger said, instead of attempting to protect students from themselves. The Daily Californian, UC Berkeley's student newspaper, ran an editorial against the proposition, claiming that the new romantic policy ""portrays students as in need of protection."" Additionally, most students in these relationships are female, adding gender roles into the already-complicated discussion. ""Are we infantilizing [female stu-dents]?"" Rieger asked. Rob Bruce, CC 'O3, is still involved with a woman he met at Columbia —his Music Humanities instructor. She taught his class as a graduate student, and the two became romantically involved after the class had ended. ""I don't think the policy is really there for people like me,"" Bruce said. ""My relationship is different. I pursued her after class. Once the grade has been determined only on the merit of the student's work, no problem."" Teaching assistants such as Bruce's girlfriend do not fit neatly into Columbia's policy, Rieger said, because they are both teachers and students.Several other student-faculty relationships do exist at Columbia, but involved persons refused to comment on their situations or the policy. Sometimes, Rieger and Wagner noted, relationships that sour or never get off the ground can lead to charges of sexual harassment or misconduct. Rieger said her office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action handles several such suits a year. But Reiger said that she doubts that the administration ever learns about most of the relationships between students and professors on campus. ""You're dealing with adults,"" she said. ""Most people tend to lick their wounds and go home."""

342,Music Humanities,A Dialogue on Racism,3 March 2004,"By Laura DurkayHere at Columbia, we value diverse opinions. The past week has seen a debate about racism that affects us all. In light of this debate, please consider the following completely imaginary exchange between a perturbed liberal and an activist protesting against racism. ""Racism is not a problem at Columbia."" At a town hall meeting last Wednesday night, an African-American woman, almost in tears, described how she returned to her room to find ""Nigger go home"" scrawled on her door —at Barnard College. Another black student described how disbelieving administrators asked to see ID when he went to collect an award he had received. They weren't convinced they had the right person. These are just two of dozens of stories that have come out in the past week. Pretending racism doesn't exist while spouting rhetoric about color-blindness is an implicit endorsement of actions like the Columbia College Conservative Club's bake sale. Anyone who claims that racism is not a problem at Columbia has not been paying attention. ""Students of color shouldn't complain. Columbia is much more enlightened than the rest of the country."" Our university touts its reputation as ""the most diverse Ivy."" But Columbia's student body is 7 percent black and 7 percent Latino in a nation that is one quarter black and Latino and a city that is over half nonwhite. President Bollinger, who styles himself ""Mr. Affirmative Action,"" can only mouth watery platitudes about ""tolerance"" when attacks on students of color are launched from his own campus. In six semesters on the history of ""Western Civilization,"" students read the work of only one black author —W.E.B. Dußois—and may listen to jazz if their Music Humanities teacher is so inclined. In an atmosphere were students learn from day one that the history and culture of white Western Europeans is more important than others, is it really surprising that some feel emboldened enough to say and do things that could have come straight out of the Jim Crow South? Columbia has a long tradition of trying to make Morningside Heights as white and affluent as possible, forcing the borders of Harlem east and north to make room for gourmet food shops, doorman-equipped apartment buildings and a luxurious private school. Now Columbia wants to take the next big leap by buying a large chunk of Manhattanville to build a satellite campus. Area residents may be able to serve coffee there for $7.50 an hour. Far from being a bastion of enlight-ened liberal humanism, Columbia may be one of the most racist places in New York City. ""Jeez, lighten up. That cartoon and the CCCC bake sale were ironic. Can't you take a joke?"" Racism only seems trivial and ironic to those who do not have to face it every day. I am furious about these racist incidents, and I am white. Students of color have every right to be absolutely incensed. Recent events have revealed that students of color feel deeply alienated, marginalized, and attacked on this campus. For three days last week, students of color wore signs protesting the fact that they were being silenced. Who now has the gall to tell them to sit down and shut up about race? While you're at it, why not just tell them to move to the back of the classroom so the white students can see? 'You just want a repeat of 1968, when the campus was polarized and students rioted."" Martin Luther King, Jr., in his ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail,"" wrote that ""we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with."" Columbia administrators—and probably some students —would like to see the protests quietly dissolve or get tied up in endless negotiations, investigative committees and special commissions. But it has never been more urgent to fight back. If students had not ""rioted"" in 1968, we would have a segregated gym in Morningside Park. We need to create an atmosphere where speaking out against racism should be seen as the duty of every student, instead of an annoying disruption that interferes with classes. Furthermore, we need an atmosphere where students of color do not feel constantly under attack. Racism at Columbia will not be solved by official statements, token gestures from the administration, or a superficial dialogue about how we can all be nicer to one another. We need real change. Stronger affirmative action policies, more space for students of color on campus, and a more inclusive Core Curriculum would be a good start. We have been silent about these problems for far too long. Now is the time to speak out and to act.The author is a Columbia College senior majoring in history."
343,Music Humanities,Is the Core Really So Eurocentric?,9 April 2004,"By Wm. Theodore de BaryProposals to reexamine, revise, and expand the Core Curriculum, though by no means new, are always in order. If the Core is thought to be Eurocentric, this is because it has been self-critical from the start —the West reassessing where it stood in a larger world—facing large questions with respect to the adequacy of education and civil society to meet the challenges of a changing world and the problems of unprecedented magnitude facing global civilization. The first response to this challenge was the War and Peace Issues course at the end of World War I, which recognized that civilization itself needed to be rescued from the after-effects of the war ostensibly fought to save democracy. ""Peace"" Issues quickly morphed into Contemporary Civilization, with a recognition that contemporary problems were not amenable to the optimistic and simplistic assumptions of those who underestimated the depth and complexity of the problems facing the post-World War I world. A review of these assumptions in greater historical and philosophical depth was what CC undertook. The focus was still on the ""Contemporary,"" however—on public discourse concerning contemporary problems, and in the '3os , '4os, and 'sos, a second year of the CC program, against the background of Western civilization so reassessed, tried to address current political, economic, and social issues in a way related to public policy questions. Had this part of the Core been sustained it would have been a suitable vehicle for study of the ""diversity"" problems now claiming our attention, but the relevant academic departments gradually withdrew from this kind of general education, preferring to devote their scholarly resources to the advancement of their own disciplines on the frontiers of research. The political disruptions of the late '6os and early '7os only made things worse; in the midst of the ideological struggles and extreme fiscal stringencies of those trying years, it was impossible to mount any effective movement among the faculty to counter the centrifugal forces pulling away from the Core. In the meantime those who had led in the establishment of the CC and Humanities programs, like Dean Harry Carman and Mark Van Doren, had advocated a balancing of the Eurocentric tendency by adding parallel courses in the Asian Humanities and Civilizations as well as Asian art and music humanities. This was done in the late [4os and 'sos, and these Asian courses designed for the Core have continued to begiven ever since. Thus the Core as an educational program has not been Eurocentric in principle, but ""core"" being understood simply as ""required courses"" is still largely so. In other words, we have Asian courses designed for the Core, and students who take them have a learning experience similar to CC and Humanities, but with the Major Cultures requirement as it is now defined, these generic ""core"" courses tend to get lost among a menu of departmental courses that amount to little more than a dilettante's smorgasbord. In these circumstances almost nothing has been done (with the exception of the Senior Scholars Program at the Heyman Center) to gradually expand the pioneering Core programs in Asian. Humanities and Civilizations so that more sections would be made available—in other words, to train new faculty to handle Asia in the Core, in the same way that new faculty are initiated into the teaching of CC and Lit Hum. To make matters worse, the expansion of the size of the College student body was unaccompanied by any enhancement of faculty resources for these purposes; thus, the existing shortage was only compounded. If one wishes to remedy the shortcomings of the existing situation, the first thing needed is to recognize, as the College did post-World War I, that there is no ""quick-fix"" to any of the problems of contemporary civilization, including not only those of minorities in the United States, but also those of oppressed and exploited people everywhere. However, such problems have to do with more than diversity alone; they are problems of the value consensus needed to address these challenges—the reevaluation of the core values on the basis of which concerted action might be taken to meet them. No less a consideration are the core values of the traditions represented by those who claim our attention on the grounds of diversity. If we deal with these as the problems of disadvantaged or exploited minorities and make no effort to understand the core values that identify these peoples as worthy of respect—that is, as subjects of value in themselves and not just as ""objects"" of social scientific study—then we are not showing them the respect due to them as human beings—that is, in the same way that we attempt to understand the ""West"" in the humanities. Fortunately we have a base to work from in the case of Asian peoples who have become prominent minorities in the West—East Asians, South Asians, and Middle Easterners — who are represented by classic texts as well as classic worksof art and music, and lend themselves to the same general education treatment as in CC and Humanities. But it is just as important for this groundwork to be done for other minorities and traditions, to identify the core values that define themselves in terms of a common humanity as well as their cultural diversity. No political ""quick-fix"" will accomplish what education alone can do—establish the grounds and terms on which a continuing multicultural dialogue can be developed to address the new problems of a global contemporary civilization. At the Heyman Center, a project has been launched as an experimental model for such a multicultural approach to a core curriculum global in scope. It takes the form of a juniorsenior colloquium (following the model of the Honors Colloquium that had a prominent and much valued place in the earlier Core sequence), dealing with perennial themes of human life and civilization as revealed through major works of both East and West. In the present sequence, the theme is the classic one of Nobility and Civility, issues of leadership and civil society common to all major civilizations. The earlier Colloquium, which had an honored place in the liberal education of former years, should be restored, but now to include major traditions, East and West (something like this, as a matter of historical fact, was attempted experimentally by the classicist Moses Hades and political scientist Herbert Deane in 1948-49). But the same centrifugal forces of academic specialization that led to the attrition of the Core in recent years are still at work. To remedy the situation and meet the new challenges of the twenty-first century will take long-term planning and a commitment of resources for a Core that should extend into the upper college years and indeed to the graduate level and on to a lifetime of learning. The whole idea of a ""core"" is that it deals with central and perennial human issues that should never be out of sight on any level of learning. They should be the subject of a continuing dialogue on value questions that continues alongside of specialized training and research at every stage. The College, which led the way in the twentieth century, would be a good place for both students and faculty to launch this new idea in the twenty-first century.The author is the John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University, Provost Emeritus, and Director of the Heyman Center for the Humanities."
344,Music Humanities,"Strike Begins; 400 Picket on Day One Few Classes Canceled by Graduate Student Strike, But Organizers Enthused",20 April 2004,"Few Classes Canceled by Graduate Student Strike, But Organizers EnthusedBy Rebecca Aronauer and Morgan Sellers Spectator Staff WritersThe shrill whistles and drum beats of the Graduate Student Employees United picket line woke residents on 116 th Street yesterday morning, as hundreds of graduate students, undergraduates, and supporters marched outside Columbia University's Broadway gates demanding union recognition for research and teaching assistants. But after the first day of the indefinite strike, the effects on undergraduate classes remained unclear. The picket lines lasted from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. A New York Police Department officer estimated that 400 to 500 marched over the course of the morning. At noon, members of various other unions on campus joined the picket lines, and the strikers then marched in the gates and around campus. Strike organizers said they were pleased with the turnout. ""For the first day of the strike, it was great,"" said David Carpio, GSEU spokesman and former Columbia graduate student. ""I think the rally we had at the end really energized the teaching and research assistants. We're ready for day two."" Inside the gates, however, it was difficult to determine the extent of the strike's effect. Many department chairs are asking TAs to notify them if they will be striking, but many had not yet responded. The number of cancelled sections of core classes appeared low, but no numbers were available from University Writing, the class that administrators and the Core office estimated would be most affected. No Monday/Wednesday Music Humanities sections were canceled because of the strike, and only a few Art Humanities sections were canceled yesterday afternoon. Finals for all core classes will be held. Art Humanities director Robert Harrist does not know precisely howmany Tuesday/Thursday sections will meet, but thinks the number will be high. ""For tomorrow, I think it's looking pretty good,"" he said. Only three of 23 Literature Humanities precepts are confirmed as striking, but four have not responded to Core Director Eileen Gillooly's inquiries. Contemporary Civilization has had higher returns: there are four definite striking precepts of 23 and Gillooly is waiting to hear back from eight others. The administration and directors had little time to make alternate arrangements for the strike; three days after the results of the vote were announced, the graduate students went on strike. But Gillooly does not think more time would have made a difference. ""Strikes are intended to inconvenience. I'm not sure whether there is ever enough time to plan effectively for a strike,"" Gillooly wrote in an email. First-years, who tend to take the most courses taught by precepts, like core and language classes, will likely be most affected by the strike. Dahlia Runco, CC 'O7, had two classes canceled: Italian and University Writing. While she said she appreciates the unanticipated free time, she is worried about how the strike will leave her class unprepared for exams. ""I'm glad that we have time off, but it puts us at a disadvantage for the final,"" Runco said. Many of the strikers expressed similar regrets about canceling classes. Susan Kart, a graduate student in the Art History department will not teach her Art Humanities class for the duration of the strike. ""I started talking to my class last week about contingency plans,"" she said. ""A lot of the students told me that they were concerned about missing class. I told them that we are all disappointed too ... I'd rather be in class teaching Picasso."" But she, along with hundreds of other teaching and research assistants, demonstrated that the issues at stake were important enough to justify their actions. Many of those walking the picket line said that one of their most important reasons for striking was showing support of their fellow graduate students. Zane Mackin, a second-year graduate student in the Italian department, said that he had a good relationship with the Italian department, and was uncertain about a union before considering its poten-tial benefits to other graduate students. ""Of course I feel ambivalent, because I can make ends meet,"" he explained. But he said that many graduate students had to work extra jobs in order to cover their living expenses and that there were no guarantees regarding stipends, health benefits, or other aspects of graduate student life. Mackin also said that he was concerned about what he perceived as an increasing corporate atmosphere at Columbia. ""There isn't a lot of space for free intellectual exercise anymore,"" he said. Many of the protesters carried signs picturing Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Henry Pinkham, and included a quote from a meeting with English graduate students in which he called GSAS a ""moneysink."" ""It's telling that he's using the terms of the corporation rather than the terms of the university,"" Mackin said. ""What he calls a sinkhole, we call a salary."" But some fear that a union would only hurt the relationship betweengraduate students and faculty. ""Another level of bureaucracy is the last thing in the world that Columbia needs,"" Paul Sheehan, a third-year graduate student in the Music department said. Sheehan, who is continuing to teach his Music Humanities class, said that GSEU had not adequately addressed the effects of a union on the ""intangibles"" of graduate student studies. ""I don't know if a union would be good for us or not,"" Sheehan said, ""but I doubt the sincerity of the union."" Other students are convinced that a union would not be appropriate at Columbia. Adam Meshel, a fifth-year graduate student in the Biological Sciences department, was one of the organizers for Graduate Students Against Unionization, a student group that campaigned opposite GSEU during the debates leading up to the unionization vote two years ago. ""How can you take the concern of a student who is in the English department and compare it with someone in biology?"" he asked. 'To think that you can write a contract that can address all those needs is asking too much."" But Meshel agreed that the votes from two years ago should have been counted. ""We're just as upset at the University for locking up those votes as GSEU is,"" he said. ""If it turned out that the vote had gone infavor of a union, I would back up 100 percent."" GSEU last talked to Senior Executive Vice President Robert Kasdin nine months ago about the University dropping the appeal to the National Labor Relationship Board that has prevented the 2002 ballots from being counted. President Lee Bollinger did not reply to State Senator David Paterson's letter confirming that a majority of TAs and RAs had signed union authorization cards and asking the University to withdraw its appeal. Provost Alan Brinkley did try to set up an appointment with the senator, but no meeting materialized. The administration did not realize that after Paterson's letter, GSEU's next step would be a strike. ""I realized that the issue would become a live issue again on campus. There was nothing in the letter to suggest a strike. I just didn't think this was the likely result,"" Brinkleysaid. After the first day of striking, there are no plans for a meeting between the administration and GSEU. Administrators have already rejected GSEU's demands for union recognition, a third party union authorization card count or withdrawing their appeal to the NLRB. ""We're not really in a negotiation situation. The union is asking that we drop our appeal and that's not something the administration is willing to do,"" Brinkley said. ""There's no middle ground between these positions."" Brinkley said that if approached, the administration would be willing to talk to GSEU and is waiting for them to end the strike. ""It's their decision,"" he said. However, GSEU organizers hope that the strike will convince the University to reevaluate its position. The picket line will continue today, and on Wednesday the undergraduate group Students for Environmental and Economic Justice is calling for a school wide boycott of classes and a rally on the Low steps at noon.'Another level of bureaucracy is the last thing in the world that Columbia needs.' —Paul Sheehan Third-year graduate studentWith forces that numbered from around 100 to 200 people at any given time during the day, striking graduate students marched across campus in a demonstration against the University. Various departments including anthropology, mathematics, and English and comparative literature were represented in the brightly colored signs carried by students who quoted everyone from Immanuel Kant to Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Henry Pinkham. The protesters plan to return to the picket lines tomorrow morning and continue indefinitely."
345,Music Humanities,Curtain! Music Hum Drops Hour Per Week Next Year's Classes to Run Three Hours Per Week Instead of Four,21 April 2004,"Next Year's Classes to Run Three Hours Per Week Instead of FourBy Molly Melican Spectator Staff WriterThose students who've avoided taking Masterpieces of Western Music —more commonly known as Music Hum—just got lucky. Starting next fall, the mandatory Core Curriculum class will be shortened to only three hours a week, as opposed to the current four. ""I'm stoked,"" Paasha Mahdavi, CC 'O6, said. 'The change, according to Walter Frisch, chair of the Music Humanities department, has been under discussion for some time now. ""Within the department we've been thinking for a while ... whether four hours was the most effective way to teach the class,"" Frisch said.""Many people's listening now is structured online,"" he said. The four hours, he explained, was originally necessary for students to have a chance to listen to the music. Modern technology makes the extra hour unnecessary, he said. Frisch also said he hoped the total hours students spend listening to the music will not be affected. ""I agree it's ridiculous that it is an hour and 50 minutes,"" Katie Beaudette, CC 'O6, who is taking the course this semester, said, ""but I'm currently living through that and I think everyone else should have to too."" The course, which has in the past been the only four-hour per week core course not worth four credits, will continue to be worth three credits. ""One of our goals with the new model is to bring the contact hours into line with the credits awarded,"" Frisch said. In addition, Frisch noted that the department will implement a new program to train graduate students to teach the course. Currently, the ""listening assistants"" —graduate students being trained to teach Music Hum—teach for one hour a week under the auspices of four or five different professors throughout the year. The new program will allow students-in-training to work with only one professor or advanced graduate student each semester. While Frisch stressed that these new teaching assistants would not be grading or writing exams, he did point out that the new training will give graduate students more experience. ""They will be much more integrally working with one professor,"" said Frisch. ""The idea is to make these apprenticeships more effective."" For all those still holding out on taking the course, consider yourself warned: the new hours will come under examination in January, 2005, according to Frisch.Music Humanities instructor Joshua Cody reclines on a piano while lecturing."
346,Music Humanities,GSEU Picketing Continues Undergraduate Walkout and Rally to Take Place on Low Steps at Noon,21 April 2004,"Undergraduate Walkout and Rally to Take Place on Low Steps at NoonBy Morgan Sellers Spectator Staff WriterThe striking graduate students began to settle in for the long haul yesterday as they protested on College Walk, in sharp contrast to the students and teachers who lounged on the steps of Low Library enjoying the warm Spring weather.Between 60 and 80 teaching and research assistants joined the picket lines yesterday. The turnout corresponded to the participation level that strike organizers expected to see over the long term. ""If everyone showed up all day, every day, we wouldn't last very long,"" said David Carpio, an organizer for the Graduate Student Employees Unite, the organization that is calling for the strike. The effect of the strike onundergraduate classes remains unclear. Carpio said that the total number of striking graduate students will not be known for at least a week. According to Eileen Gilooly, the director of the Core, four Literature Humanities teaching assistants and eight graduate student Contemporary Civilizations teachers are currently on strike. Yesterday, Dean Chris Colombo e-mailed the families of undergraduates, informingthem that the University was taking the necessary steps to ensure ""that students are able to complete the semester."" An undergraduate walk-out and rally organized by the Students for Environmental and Economic Justice will cause the effects of the strike to become increasingly apparent today. The rally will take place at noon on Low Steps. Meanwhile, the debate that began over two years ago about the benefits of unionization at Columbia Continues. Some of the teaching and research assistants that are not striking emphasized the point that GSEU was only representing a portion of the graduate students. ""Not everyone is in favor of the union,"" said Johanna Seasonwein, a third year graduate student in Art History. ""It's very important to me to say that I don't agree."" ""I don't see a role for unions at universities,"" she said. ""I feel very strongly that my role here is as an apprentice teacher and not as a laborer."" ""People don't like to think of their work as graduate students as work that needs to be organized,"" said Michael Palm, a graduate student at NYU who had come to support the strike. Carpio agreed. ""It's a misconception that unions are only necessary for blue collar or low income workers. Unions are good for anyone who has a boss in this country, and wants to have a say. A union is a simple thing,"" he said. ""It's not such a radical idea."" Seasonwein also pointed to the support that Columbia currently gives graduate students. ""I get all my tuition paid for, access to subsidized housing,health coverage, subsidized dental care ... and I get extra grants for summertime research,"" she said. ""I don't see what the problems are. Getting paid to study is a privilege."" Karina Attar, a graduate student in the Italian department, agreed that the benefits of a graduate school education are tremendous, but decided to go on strike regardless. ""I am grateful as a graduate student,"" she said,""but quality of life and intellectual growth are two different things. Nobody here is trying to make $150,000 a year. We're just trying to have a reasonable quality of life. We're the educators of the next generation."" According to Henry Pinkham, dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Sciences, graduate education at Columbia University has been transformed over the past thirty years through the slow development of new methods of funding, and especially since the gradual introduction of a full-fund-ing plan starting in 1996. Currently, in any semester that a graduate student is a teaching fellow, a graduate student receives a stipend—sl7,ooo in 2003-2004 in addition to a full tuition fellowship, for a total value that Pinkham estimated at $50,000 per year. Many students also receive stipends during semesters in which they are not teaching or performing research. Pinkham said that the drive for the increase in funding came primarily from competition with peer institutions. ""If we had not done this, we would no longer have been able to attract top students,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""In terms of funding we are fully competitive with all but perhaps two or three Ph.D. programs in the United States."" Some graduate students say that it's not enough to trust the University. ""You need a voice that does not get its authority from the University itself,"" said Theresa Ventura, a third-year graduate student in the history department. ""There is nothing guaranteeing that the next years of incoming graduate students will have the same package."" Carpio said that many students were overly caught up in predicting the details of possible scenarios that could confront a union and were consequently left frightened by unionization. ""It's paralysis by analysis,"" he said. 'The details come in at the level of the bargaining table."" But for some graduate students, those details are essential in deciding whether or not to supportthe union. Morgan Mihok, a first-year graduate student in the Chemistry department, said that she was reluctant to take a stand because she felt that there were a lot of questions that hadn't been addressed. ""I need more information before I can feel like I am being represented,"" Mihok said. She explained that because so much of the debate took place two years ago, many current students are not informed about the potential benefits or disadvantages of a union. ""The groundwork here may have been done, but it has not been presented to me,"" she said. Mihok said that most of her information had come from talking with GSEU members individually or during rallies and protests. Other graduate students have complained about GSEU's grassroots method of organizing. This approach consisted primarily of contacting graduate students individually throughout the academic year. GSEU members offered graduate students the opportunity to sign union authorization cards that stated that they authorized UAW to ""represent them in collective bargaining"" and to use their names in support of the union. Carpio said that he felt GSEU organizers had done a good job of reaching out to their supporters, and educating other graduate students over the past year. ""When someone says they don't want to be contacted, we don't contact them. Likewise, if they say come back later, we do,"" he said. In addition to concerns about"
347,Music Humanities,"Demanding Right to Form Union, Graduate Students Begin Strike Dispute Over Impounded Ballots and Desire for Graduate Student Union Leads Graduate Student Employees Unite Group o Strike; University Maintains Anti-Union Stance While Attempting to Minimize Negative Impact on Undergraduates",12 May 2004,"Dispute Over Impounded Ballots and Desire for Graduate Student Union Leads Graduate Student Employees Unite Group o Strike; University Maintains Anti-Union Stance While Attempting to Minimize Negative Impact on UndergraduatesBy Rebecca Aronauer Spectator Staff WriterFor the past four weeks, Graduate Student Employees United members have marched outside the Broadway gates demanding one thing: the right to vote for a union. After countless canceled classes and altered finals, the administration and GSEU remain at impasse. The strike's success is difficult to measure. When GSEU announced the strike, administrators had already decided that it would continue to wait for the National Labor Relations Board's ruling and not allow a graduate student vote on unionization. Four weeks of chants and marches in and around Low Library have not changed the administration's policy, and the administration and GSEU have never met formally to discuss an agreement. Despite the absent TAs, most professors have followed University Provost Alan Brinkley's mandate that all students receive grades. As the strike progressed, many precepts returned to the classroom from the picket line. In University Writing, Director Joseph Bizup originally thought a great majority of the precepts were striking, but said that number has fluctuated to less than half. For some core classes like Art Hum and Music Hum, directors were able to cover the classes of striking precepts. But even without a tangible victory, like a card count or the University withdrawing its appeal from NLRB, GSEU still considers the strike a success. ""We thought the strike was great,"" said David Carpio, a GSEU spokesman and former Columbia biology graduate student. The strike created a heightened awareness about GSEU's cause. Over 50 professors signed a letter to University President Lee Bollinger urging him to allow the graduate students to vote on unionization. Columbia clerical workers and undergraduates marched with graduate students. On the eighth day of the strike, hundreds of protesters and GSEU supports came out to hear John Sweeny, the president of the AFL-CIO, speak in favor of a graduate student vote on unionization. The strike has been featured in The New York Times three times, and was the subject of a New Yorker 'Talk of the Town""piece. 'The union campaign is significantly stronger due to the strike,"" Carpio said. ""The strike has strengthened and the support for a TA/RA union."" As the semester ends, the strike may not. If the NLRB does not rule this summer on Columbia's appeal to a ruling that graduate students and undergraduate students working as teaching assistants were employees of the University, GSEU may continue its strike in the fall. ""We're determined to get union recognition. We'll do anything we can to get it,"" Carpio said. If the strike does continue into the fall, the administration will not rescind its appeal and allow the ballots from 2002 vote on unionization to be counted. The University will also not agree to a new graduate student card count on unionization. ""There's been no change in the University's policy,"" Brinkley said. The NLRB has indicated that it will decide on Columbia's case, as well as similar appeals from the University of Pennsylvania, Tufts, and Brown soon. Last April, David Parker, the board's deputy executive secretary, told The New York Times that the University's case was under consideration and would be decided in a matter of months. The lack of a NLRB ruling has also impeded officially deciding if a majority of graduate students want a union. The board impounded graduate and applicable undergraduate students' votes in 2002, and the ballots are still uncounted. The NLRB delay created another split between the administration and GSEU: those who will wait for the board's ruling, and those won't. 'We've been more patient [than GSEU],"" said Henry Pinkham, the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science. ""We fully expected to have a decision a long time ago."" When the appeal process began, GSEU staged a two-day walkout in May to pressure the University to drop its case. The walkout cancelled three-fifths of Logic & Rhetoric (the predecessor to University Writing) classes on its firstday, but Columbia continued with its ase. In April 2003, GSEU held ""Free the Box Ballot Box"" rally on Low Steps. Members of GSEU see the patience as indicative of their anti-union stance ""They're completel; stonewalling us right now,"" Maurice Leutenegger, a physics graduate studmt, sa id last February. Eager to prove that a majority of gaduate students wanted a union during the lengthy appeal, GSEU collected uiion authorization cards from teaching and research assistants. In March, few York State Senate Minority leader David A. Paterson counted the cards aid that GSEU had a majority. Paterson did not release the exact lumber of 'authorization cards he counted nor is an exact count of eligible TVs or RAs available. And though hundreds have protested during the pas four weeks, it is still possible that a majority of graduate students do not vant to unionize. i n the buildup to the 2002 vote on unionization, a group )f anti-unionization graduate students formed called Graduate Student Agaiist Unionization. GSAU disbanded after the election and the appeal, but anti-uiion seqtiiment amongst graduate students still exists. ""I am concerned that if a union cones on campus, it will further alienate graduate students from the universiy administration, the faculty, and the undergraduates,"" art history graduatestudent Jody Sieasonwein wrote in an email. Pro-union graduate students at Conell were confident tihat they win would the first union ballot in the Ivy Leagie in October 2002, but 70 percent of Cornell graduate students voted agaiist unionization. But GSEU is confident that two-ye.r old ballots now i a t NLRB office show that a majority wants a union. ""We wouldn't be fighting so hard \ v^ e didn't think we won the election,"" Leutenegger said. Whether or not GSEU has a mjority, its strike has had impact on Columbia. Core Directors estimate hat the strike affected four Literature Humanities sections, five Art Humaiities sections, between eight and 12Contemporary Civilization sections, two Music Humanities sections, and a little under half of the University Writing sections. The day after GSEU announced the strike, Brinkley posted a press release on the Columbia Web site saying he would prioritize minimizing the strike's disruption to the University and ensuring all students received grades. ""Ensuring that every student receives credit for academic work this semester is a core and irrevocable commitment of the University,"" Brinkley wrote. The clash between the indefinite strike and the administration's determination to have students receive credit for their classes this semester have left some undergraduates feeling torn between their education and support for the strike. ""I can't say that we've succeeded in avoiding all disruption,"" Brinkley said. ""[The students] are caught, and I regret that."" Contemporary Civilizations, the class most affected by the strike after University Writing, has especially frustrated sophomores. Eileen Gillooly, the director of the Core Curriculum, organized two review sessions during class hours two weeks ago, and students of striking precepts took a universal final last Friday. One CC precept who held class off campus in the last weeks of the semester said, ""The administration has immunized itself by demanding that all students receive grades."" Some CC students petitioned the final and requested incompletes for the semester. An incomplete for any student because of the strike would have breached Brinkley's demand for all students to receive credit for the semester, so Gilooly did not give those students incompletes but did allow them to take the exam pass/fail. Petition organizers like Brian Ruby, SEAS 'O6, distributed stickers during last Friday's final for students to put on their blue books, saying that the exam ""compromises the academic integrity of my Contemporary Civilization experience."" ""Whatever complaints we had about the CC final would have been tenfold,one hundred-fold, if we postponed the exam until the fall."" Brinkley said. ""Neither option wad ideal. But I think the option was we choose was the right choice."" The strike has forced professors of large lectures to grade many papers and finals themselves. Faced with the daunting task of grading hundreds of exams, some professors have made finals multiple-choice or altogether optional. DeWitt Clinton Professor of History Eric Foner taught U.S. Era of Civil War and Reconstruction this semester, a lecture with more than 150 students. Without the majority of his TAs, Foner must grade over 100 final papers and exams. Though he supports the graduate students' right to vote on a union, he said he felt conflicted between supporting the graduate students and teaching his undergraduate students during the closing weeks of the semester. 'The union is asking us to choose between our graduate and undergraduate students,"" Foner said. In September, Columbia students may return to the now familiar sight of protesters on Broadway, a graduate student union, or continued tension between the administration and graduate students. But no matter what happens this summer, the results on the education world will be enormous. The GSEU action this semester marked the first indefinite strike in the Ivy League. The strike's success in rallying community, faculty, and student support and its failure to change the administration's policy will be an example to both graduate students and administrators at schools where students are struggling to form unions, like Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Tufts. Robert Barchi, the provost at Penn, condemned the GSEU strike. The NLRB impounded Penn graduate student votes on unionization in 2003 after a university-initiated appeal. ""Every victory brings about energy and the sense of possibility to every campus,"" said Mary Reynolds, a Yale graduate student in American studies and a spokeswoman for Yale's Graduate Student Employees Organization."
348,Music Humanities,Core Curriculum Sees Major Changes University Writing Replaces Logic and Rhetoric; New Course Tested for Science Requirement; Music Hum Loses An Hour,12 May 2004,"University Writing Replaces Logic and Rhetoric; New Course Tested for Science Requirement; Music Hum Loses An HourBy Anjali Dayal Spectator Staff WriterColumbia College's vaunted Core Curriculum underwent an ideological renovation this year. University Writing officially supplanted Logic and Rhetoric with a more research-oriented focus. Music Humanities lost an hour with a nod to the altered exigencies of scheduling and technology. And, above all else, Frontiers of Science swept a collective scientific experience into the futures of all incoming Columbia students, while crowding out the sequence requirement for all current students. In a year when student protestors on Low Plaza wore signs that read ""I am being silenced because the Core is exclusive,"" and the Committee on Instruction approved the comparative ethnic studies major after years of deliberation, changes to the core, especially the addition of both University Writing and Frontiers of Science, reflected changes in instructional philosophy. ""Both changes remind us that the core, since its inception in the early twentieth century, continues to be defined by debates over its very structure and substance, and it is only within a tradition of such debates that this respected curriculum can have something to say to our students of the 21st century,"" Kathryn Yatrakis, the College's dean of academic affairs, wrote in an e-mail. The first and smallest of these changes is Music Hum's reformatting. The course dropped one hour weekly in acknowledgment of the digital age, and in acknowledge-ment of the fact that students no longer have to do their listening in class. This is, Yatrakis wrote, ""a one-year experiment in ... which the listening component has been incorporated into the regular course time rather than in an additional hour devoted to listening. The Committee on the Core and the Committee on Instruction will be evaluating this change to determine whether Music Humanities should be organized this way going forward."" First taught in pilot form last year, University Writing replaced the purely expository focus of L&R with a new emphasis on research, longer writing assignments, and assigned reading in scholarly texts, including Edward Said's Orientalism and Michel Foucault's ""Panopticism."" Whereas L&R took students' writing as the texts of the course, University Writing aims ""to inculcate [in students] a habit of mind [that will enable them] ... to wrestle with intellectual uncertainties,"" and to place the intricacies of research at the forefront of their introduction to higher education, as Joseph Bizup, associate professor of English and Comparative Literature, and director and creator of University Writing, told Spectator in February. ""Real research is driven by real questions,"" he said. L&R suffered from a lack of clear budget and from chronic underfunding. Its founder, Professor of English Edward Tayler, based his syllabus on Amherst College's English I course, which was similarly focused on student writing. L&R's demise brought University Writing's expanded effort to placecomposition within the context of the rest of the college. Frontiers of Science is the culmination of a 20-year effort to do the same for science. The course, which ran in pilot form this year, will debut next year as a requirement for all incoming first-years. ""Since I first proposed this in 1983, I'm very pleased that we've finally reached the point where Columbia recognizes that science has been one of the major contributions of Western civilization that our Core focuses on, for whatever reason,"" said David Helfand, astronomy department chair and an architect of the course, in an April interview. The course, as it will redebut next year, is a combination of weekly course-wide lectures given by faculty eminent in their research fields; weekly seminars administered by those faculty and post-doctorate students called Columbia Science Fellows; and some field work. Frontiers will also incorporate a heavily interactive approach to science instruction. In fact, starting next year, the entire 550 person lecture will begin a five to 10 year research project that, Helfand said, ""will have major implications for the biodiversity of the city."" Issues surrounding the course have been its implication for science majors, its level of instruction, and its effects on the instruction of other science at Columbia. All incoming College students will be required to take the course, regardless of their major, although some deferrals until sophomore year will be granted. The course, said Darcy Kelley, professor of biology and another of Frontiers' originators, will be interdisciplinary and broadly-based in order to address the diverse knowledge levels of its students. She noted that Columbia science students would certainly benefit from taking science courses with non-scientists. ""You're going to be asked to present your science to policymakers ... you can play the science and humanities aspects off each other and answer questions like, how would you frame your science to make decisions?"" Kelley said. Science fellow Robin Herrnstein, who is currently facilitating a focus group of students who took the course this year, asserted the logic of requiring science students to take the course. ""This course would have been great for me. I'm a better scientist for knowing something about the current state of neurobiology or genetics, which I didn't before picking up this course."" ""It adds to the collective experience of Columbia—everyone doing science together."" Herrnstein said. Both Frontiers of Science and the alterations in Music Hum indicate a new empha-sis on assessing changes to the core curriculum. Indeed, Frontiers has already been revised as the result of student input. Student evaluations of Frontiers, Helfand said, indicated that ""They like the lectures, they like the seminars, they didn't like the course ... They weren't clear what our goals were."" ""We really made a mistake by not outlining course goals. ""It was sort of foolish of us to think they'd know, coming out of high school with a different model of science instruction."" Helfand said. He said he would rectify this by giving an introductory lecture elucidating these goals at the start of each semester. Other parts of the science requirement have been decollectivized. The Committee on Science Instruction also abolished the sequence requirement for all current students. These sequences did not fulfill their stated commitment to enhancing the depth of student knowledge, as Yatrakis and Helfand noted, because many students did not register in sequence. ""Science has become much more interdisciplinary, so taking a sequence in, say, chemistry may no longer be enough to get you depth. The idea that you could only gain depth by focusing in one discipline is no longer valid,"" Kelley added. How all these changes will ultimately effect the instruction of science at Columbia is still in the air. ""It's an empirical question—we'll know at the end of five years whether or no we have more or fewer science majors,"" Helfand said. The framers of Frontiers are, however, hoping to alter Columbia's attitude towards the sciences, making it more of the same collective experience that other aspects of the College's undergraduate curriculum hold, Herrnstein said.The Core Curriculum, the series of courses required for all Columbia College students that dates back to 1919, underwent a series of changes this year.PBS.

349,Music Humanities,"Graduates Honor 'Great Teachers' CC's Hood, SEAS's Shahabuddin, and Core's Smit Win Teaching Awards",30 September 2004,"CC's Hood, SEAS's Shahabuddin, and Core's Smit Win Teaching AwardsBy Josie Swindler Spectator Staff WriterThe Society of Columbia Graduates awarded its two latest Great Teacher Awards last night to psychology professor Donald Hood and industrial engineering and operations research professor Perwez Shahabuddin. History professor Jacob W. Smit received special recognition for his dedication to the Core Curriculum. Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Zvi Galil and Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley spoke briefly before Society President Paul A. de Bary, CC '6B, announced the winners. Quigley told the crowd of approximately 150, mostly alumni from the 1940s through the 19605, that ""greatteaching is in fact quite a mystical experience"" for both students and teachers. ""Great teaching is an enormous intellectual challenge,"" he said. Hood, the James F. Bender professor of psychology, has taught at Columbia for more than three decades. In 1993 the Columbia College Student Council gave him the Mark van Doren Award for Outstanding Teaching. From 1982 to 1987, he was the vice president for Arts and Sciences. Telling the crowd that students have changed only superficially in his 35 years at Columbia, Hood said, ""There's more metal hanging from different parts of the body ... more holes drilled ... more baseball caps, especially facing the wrong way."" But he emphasized that students are as intellectually aggressive as ever, and that Columbia outshines its peers inthat respect. Shahabuddin has only been at Columbia since 1994, and was not made a full professor until January 2004. He came to Columbia from his native India by way of Stanford. Before teaching at Columbia he conducted research for IBM. Shahabuddin said he longed to enter academia because ""I was missing interacting with young minds ... their enthusiasm ... their idealism."" He won one of the first Distinguished Faculty Teaching Awards from the Columbia Engineering School Alumni Association. Shahabuddin, who has a slight speech impediment, said, ""Despite my stuttering I do manage to connect with my students. ... There is something mystical in that connection."" He praised his students forgiving him a chance to prove himself based on content rather than judging him by his first lecture. Since the Core's inception nearly 60 years ago, Smit has been one the few people to ever teach all four of its major classes: Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities, which he says he did because hecouldn't decide what to be when he grew up. ""My life would become totally empty without having [students] around me constantly,"" Smit said. Following the awards and the brief acceptance speeches, Middle East and Asian languages and cultures professor George Saliba presented a PowerPoint lecture entitled ""Arabic Science and the Making of the Renaissance Europe.""The ceremony, held in Low Rotunda, was the 56th Great Teacher Awards Dinner sponsored by the Society, and the Society's 95th annual meeting. Previous award winners include Mark Van Doren in 1949, Lionel Trilling in 1955, William Theodore de Bary in 1970, James B. Shenton in 1976, Eric Foner in 1991, Kenneth Jackson in 1999, and Alan Brinkley in 2003.Engineering professor Perwez Shahabuddin and psychology professor Donald Hood wait to receive their Great Teacher Awards.Donald Hood was one of two professors honored last night with a Great Teacher Award."
350,Music Humanities,"The Major Problems Of Major Cultures Hans, Solo Gautam Hans",14 October 2004,"Hans, Solo Gautam HansOkay people. Today I'm going to tell you a short tale about this giant dysfunctional family called the Core Curriculum. Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities are the parents, Art and Music Hum. are the teenage twins, University Writing and Frontiers of Science are the bratly five-year-olds, and the science and foreign language requirements are the crazy relatives who come by every so often to make your life miserable. But life is more or less happy and integrated in the Core family, though they seem to talk about Western European culture a lot. Then one day they find out that they have some long-lost cousins who are going to stay with them from now on. These two cousins, known as Major Cultures, are young, and they think that they can make a difference in the world by teaching people about each other's lives and backgrounds. But after a few months the pair, who have been ignored by the Core family, become disillusioned, and eventually everyone else stops paying attention to what they're trying to say. The Major Cultures requirement was instituted in the 1980s to increase global awareness in the Core and answer long-standing complaints that the Core was biased in favor of Dead White Males. According to the Columbia College Bulletin, ""the Major Cultures requirement promotes learning and thought about the variety of civilizations and the diversity of traditions that have formed the world and continue to interact in it today."" In theory, the Major Cultures requirement sounds like a great idea: engage students in the world beyond the U.S. and Western Europe by making them take classes that focus on civilizations worldwide. Whether or not that actually works is a matter of opinion. Major Cultures is hampered by an extremely complex and frustrating hierarchical system (which is hardly surprising, given Columbia's love of confusing its students about academic regulations) that places classes in three different categories: Lists A, B, and C. Every student has to start with a class from List A, and the second class can either be any List A class or a List B or C class from the same civilization as the first List A class. And the List B/C class has to be taken after the List A class. Confused yet? So, why does Columbia make students jump through hoops to open their minds? There's no guarantee that a student will retain any relevant cultural knowledge after the class is complete. Unlike Lit. Hum. and Contemporary Civilization, which have their own departments and aren't geared toward specific majors, many Major Cultures courses are advanced courses in departments where the intention is not to increase cultural awareness for the novice. Having taken two literature classes for my Major Cultures requirement— Colloquium on East Asian Texts and Latin American Hum—l feel that Columbia could both vastly simplify the requirement and ensure that students are actually learning something. Instead of having multilayered List classes, the easiest solution would be to emulate the Lit. Hum.-Contem-porary Civilization-Art/Music Hum. model. By making each student take a literature or history class on one civilization and an art history or music class on another, a new Major Cultures requirement would be much easier to understand and also tie into existing Core classes. Since every student takes Lit. Hum. and Contemporary Civilization, a literature or history class would be a natural extension of the themes and ideas that get stuffed down our throats our first two years here. An art or music class would similarly tie into Art and/or Music Humanities. Such a scheme would preserve the element of choice in Major Cultures while also making it easier to determine what counts and what doesn't. And by incorporating the requirement more into its structure, perhaps the Core can finally accept Major Cultures into its dysfunctional family.Gautam Hans is a Columbia College junior majoring in English."
351,Music Humanities,"Expensive Tuition, Free Artwork Columbia Aims to Increase Student Access to City's Cultural Institutions",10 December 2004,"Columbia Aims to Increase Student Access to City's Cultural InstitutionsBy NoorZaidi Spectator Staff WriterCost of watching cheesy biopic Alexander. $lO. Average club cover charge: $2O. Amount spent on a nice dinner in New York: too much. Standing in front of Van Gogh's Starry Night: priceless—literally. At least, that's the kind of feeling Columbia and the surrounding cultural institutions in New York are hoping to instill in students, as attempts continue to make museums and performing arts more accessible and attractive to college students. Offering an abundance of optionsto choose from—including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center, the Guggenheim Museum, and the New York Philharmonic—University administrators say they want students to explore the diverse cultural life of the city and take advantage of an increasing amount of low-price incentives. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Modern Art are all free for students with CUIDs. Music institutions provide special discounted tickets, called student rush tickets, the morning of the performance. Carnegie Hall, the Metropoli-tan Opera, and the New York Philharmonic all offer such tickets. Walter Frisch, chair of Music Humanities, said that students are actively utilizing reduced pricing policies. ""Rush tickets do require some initiative from students. But I think the number of institutions that are giving good deals, even if it isn't specific to Columbia, is increasing and I think students are taking advantage,"" Frisch said. Director of University Arts Initiative Gregory Mosher agreed. ""Some of these art museums and collectionshave very enlightened prices,"" he said. ""I think ifs probably because those places realize that it's really smart to get young people looking at art, and if they like it now, they'll come back and look. If you're running an arts institution, you're just nuts if you don't get the young people in. Because the Met is publicly funded, it does not require admission at all but has a $l5 suggested entry fee. The Whitney and MoMA museums don't receive money from Columbia, but allow Columbia students free admission. But Mosher acknowledged that many performing arts institutions do not currently make an adequate effort to attract students. ""Some of them have absurd student polices. You go down at like three in the morning to try to get student rush tickets, stand in a long line, sing your school song, completely ruin your day, then you might just get let in,"" he said. Efforts to engage students in the richness of New York cultural lifebegan with the additions of Art and Music Humanities to the Core Curriculum in 1947. The courses aim to acquaint Columbians with a way of critically appreciating the art world. ""I think it's great that some students that had little exposure to visual arts, by the end of the semester are very much involved in the art world,"" said Zainab Bahrani, Art Humanities chai. In addition, according to Deborah Martinsen, acting director of the Core Curriculum, the University recently bought a membership to the New York City Opera so that students could attend at a highly subsidized rate. Students are now given a choice of where they prefer to sit and pay according to a pricing tier, whereas in previous years the only option was in the cheapest section. While the two courses are required for graduation and expect students to devote some time to visiting museums or attending musical performances, the University is attempting to promote the exploration of the arts for students beyond the Core. Mosher acknowledged that for many students, the greatest impedi-ment of taking fuller advantage of the city comes from lack of information. ""You know it's all out there, but how do you access it?"" Mosher said. ""Those are the things that people keep saying. By the time you get all the information, you think, 'Screw it, IH go to the West End and have a beer.'"" Though he was hesitant to reveal any details, Mosher said he is currently in the process of putting together a large cultural package that would increase ticket access for Columbians. ""It's central to me that for all the historians and the French majors and the law students and everybody else, this program exists for them,"" Mosher said. However, there are those city-sawy Columbians like Lucy Plumb-Reyes, CC 'O7, who already rely on their desire to explore New York to enjoy new experiences. ""There are the student deals for incredible things that are really accessible—that is, if people ever leave campus. I'd feel foolish if I didn't. From the get-go, I chose Columbia not for Butler and the Core, but rather for places like Lincoln Center.""A CUID gains entry to the newly opened MOMA and other museums for free as part of Columbia's emphasis on student involvement In the arts."
352,Music Humanities,"Shorter Music Hum Garners Rave Reviews Less Class Time Does Not Allow for as Much In-Class Listening, But Improves Course Focus",27 January 2005,"Less Class Time Does Not Allow for as Much In-Class Listening, But Improves Course FocusBy Lucie Kroening Columbia Daily SpectatorA Music Hum scheduling change last year affords students less class time for listening to Kosquin Desprez's motets—and more free time for listening to Snoop Dogg's rhymes. In the spring of 2004, the University announced that the time allotted for Masterpieces of Western Music, commonly called Music Hum, would be reduced from one hour and 50 minutes to the one hour and 15 minute period that is standard for three-point classes. The course maintained its threepoint credit value. Originally labeled ""a one-year experiment,"" the shorter format has now entered its second year. Walter Frisch, chair of Music Humanities, said the change was intended to realign the number of hours spent in class with the course's point value. The adjustment also brought Music Hum ""more into line with other Core classes,"" he said, by covering fewer works in greater detail. Reaction among students and instructors has been mixed. According to Frisch, the change was not an effort to trim the Music Department's budget. ""The College is always very accommodating and generous when it comes to staffing [and funding] the Core,"" Frisch wrote in an e-mail. When Music Hum was first added to the core in 1947, most students did not have a way to listen to pieces discussed in class. The extra hour was intended to be a listening hour. But with the advent of new technology, Frisch said that the listening hour had become ""very illdefined."" The reduction in class time also shortened the syllabus of musical works and forced instructors to be more efficient in class. Students are now expected to do more listening outside of class via the Internet, as all of the music covered in the class can be found in an online reserve. ""Online listening is not and has never been a substitute for in-class listening,"" Frisch said, pointing out that the online work is meant to be supplementary. For some lessexperienced students, listening in the dorm room may help them feel ""less pressure,"" he said, and enable them to listen to the pieces as many times as they need to. But Alicia Harper, CC 'O6, who took Music Hum in the fall of 2004, disagreed. ""I got more out of [the music] listening in class,"" Harper said. She said it was easier to hear the different elements of the music when the teacher was present to point them out. When Harper originally signed up for Music Hum last spring, and noticed the shorter class length, she was nervous. ""I thought it wasa mistake,"" she said. But when she found out the time change was deliberate, she felt cheated by the shorter class. Even though some material had been removed, the class was rushed, she said. Elizabeth Carey, CC 'O6, who took Music Hum in the spring of 2003—before the change was made—was annoyed that other students will receive the same amount of credit she did for taking a shorter class than the one she took. Others, like Jessica Weston, CC 'O6, who also took the longer class, said, ""1 don't think one point is that big of a deal."" There are currently no plans to retroactively compensate students who took the longer Music Hum class in the past. According to a census taken by the department, a majority of the faculty preferred the new format. Morgan Luker, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who has been teaching Music Hum for five years, admitted that the change was ""jarring"" at first; it is ""easier to explain [the music] while listening,"" he said. But judging from the performance on exams, he said, students seem to be learning the material just as well. In previous years, students may have ""felt like they were drowning"" in the massive amount of music covered. The new format is ""more focused,"" Luker said. The department has also made a change to its instructor-training program. Previously, graduate students would learn by teaching in a number of Music Hum sections. Luker, who went through the old process, described his experience as being ""thrown to the lions."" Luker often worked 30 hours a week with several professors at once, each of whom taught the class differently. Under the new system, graduate students are assigned to a single professor or an experienced graduate student for the semester. While the trainees do not take part in grading, they do teach some classes and help formulate the syllabus. According to Frisch, who sat in on some classes to observe the new teaching assistants, the change seems to work very well. After all the changes have been assessed, some faculty-members think the greatest loss is the cutting of musical works from the syllabus. Ignoring works such as Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, assistant professor Karen Henson said, is ""painful."" ""The world will carry on without it,"" she said. Henson, a new instructor who has only taught the shorter format, prefers it to the idea of a two-hour class period. Music Hum ""shouldn't be the most oppressive class. It should be enjoyable,"" she said."
353,Music Humanities,"GSEU Strikers Return To the Classroom Opinion Split on Effects of One-Week Strike, Administration Still Not Willing to Negotiate",25 April 2005,"Opinion Split on Effects of One-Week Strike, Administration Still Not Willing to NegotiateBy John Davisson Spectator Staff WriterAcross the University, graduate preceptors, instructors, teaching assistants, and research assistants will return to their classes today, one week after Graduate Student Employees United began its second strike in as many years. While many will return fresh from the picket lines, armed with firsthand accounts of the labor trenches, others will continue teaching uninterrupted, unfazed, and unmoved by the efforts of their peers. The question of how many of each, exactly, is an open one. ""My sense is that it had broad support,"" said Maurice Leutenegger, a GSEU organizer and RA in the physics department. ""It would be hard to imagine that it wouldn't have some impact."" Though the effectiveness of the strike remains uncertain, GSEU's presence was quite visible during the week. Members conducted daily picket lines outside the 116 th Street gates, participated in rallies near campus and downtown, and testified at a hearing of the New York City Council Committees on Laborand Higher Education. The strike was also coordinated with that of Graduate Employees and Students Organization, Yale's counterpart to GSEU. ""Whether they like to admit it or not, we had a major impact on the University during the week of the strike,"" said David Wolach, a GSEU organizer. ""The University administration has been thoroughly embarrassed."" Lytton Smith, a second year student in the Graduate School of the Arts and University Writing instructor, expressed doubt about GSEU's methods, including the recent strike. ""I can understand why they're doing what they're doing, but I just now feel like we're caught in a deadlock position where the University's not going to budge,"" Smith said. Provost Alan Brinkley downplayed the effect of the strike on the University's operation. ""It's not trivial, but it wasn't enormous either,"" Brinkley said. ""Like last year, it was concentrated mostly in the Core, and it did have a significant impact, especially onUniversity Writing, also on CC and Lit Hum. We don't have specific numbers, but a very large proportion of those sections did not meet."" Last Thursday, through interviews and independent e-mail polling, Spectator attempted to gauge the strike participation of the 168 precepts and instructors who currently lead sections of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and University Writing, the five courses believed most widely affected by the strike. Of the 93 respondents, 65 percent reported having cancelled all of their classes, 2 percent reported having cancelled only some of their classes, and 33 percent reported that they held all of their sections. Of those who held class, 20 percent reported having conducted at least one class off-campus. Eighty percent of those cancelling classes said that they had or intended to participate in GSEUorganized strike events. Polling did not include precepts, TAs, or RAs serving in other departments and does not necessarily reflect participation across the broader graduate population. The data suggests that a large majority of TAs from the five sampled Core classes chose to respect the strike action, but the numbers fall short of the 80-plus percent support that GSEU reported from its strike vote. Professor Joseph Bizup, director of the Undergraduate Writing Program, said that though a ""great many"" sections of University Writing did not meet, professors were not asked to stand-in forstriking instructors. ""Pedagogically, it doesn't make sense to cover a class with someone for one week when the students have been working on their writing with another instructor all semester,"" Bizup said. Professor Deborah Martinsen, acting director of the Core Curriculum, estimated that ""slightly over half' of Lit Hum precepts and three-quarters of CC precepts were not in their classrooms during the week. ""Some of them are out on strike, some of them are just not in their classroom,"" Martinsen said, referring to a small segment of graduate teachers who moved classes to off-campus locations. Like University Writing, the classes were not otherwise covered. GSEU organizers were hopeful about the long-term outcome of the unionization movement. ""The only criteria that we have to know if we succeed at some point is if they agree to negotiate with us, but that doesn't mean we failed if they didn't immediately agree to do so,"" Leutenegger said. Brinkley expressed openness to a dialogue on the concerns of graduates. ""[President Bollinger] said last year that he believed that we should have a discussion within the community about this and that it shouldn't just be his decision as to what we do,"" he explained. ""It's something that we would be open to discussing in the community, but it would be a discussion that would certainly have to include the faculty."" To date, the University has maintained that graduate teachers are fundamentally students and not employees.GSEU STRIKE POLL Are you cancelling your classes this week as part of the strike?

354,Music Humanities,GRADUATE STUDENT UNIONIZATION GSEU Holds Strike For Second Year One Week Walkout Coincided With Similar Yale Strike,9 May 2005,"GSEU Holds Strike For Second YearOne Week Walkout Coincided With Similar Yale StrikeBy John Davisson Spectator Staff WriterFor the second time in as many years, graduate student preceptors, instructors, teaching assistants, and research assistants took to the picket lines this spring in an ongoing movement to earn collective bargaining rights with the University. While their efforts fell against a new legal backdrop, the fundamental arguments and the familiar standoff were the same. Nearly five years after the formation of Graduate Student Employees United, the organization leading the pro-union charge, parties remained deadlocked on the employment status of graduate student teachers. While GSEU asserts that their service to the University qualifies them as full-fledged employees, Columbia's administration maintains that they are fundamentally students and are therefore not entided to a union. GSEU put a referendum to its membership in the early spring, just as it had done in 2004. On the evening of April 13, organizers announced that ""over 80 percent"" of members had elected to carry out a second large-scale strike, scheduled to last from April 18 to April 22. ""Based on the overwhelming support for this plan, that GSEU voted to strike collectively, we are going ahead with the strike,"" said David Wolach, a GSEU organizer and graduate student in the history department who declined to release an exact vote tally. GSEU members cite a wide range of reasons to pursue unionization, including inadequate stipends, poor health coverage, and their importance to the day-to-day functioning of the University. 'When we withhold our labor, that highlights'the value of our service, and thafs something the University needs to recognize,"" said Erik Goldner, also a GSEU organizer and graduate student in the history department Administration officials counter that most TAs and preceptors receive the best financial aid packages of any Columbia students, and that their teaching roles are a necessary part of their education, not a stand-alone means of employment During the strike, many classrooms were emptied of their instructors as the 116 th gates flooded with graduate students and union sympathizers. They arrived each morning with pick-"" 1 at signs, slogans, noisemakers, and, on occasion, a giant inflatable rat prepared to give a voice and a face to the union movement The strike ""moves you closer to recognition,"" said Maurice Leutenegger, a GSEU member and physics research assistant 'We don't know what the administration tipping point is. No one ever knows when their employer will cave and recognize them, but we do know there is such a point From a practical standpoint there's a palpable sense of gaining momentum."" The strike effort included several high-profilerallies, attended variously by AFL-CIO president John Sweeney, Unite Here! President John Wilhelm, Rev. Jesse Jackson, city officials, and hundreds of members of both the AFL-CIO and the graduate students' would-be umbrella union, the United Auto Workers. GSEU also coordinated its strike with that of Graduate Employees and Students Organization, Yale's equivalent graduate student body. Several busloads of GESO members traveled to Morningside Heights on April 18 to attend a joint labor rally. As similar as it appeared to the 2004 strike, this year's dispute was conducted under new legal and tactical developments. In July 2004, the National Labor Relations Board, which holds federal authority over unionization matters, ruled 3-2 against Brown University's similarly proposed graduate student union. ""There is a significant risk, and indeed a strong likelihood, that the collective-bargaining process will be detrimental to the educational process,"" the ruling read. ""We declare federal law to be that graduate assistants are not employees."" The decision reversed a 2000 NLRB decision that had upheld the collective bargaining rights of New York University's graduate instructors, who are unionized. During last year's GSEU strike, many graduate students cited the NYU precedent as a validation of their cause. In 2002, the NLRB conducted a unionization vote among Columbia's graduate student teachers. But Columbia filed an appeal soon after that vote, and the NLRB impounded the ballots pending its decision. Based on the most r|cent NLRB decision, the University won its apjSeal last August and the ballots were destroyed""without being tallied. As a result of the ruling, GSEU did not enjoy the legal protection or mediation of the NLRB this year. The graduate students' efforts tried to get the University to do something that the law no longer requires and that the administration has consistently said it will not do: granting them collective bargaining rights. Also different this year was the format of the strike. In 2004, the GSEU vote called for an openended walkout, which was brought to an end after one month through the mediation of state and city officials. This year's effort, though also calling for professors to hold classes off campus and all graduate students to boycott classes, was Strictly limited to a single week. GSEU organisers argued that concentrating their efforts into a shorter period would achieve a more visible effect. That graduate student teachers are distributed across so many departments and teaching roles makes it difficult to judge the full impact of the strike. A Spectator poll projected that about 65 percent of graduate student instructors and preceptors in Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, University Writing, and Art andMusic Humanities chose to strike. Many have suggested that these Core classes, most of which are led by humanities, social sciences, and arts graduate students, were most affected by the strike. Sixty-one percent of Core Classes were cancelled on account of the strike, a number that falls short of the 80 percent support that GSEU reported from its strike vote. The figure does not necessarily reflect the broader impact of the walkout. Whatever the exact totals, there were many graduate student teachers who disagreed with the strike action. Some supported GSEU but opposed this particular tactic, others expressed disgust with GSEU's reportedly aggressive sup-port-building tactics, while still others fundamentally opposed unionization. ""I can understand why they're doing what they're doing, but I just now feel like we're caught in a deadlock position where the University's not goihg to budge,"" said Lytton Smith, a secondyear graduate student in the School for the Arts and University Writing instructor. Smith said that he objected specifically to GSEU's involvement with UAW, which he claimed would unnecessarily entangle graduate students in broader union battles. Even after the strike ended, the controversial issue of graduate student unionization flared again. On April 25, the liberal magazine The Nation published an internal Columbia admin-istration memo on its Web site that discusses possible measures to take against TAs and instructors who chose to strike. ""We should seek to reduce the possibility of future strikes in our response to those teaching fellows who fail to meet their instructional commitments,"" the letter read. Signed in February by Provost Alan Brinkley and addressed to 17 senior administrators, the letter also considers requiring extra instructional commitments and withdrawing award eligibility from striking graduate students. There is no evidence that any of the included proposals were enacted, but the language is a sharp departure from past public statements. Brinkley has previously emphasized that graduate students should not face retribution for their decision to strike. ""I don't think it's dangerous f<ir people to discuss options,"" Briiikley said in defense of the memo as a private weighSfi£""6f ofitianS. ""Whaffe important is what we do, not the proposals people might make."" Several GSEU members brought up the memo at a contentious April 26 meeting of the Graduate Student Advisory Council, the Univer-sity-recognized graduate student government, taking the opportunity to lash out at GSAC's stance of neutrality on the strike. A letter condemning the memo was also recently delivered to Brinkley on behalf of 46 graduate studentsfrom his own history department ""Whether or not we favor graduate unionization,"" it read, ""we all agree that intimidation and retribution have no place in a university that values academic freedom."" Since the strike, the administration has not signaled any policy changes nor has GSEU publicly backed down. Thus, the future of the unionization movement remains, as it always has, uncertain. Brinkley, while reiterating the University's present stance against the unionization of graduate students, said he was open to a dialogue on the subject President Bollinger ""said last year that he believed 1 that we should have a discussion within the community about this and that it shouldn't just be his decision as to what we do. Fc>r a range of reasons, mostly because we had other things going on this year, we didn't dd that this year, although we had hoped to,"" Brinkley said. GSEU organizers said that they will consider future actions over the summer and continue to speak optimistically about their efforts.

355,Music Humanities,"Lecture Showdowns, Uptown Expansion, Picket Lines—Just Another Year at CU",30 August 2005,"The last few years have seen a number of headline issues strike Morningside Heights - some of them even made national news, only to peter out somewhere in the administrative jungle inside Low Library. Here's a rundown on some of the biggest that are likely to remain important this year. The MEALAC Controversy The word MEALAC rumbled through campus last year, becoming short-hand for a weighty, complex, and still-unresolved controversy that shook Columbia and gained national attention. The debate focused on accusations of anti-Israel intimidation by professors, leaving the department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures (MEALAC) in turmoil, but also present were numerous threads of long-standing political, religious, and academic battles. At the center of the storm was a video recorded in winter 2003 by a number of Jewish undergraduate students documenting allegations of anti-Israel verbal abuse by professors. The film was initially shown in fall 2004 to a few members of the administration in closed screenings. When word began reaching alumni and other groups, students began screening the film, called ""Columbia Unbecoming,"" to small audiences on campus. The peak of the controversy came in November 2004, with CNN producing a clip and the New York Daily News running front page articles with headlines like ""Hatred 101"" and referring to Columbia as a ""Poison Ivy."" In campus discussion, student (and outside) concerns moved beyond the specific incidents mentioned in the film to encompass what was characterized a general anti-Israel slant to the MEALAC department, and Middle East studies in general at Columbia At the end of the fall semester, Columbia President Lee Bollinger appointed an ad hoc faculty committee to investigate the complaints. The resulting report released in April, avoided any consideration of the Middle East studies curriculum, instead limiting itself to a detailed evaluation of the University's grievance channels. The committee issued a harsh condemnation of Columbia's procedures for dealing with academic grievances and advising channels, saying that students' complaints about Middle East studies professors were ignored or mishandled for years by being shuffled between various administrators. Like the committee, the major figures in Columbia's administration walked a delicate line between the students' complaints and the professors accused of misconduct In a series of public statements, University President Lee Bollinger offered a nuanced defense of academic freedom but said that professorial autonomy has limits. The ad hoc committee said it found no evidence of anti-Sem-itism, and addressed only three of the most highly publicized allegations of intimidation - two involving assistant professor Joseph Massad and one involving professor George Saliba. Of the three incidents, the committee found one to be ""credible:"" an incident in spring 2002 when Massad allegedly shouted at a student to get out of his class because she was defending Israeli military conduct The committee said Massad violated standard norms of acceptable professorial conduct Two other students interviewed by the committee corroborated the account but Massad has staunchly denied it Soon after the report was released, 20 of Massad's former students who say they were enrolled in the class signed a petition denying the exchange ever occurred. Meanwhile, the University slowly revamped its grievance channels, resulting in an flurry of new policies that were announced at the end of the spring semester. The changes include internal revisions to individual schools' policies, as well as several new University- wide measures. At the center of the new policies was the formation of a permanent five member faculty committee in Arts and Sciences. The committee will hear student grievances that could not be reconciled through more informal channels, like student advising, or students can bring grievances directly to the committee. This is a sharp departure from previous decisions to allow each indidivual school within the University to determine all disciplinary measures. The vice president for Arts and Sciences, Nicholas Dirks, will decide whether to adopt the committee's recommendations, and students can appeal the decision to the provost Alan Brinkley, who has the final say. At the same time, Bollinger announced the establishment of a new President's Council on Student Affairs, a small panel of student representatives from across the University that will meet regularly with top administrators to discuss student issues, but by the end of the semester there had been no more details announced. Manhattanville Columbia is growing uptown. Over the next 30 years, the University plans to expand into an area of West Harlem known as Manhattanville. The multibillion dollar plan calls for a new campus stretching from 125 th to 133 rd Streets between Broadway and the Hudson River, containing science and research labs, a new School of the Arts, and residential and academic buildings. The expansion is designed to alleviate the space crunch that has existed at Columbia for years. Columbia has the lowest space-to-student ratio in the Ivy League. Right now, Manhattanville looks nothing like a college campus in the making. It is one of the last remaining manufacturing areas in New York City, populated by auto repair shops, warehouses, and moving and storage companies, as well as some residential buildings. Columbia says its plans will help the neighborhood. It esti-mates that the Manhattanville project will create 14,000 jobs. But many residents are skeptical. They doubt that the new jobs will go to local residents. Led by a group called the Coalition to Preserve Community, they worry that Columbia's presence will cause rents to rise and ultimately force them out of their homes. They fear that new labs will conduct biotech research and pose a public health hazard. Community Board 9, the most local governmental entity, has come up with its own blueprint for development in the area, known as a 197-a plan. The 197-a differs in a few significant ways with Columbia's plan. Columbia currently owns 42% of the land in the proposed expansion area. The University wants to own all the land before going forward with its plans. But some of the property owners say they won't sell. Columbia has asked the state to consider using eminent domain, the power by which the government can forcibly buy private property for public use, to take the land and turn it over to the University. Despite a recent Supreme Court ruling saying eminent domain can be used to promote economic development the property owners vow to fiercely resist this tactic. The University says it is a last resort Before Columbia can start building in Manhattanville, it needs to get the area's zoning designation changed from manufacturing to mixed use to allow construction of academic halls, labs, and dorms. This fall the University will enter into the Uniform Land Use Review Process (ULURP), to garner approval for its rezoning plans from several levels of government Columbia will also have to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), outlining the likely environmental fallout from the proposed changes. The ULURP process, which typically takes between six months and a year, must be successfully completed before Columbia can start turning its elaborate plans for Manhattanville into reality. Graduate Student Unionization Union, NOW! Union, now? Despite years of protests and strikes, Columbia's gradu-ate student unionization movement has made little progress. But there's little indication that Graduate Student Employees United (GSEU), the organization leading the pro-union charge, is going to give up any time soon, despite Columbia's refusal to budge on the issue. GSEU's major contention is that the service that graduate student preceptors, teaching assistants, and research assistants perform qualifies them as full-fledged employees of the University. Columbia's administration maintains that they are primarily students and are therefore not entitled to form a union. The same debate In 2002, the National Labor Relations Board, which holds federal authority over unionization matters, polled graduate student teachers to see if they wanted to unionize. But Columbia filed an appeal soon after that vote, and the NLRB impounded the ballots pending a decision. GSEU held internal membership votes in the springs of both 2004 and 2005 on walkout strikes. Both passed. The first year, an open-ended walkout lasted for about a month, and ended right before graduation through the mediation of state and city officials. In August 2004, the University won its appeal before the NLRB and the ballots from 2002 were destroyed without being tallied. The decision came on the back of a ruling earlier that summer on a similar case at Brown University. That vote fell 3-2 against Brown University's similarly proposed graduate student union, reversing a 2000 decision that upheld the collective bargaining rights of New York University's graduate instructors. The 2004 ruling was widely perceived to weaken GSEU's case, and in April 2005 the organization voted for a one-week strike. GSEU organizers argued that concentrating their efforts into a shorter period would achieve a more visible effect During the strike, many classrooms were emptied of their instructors as the 116 th ST. gates flooded with graduate students and union sympathizers. They arrived each morning with picket signs, slogans, noisemakers, and, on occasion, a giant inflatable rat, prepared to give a voice and a face to the union movement The strike effort included several high-profile rallies, attended variously by high profile figures including AFLCIO presidentjohn Sweeney, Unite Here! President John Wilhelm, Rev. Jesse Jackson, city officials, and hundreds of members of both the AFLCIO and the graduate students' would-be umbrella union, the United Auto Workers. GSEU also coordinated its strike with a similar strike at Yale. The distribution of graduate student preceptors across many departments and teaching roles made it difficult to judge the full impact of the strike, but it was widely believed that Core classes were the most heavily affected and humanities classes suffered more than sciences and engineering. The first year, numerous sections of Contemporary Civilizations were with-out instructors, and were administered a uniform final. Last spring, a Spectator survey estimated that around 65 percent of graduate student instructors and preceptors in Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, University Writing, and Art and Music Humanities chose to strike. Whatever the exact totals, many graduate student teachers disagreed with the strike action. Some supported GSEU but opposed this particular tactic, others expressed disgust with GSEU's reportedly aggressive support- building tactics, while still others fundamentally opposed unionization. While GSEU called both strikes successful in raising awareness, the future of the movement at Columbia is unclear. Diversity At a school that prides itself as being one of the most diverse in the Ivy League, the issue of diversity, both among the student body and among professors, continues to inspire controversy, protest, and —most recently—money. This summer, Columbia announced that $l5 million of internal funds would be devoted to diversity hiring initiatives. This is one of a number of steps the University has taken in the past year after a number of efforts in spring 2004 by students and faculty to make the administration deal with Columbia's infrastructure—or lack thereof—to support diversity. In spring 2004, a large number of students held a week-long series of sit-ins on the steps to Low Library to protest controversial events including a cartoon in the humor magazine The Fed and flyers put up by the Columbia University Marching Band that were seen as racially offensive. Hie protesting students said the incidents were indicative of a campus indifference to racism. They called for student input on policies regarding bias-related incidents, revisions of the Core curriculum, and the creation of a central administration position dealing with multicultural affairs. At the same time, some professors were raising concerns over both racial and gender diversity among the faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University division that houses Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Last year, the administration responded to these various concerns in a variety of ways. One of the most visible was the appointment last fall of Jean Howard, a professor of English, to the new three-year position of Vice Provost of Diversity Initiatives. Since then, Howard has focused on increasing the number of women and minorities hired to new faculty positions. Women and racial minorities are chronically under-rep-resented in the faculty of the Arts and Sciences. Although 30 percent of undergraduates belong to minority groups, only 16 percent of faculty members are minorities, according to the Columbia University Statistical Abstract from Fall 2003. According to the University Senate's 2002 ""Pipeline"" report on the advancement of women through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, women made up only one-third of tenure-eligible faculty and less than 20 percent of tenured faculty at that time. Howard is careful to note that the committee was not concerned just with the physical makeup of the faculty body. Inclusive hiring, Howard said, requires that searches be defined broadly, that the composition of search committees themselves be diverse, and that a conscious effort be made to outreach to networks that include diverse candidates. This includes targeting the recipients of prestigious fellowships that support women and minorities in junior faculty appointments. Last fall also marked the opening of the Office of Multicultural Affairs, led by Dean Corlisse Thomas, which is intended to serve as a resource for student concerns regarding issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation on campus. In addition to providing general support and advocacy, the OMA advises the approximately 40 cultural organizations which formerly fell under the jurisdiction of Student Development and Activities. The office was also involved in RA and NSOP training this summer.A student marches with a sign by the Broadway gates to demand that graduate TAs be allowed to form a union (left).

357,Music Humanities,Contributor Estuary Generation,25 October 2005,"Estuary GenerationBy Victoria BaranetskyI boarded the plane to Paris, on the last day of junior year in college with three unregulated carry-ons, two limp legs, and one thesis-exhausted cerebrum all weighing down my gait My gods were not to soak in French culture or even to finally see the Mona Lisa I wanted detox. As I sipped on India Air ginger ale, I decided to feel vindicated for my self-funded trip. But once I crossed the Atlantic, that ginger calm quickly disintegrated. As I gawked at the size of the Louvre, I compared it to the importance of doing well at my summer internship. As I admired the tear-jerking vista from Montmarte, I mourned about my upcoming LSAT class. In Luxembourg gardens, as my friends and I enjoyed goat cheese with pinot I hoped the spirits would dull my thoughts on my upcoming Music Humanities summer class. It seemed that the 10-day hiatus had turned into a lOday meta misery. Lowered back into the steel landscape at 9 am. into LaGuardia Airport, I stepped off the plane, anxious to be back. Nine hours later, I heaved myself off the 42nd subway stop into LSAT class. My under 2&-year-old instructor, who had scored a perfect 180 on the LSAT, revealed that his own success taking this course was specifically due to: ""Homework. It is very important I really want to stress this. If you do all the homework, you will do well in the course. And if you do well in the course, you will score high on the LSAT And if you score high on the LSAT, you will get into a top-10 law school. And if you get into a top-10 law school, you will get a good job. And if you get a good job, you will marry well. And if you marry well you will have great children..."" I, along with my class, exhaled an awkward laugh. Homework was the answer. But for the next three months I began to break my resolution. Once out of bed, I was out the door in 10 minutes to start my day: subway, Legal Services internship, subway, Music Hum, subway, Legal Service internship, subway, and then LSAT class. Finally free at 10 p.m. I flowed into the street convergingwith the flood of people exiting Bryant Park. Rather than rush for the subway, I walked home. Once home, I couldn't distinguish between recitative or aria, and I certainly had no energy left for homework. But the problem was larger than me not picking up a number two pencil to figure out what answer can logically be inferred from the passage. The real issue was that I am part of the Estuary Generation. I am part of a generation that has all of the possibilities, and I want them all. Raised on the motto: more is better, pertains not only to quantity, but also quality. With this attitude consuming the less important aspects of our lives, it has been impossible not to incorporate this maxim into our larger goals. Like my LSAT teacher knew; we want everything. We want to go to an Ivy School, not community college; score perfect on the LSAT, not ""do OK;"" find our calling, not our profession; and marry our soul mate, not someone that we just love. 1 am to blame, but I cannot take full responsibility. Our generation is a product of technology, our parents, and the current state of affairs. We are always looking forward to a newer better gadget Our parents' divorce epidemic has put my generation in fear of committing too quickly. We are holding out for our soul mate. Our parents' decision to sell out for a miserable but well-paying job makes us want a calling. With the current state of affairs, we are somewhat disgruntled, but more apathetic, because we have never had to deal with a world war or a Vietnam. Hence we focus more on attaining the glamour of Paris Hilton, the power of the Republican Party, and the knowledge of Jon Stewart My generation has been deposited into the sea of endless possibility. And when we finally gain direction and reach a goal, there is always farther to go. Our gluttony will never be satiated. What is our estuary generation supposed to do? Can we just flow back into Paris, and give it another go?The author is a Columbia College senior majoring in history."
358,Music Humanities,"URBANITIES THEPROFILE With 22 Glowing Reviews, Jazz Guru Chris Washburne Is One of CU's Most Loved Professors CULPA's Unattainable 'Golden Nugget'",15 November 2005,"With 22 Glowing Reviews, Jazz Guru Chris Washburne Is One of CU's Most Loved ProfessorsCULPA's Unattainable 'Golden Nugget'By Julia IsraelThis week, students across campus will flock to computer labs to sign onto SSOL and register for courses. Although the wrath of midterms seems to have only recently ceased, the time has once again arrived to open up those familiar windows on our computers—the College, SEAS and Barnard course bulletins and Columbia's Underground Listing of Professor Ability, commonly known as CULPA —to decipher how to take classes that won't leave us embittered towards our work, our instructors and our peers. In honor of course registration, we at Urbanities decided to delve a little deeper into professor ability than CULPA does. We browsed CULPA's ""golden nuggets"" for a professor with wide appeal and a heaping stack of beaming reviews. We then sought to answer the question: What makes a professor so good? Jazz professor Chris Washburne, the proprietor of 22 reviews, seemed like the right person to ask. Although Washburne expressed disappointment in CULPA for its ""lack of critical thinking,"" his commentary on his own teaching background, methods and goals seemed to correlate with the raves that call him ""inspiring,"" ""passionate,"" and ""interested in his students.""As a fifth-generation professor, Washburne says he was instilled with the ""importance of teaching in society ... and the ability to facilitate the learning and the shaping of others"" as a child. Although Washburne is the sole music professor in his family, he cites his parents' and grandparents' backgrounds in sociology and psychology as having sparked his interest in cultural studies. An ethnomusicologist, Washburne not only studies music, but also researches the cultures that surround and create music. Of course, many professors harbor backgrounds in academia similar to Washburne's. What differentiates this long-haired music junkie from the pack of professors with sub-par CULPA reviews is his unique philosophy towards his students and his background in entertaining a crowd. Before Washburne became a professor, he earned a living as a full-time professional musician. Today Washburne draws upon his performance methods to keep his students engaged with the material during class. With subjects like Jazz and Music of the Caribbean at the forefront of his lectures, Washburne says that the material ""doesn't need that much help,"" but maintains that professors can make any topic ""extremely boring"" through theirdelivery. Washburne employs humor when he can, but always focuses on presenting his lecture in what he refers to as a ""dramatic"" style. Giving a lecture is like ""telling a story,"" Washburne said. ""There should be a beginning, a middle and an end, and there should always be a message at thatend."" But attending a Washburne seminar or lecture involves a great deal more than listening to a simple tale. Washburne claims to have no patience for students who feel like they ""have to be here"" or for students who put grades at the top of the ""hierarchy of importance."" He onlyrewards students who, he says, ""take readings and transcend the boundaries of class time by interacting with them on their own and then who come back and share what they've learned with me."" To inspire this behavior, Washburne says he strives ""to treat the students like I wanted to be treated by my professors."" In Music Humanities, Washburne spends the first few weeks of class teaching students the elements of music by listening to contemporary songs the students have picked out themselves. When he saw his students' eyes glaze over as he began to play the Kyrie, Washburne knew he had to be creative if he wanted the students to understand the material. ""How do you make sense of a Gregorian Chant?"" he said. For Washburne, the answer lay in playing a version of the chant by the contemporary funk music project Enigma. Washburne has been applauded by students on CULPA for what many call an ""easy"" grading policy, but the ethnomusicologist says his focus simply isn't on grades. Instead he emphasizes education. If a student doesn't do well on a midterm, but proves that he or she has gained an understanding of the material on the final, Washburne says he won't allow the midterm to pull the grade down.""I grade based on improvement,"" Washburne said. In his Introduction to Jazz class, Washburne attempts to impart knowledge of music and to create a new generation of audiences for jazz performance. He says he wants his students to learn to appreciate music in the same way he does. Mostly, however, Washburne said, ""I want to teach the students how to listen and how to really hear and that's something that important across all disciplines."" In the spirit of the frustration that tends to accompany course registration, Washburne will be on sabbatical next semester. He insists, however, that while one ""golden nugget"" may not be on the roster this spring, Columbia employs ""so many important figures"" that he cannot recommend one professor over another. For Washburne, the best college experiences happened in his Philosophy classes, the courses he took ""just for fun."" He suggests that students follow his lead in exploring courses' outside of their majors. Perhaps it is this appreciation for ""fun,"" a word many a student has used to describe Washburne's jazz class on CULPA, that makes this professor the Columbia student's ideal. And perhaps it's his absence in the College Bulletin that makes course registration so grueling.Professor Chris Washburne Is known throughout the student body for his focus on engaging students in classes such as Introduction to Jazz."
359,Music Humanities,Registration Policy to Change New System Will Allow Student Athletes to Register Before Their Peers,12 April 2006,"New System Will Allow Student Athletes to Register Before Their PeersBy Amanda Erickson Spectator Senior Staff WriterNon-senior athletes will be able to register for classes before other students in their year during registration next week, under a new pilot program approved by the University. The program, which was changed significantly on Monday, after members of the administration met with several student council members from the Columbia College Student Council, the General Studies Student Council, and the Engineering Student Council, will allow juniors and sophomores who play on varsity sports teams at Columbia the opportunity to pick classes earlier than the rest of their class. All seniors will pick classes at the same time, regardless of whether or not they play sports. Smaller courses will be capped in order to ensure that there is space in core classes like Art and Music Humanities and in popular seminars for non-ath-letes. Students in all four undergraduate schools received an e-mail informing them of the pilot program late Tuesday night Administrators hope the new policy will make it easier for athletes to put together a schedule that doesn't conflict with practice time. According tosurveys done by the Athletic department, difficulty putting together a schedule is the number one reason students quit their sports teams, ""Athletes have less control over the timing of their activities [than other students],"" University Provost Alan Brinkley said. ""As an institution, we ask a lot of our athletes. We ask them to represent the University ... This is a small step to make it easier for athletes to be students."" But some student leaders said the regulations give an unfair advantage to some students while excluding others who have just as much difficulty putting together a schedule. ""It's really unfair,"" said Ellen Marrone, CC 'OB. ""It doesn't take into consideration people on financial aid, people who need a job."" Others on club sports wish that they too had the option of choosing classes early. ""It's unfair,"" said outgoing squash team captain Bobby Ghosh, CC 'O6. On squash, ""a big problem is that we struggle to find a common time to practice."" But administrators said that while every student at the University faces difficulty balancing jobs and extra-curricular activities with class schedules, student athletes are brought to Columbia to represent Columbia and therefore tire University has a specialobligation to make sure they are able to balance their academic and athletic lives. ""Clearly, there are costs to doing this,"" Brinkley said. But it must be ""weighed against the tremendous disadvantage the athletes face if we do nothing."" Other students said changes to the system may benefit everyone. It's the ""first step in evaluation and improvement that will be made to the registration system,"" said CCSC student services representative Alex Green, CC 'O6. And student athletes said die change will make a world of difference for them. For lacrosse player Holly Glynn, CC 'O9, the chance to register early will help her pick her schedule. 'We need it because our schedules are so demanding,"" she said. The last two semesters, '1 had trouble registering ... because the classes I needed were full."" Athletic Director M. Dianne Murphy did not return calls asking for comment According to Lisa Hogarty, executive vice president of student and administrative services, the initial program will be evaluated at the end of the semester to see if changes need to be made for the fall. The administration said the program is part of a larger effort to improve the quality of life for athletes, a push that has been going on since Murphy stepped up as athletics director, and former football coach Bill Campbell, CC '62, was elected chair of the Trustees of the University.One goal is to better spread class times throughout the day. According to one University study, all political theory classes, five out of six comparative politics seminars, and almost 75 percent of history seminars were only offered after 2 p.m. during the 2005-2006 academic year. Brinkley said he and others are working with the large departments like economics, political science, history, and English to better distribute class times. Both he and Hogarty said departments had seemed willing to look into making changes and were hoping to see some concrete results by next year. Student leaders also expressed frustration that they were told about the new plan only days before it was to be instated. CCSC President Michelle Oh, CC 'O6, said the council should have been consulted earlier. No Barnard students were present at the meeting, and SGA President M. A. Moutoussis said she was unaware that there was any change in the policy. But Oh said that their feedback was taken seriously and resulted in a shift from the initial policy, which would have allowed all athletes to register before all students, to the current one. ""The primary concern from members of council was this: we understand that athletes have a serious time strain and scheduling strain,"" she said. ""But should that frump seniority? Council members felt that [die agreed-upon policy] was a reasonable compromise."" Oh said student council reaction was mixed, spanning from enthusiastic support to more critical opipjns.""As an institution, we ask a lot of our athletes. We ask them to represent the University ... This is a small step to make it easier for athletes to be students."" —Man Brinkley, University Provost"
360,Music Humanities,Columbia Professors Receive Varied Perks Bonuses Range From Housing to Funding,18 October 2006,"Bonuses Range From Housing to FundingBY ALINE REYNOLDS Columbia Daily SpectatorThe perks of being a Columbia professor don't end with prestige and the fifthhighest average salary among Ivy League schools. Some have summer research projects, tuition exemption for their children, and seed funding for research and travel, while a select few can even get access to $lO,OOO music recording studios for compositional projects. Most full-time professors are given between $l,OOO and $2,000 annually to spend on research-related endeavors, such as equipment and traveling fees. ""Research grants given by all universities are meant to provide seed funding to germinate, not complete, research projects,"" said Irving R Herman, professor and chair of the applied physics and mathematics department Herman, like most professors, acquires most of his research grants from outside institutions, such as the National Science Foundation. Some of these centers require matching funds from the University which are negotiated by the faculty member. ""This form of funding is a reasonable and fair system,"" said Herman. According to Susan Boynton, an assistant professor of music, the annual research allotment for the music department has increased from $1,750 to $2,000, although she says that the value should still be higher. ""I have been pleased with the recent increase in grant funding. However, I don't think it's a sufficient amount for extensive travel and research,"" Boynton said. Boynton, like Herman, has relied on external research grants that have recently enabled her to go on a research trip to Spain. She also says that she has greatly benefited from an additional summer fellowship of $1,500, for which music professors are eligible after five years of teaching a Core class, such as music humanities. The tuition exemption for professors' children is another benefit. Columbia professors are reimbursed for half of tuition fees for children who attend other universities and full tuition for kids who attend Columbia. This offer is granted to the whole range of faculty, from tenured professors to lecturers.Anna P. Delia Valle, a lecturer in economics, has saved approximately $40,000 in tuition fees, $lO,OOO of which resulted from the bonus's tax-free status. ""It is a wonderful perk because it is treated as a scholarship and therefore is not taxable,"" Delia Valle said. ""With two of my kids currently enrolled in college, it's doubly wonderful."" Professors can also benefit from the housing facilities provided by the University and assigned by the Housing Priorities Committee, allowing proximity to campus and affordable living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. As a form of stipend, all types of faculty and administrators are entitled to rent Columbia-owned apartments at discounted rates.Boynton says she has profited from this perk for three years and is pleased with her living conditions. ""It's a very nice benefit provided by the University and makes living in Manhattan affordable,"" she said. Rents are standardized and are not determined by individual salary level, so that Columbia professors of all degrees have a fair chance at obtaining housing facilities at reasonable prices. However, newly tenured and recently hired faculty have priority in obtaining apartments. Also, professors with children are usually given larger units than single teachers. Other professorial perks at Columbia include a one-to-two-semester sabbatical leave after 12 semesters of teaching, teachers' assistants, grading assistants selected by the professors themselves, and laboratories and other space for research.• Summer research projects in foreign countries • Tax-free tuition exemptions for staff children • Free tuition for children who attend Columbia • Between $l,OOO and $2,000 per year for research • Equipment and traveling fees • Discounted local housing"
361,Music Humanities,New Mural Unveiled By Black Students' Group Former Club President Discusses Racism at Columbia,23 February 2007,"Former Club President Discusses Racism at ColumbiaBY MELISSA REPKO Spectator Staff WriterAbout 35 members of the Black Student Organization met in the Malcolm X Lounge last night to unveil a new mural and converse about what it means to be black at Columbia University today. The mural, which replaces the old one that was destroyed by water damage in the fall of 2005, features images of numerous black leaders and depicts two young, black people supportinga third as they walk up a stairway to the sky. It features red, orange, and yellow hues, blending together to form an inspirational scene. Dytonia Reed, CC 'O7 and publication chair of BSO, explained that she hoped the mural would portray that ""we are on the same path to progression."" Another member of BSO commented that it depicted the message, ""He's not heavy—he's my brother."" The path to finding the right artist to capturethe essence of the club's message was not as straightforward as planned. Reed was disappointed with the first muralist hired and said the result ""did not convey the message we wanted."" The second time around they found artist Chris Soria on CraigslisL Reed said that she collaborated with Soria and he based the mural off of her mocked-up sketch. ""When I was with Chris, 1 was frying to get him to see the vision,"" Reed said. ""I hope that when you come to the lounge and see the mural... you see we're not in it for ourselves. We are a community."" The gathering featured the founder and former president of BSO, Rufus Saddler, CC '77. After BSO members explained the organization's history and the mural, Saddler spoke of the BSO's beginnings, telling anecdotes about his college days. As he passed around a photo of the first BSO meeting, where students donned shades and sported afros, Saddler told about how they advertised for the gathering with flyers that read ""Mandatory Meeting of All Blacks."" Eighty-three students came. ""It actually meant something to be black,"" he said. 'We actually felt like it depended on us. ... Today, if you had a mandatory meeting for blacks, who would come?"" In addition to facing racial discrimination, Saddler said that many black students at Columbia in the '6os and '7os struggled with (economic challenges as well. He recalled calling his mother to tell her about the many luxuries of college life. ""Up here they had macaroni in different shapes and I didn't know if she knew that"" he said. When a member of the audience asked how he viewed the predominately white Core Curriculum, Saddler expressed mixed feelings. He said he was especially disappointed that Music Humanities did not cover jazz and dropped out ofthe class, though he eventually re-enrolled so he could graduate. ""You can fight it but you're not going to change it"" he said. ""Even though I kind of protested it I was glad about it [the Core], especially when I was in medical school."" Despite the struggles he sometimes faced on campus. Reed said that coming back made him nostalgic. ""Still, after 35 years, when I go through the gates it's like an intellectual wonderland,"" he said. ""1 still stand at the sundial and 1 always look underAlma Mater's skirt"" He stressed that students should continue to fight for what they believe in, whether by voting or protesting. ""Apathy is something that can kill you slowly,"" Reed said. Ultimately, Saddler and other executive board members expressed satisfaction with BSO's accomplishments since its founding in 1975. ""We have to look at this [the mural] and be thankful for this space,"" Jason Bello, CC 'OB and BSO historian said. 'We're part of this story. We're living it today.""BSO HISTORY | The Black Students Organization held an unveiling of a new mural in the Malcolm X lounge. The club's former president also spoke about race relations at Columbia in the '7os."

363,Music Humanities,"Stay Classical, Spectator",2 May 2007,"BY A.J. GOLD MANNThis column is in defense of what I've been doing for these past four years—arts criticism at a college paper. My beat has generally been the arts and has included reviews of films, art, music, and books. More specifically, I've been writing the classical music and opera criticism for this paper for the past four years. If the dearth of attention given to classical music this semester is any indication, it would seem that classical music coverage is being phased out of the Spectator. This is a shame because classical music is thriving on campus. This year especially, Columbia is increasingly at the center of the New York classical music scene. The Miller Theater has given us a particularly strong season and has made it into the mainstream press on several occasions, including the Oberlin Conservatory of Music's performance of Olga Neuwirth's Lost Highway and its programs of works by Frank Zappa and Edgar Varese. Additionally, Columbia retains good relations with Juilliardand the Manhattan School of Music. The CU Arts Initiative and Music Humanities have helped out by bringing the New York City Opera to campus. The Spectator should stop underestimating its readers and commit itself to covering more of these and other classical events throughout the city. I've come under attack from editors for writing articles directed toward a select audience about topics that don't really interest the rest of the Columbia community. But I'd like to think that my editors are simply underestimating my classmates. I think everyone would benefit from thinking seriously about arts criticism in general and the task of the critic. A critic must not only be able to tell his reader whether or not to see performance ""X,"" but a reviewer must also convince the reader that performance ""X"" is worth thinking about and why. I'm not recommending that critics keep their own subjective judgments in check, but rather, I suggest that they realize that praise and blame are only two elements of a good review. I suspect that many, like myself, who choose to contribute to the arts pages do so out a deep love for the subjects they write about and out of the conviction that art satisfies a deep and existential craving. As such, I'd like to thinkthat many are compelled to write about the arts out of more than an indulgent desire to flaunt their knowledge. Rather, I hope that many arts critics use writing as an opportunity to apply their deep love and respect for art, to try and communicate that conviction to others, and, at the same time, to refine their own understanding of what art means to them. Criticism at a college paper—and indeed everywhere—should be more than a simple thumbs-up or a one-to-five star-review. It should strive to elucidate and analyze. It should argue the case for art. Art is meaningful to us. This is both the premise of all good criticism and a belief that criticism needs to constantly reaffirm in order to stay alive and remain relevant. I hope that future arts journalists at the Spectator will understand that the arts page is more than a forum to air their own opinions and judgments. I hope that they realize that in their writing, they have a responsibility to communicate to their readers the worth of a particular work of art and of art in general. This is, and ought to be, the goal of all great criticism. The author is a Columbia College senior, double majoring in English and philosophy. He wrote classical music and opera reviews for the Spectator.SENIOR COLUMN"
364,Music Humanities,Survivng the Core,3 September 2007,"BY MARIA INSALACO Spectator Senior Staff WriterLove it or hate it, Columbia's Core Curriculum is a beast with which we must all do battle. With this in mind, here are some insider tips from up-per-classmen for conquering the Core, one class at a time. Literature Humanities • Like most literature classes, this one ( requires that you actually read the texts. Spark Notes can tell you that Achilles cannot control his pride and is driven by a desire for glory, but what can they tell you about Astyanax orAjax? . • Read your books with a highlighter. • The quotes on the final exams at the end of both semesters are the same for ALL classes, so even if your professor pointed out a few key lines in class, there may be other quotes on the test. Again, you have to read the books. University Writing • So much of this class depends on the instructor you get, so don't compare your grades to those of your peers. You'll either end up with an inflated ego or extremely frustrated. • Plan to finish your paper a few days early and see if your instructor will look at a draft. Similarly, once you get your paper back, see if you can rewrite it and turn in a new version. • Reviews about the Writing Center have been mixed. Some say it is the best way to get help on a paper, while others claim it's useless. If you're struggling with a paper, going to tire Writing Center once may be a good idea. Frontiers of Science » While everything is placed on a coursewide curve, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to do well in Frontiers, just the basics: go to the lectures, turn your homework in on time, and study for the final. • If science makes less sense to you than ancient Greek, try stopping by the Help Center or working with your seminar instructor. Gateway • Described by most SEAS students as an unavoidable evil, Gateway is a nit-picky, detail-ori-ented class that may leave you wondering how it actually prepares you for other engineeringclasses. The one piece of advice most SEAS students agreed on was to be sure that you perfectly understand instructions and that you follow them precisely on assignments. • Know how to navigate the Gateway Web site before Internet-based homework is assigned. Contemporary Civilization • You don't need to do all the reading. Wikipedia can be an invaluable tool in learning the main concepts for each work. • Don't skip class. Discussions are the foundations for exams and essays. Plus, missing class will really annoy your professors and make them more likely to grade your work harshly. If you have weekly discussion postings, suck it up and do them. • Study with classmates before exams. Make it a structured session where different people are assigned different works to present for review. While you might not understand Kant, one of your friends might have found him to be an easy read. Exchanging ideas will help you both. Major Cultures • These classes are reading-intensive, so don't mix them with Lit Hum and two history classes. • Don't tell your parents, but don't do all of the reading. Get to know others in the class, split assignments, and create short outlines. Skim with a highlighter and type notes during class. Before exams, gather as a group and make sure everyone is clear on the main concepts of each book or article. Warnng: this strategy only works if you diligently pursue it throughout the semester. Leaving it for two weeks before finals is a recipe for disaster. Art & Music Humanities • The extent to which these two classes are bearable (or maybe even enjoyable) depends entirely on finding a good professor and class time. If you work late on Sunday nights, taking a class on Monday at 9 a.m. is not the best plan, not matter how good the professor is. • Shop around. Register for this class each semester that you can get into it until you find an appropriate time slot and a good instructor. As always, you can find reviews of most professors on CULPA."
365,Music Humanities,"Here's to You, Jacques Barzun",2 October 2007,"There are Columbia professors, and there are Columbia institutions. Jacques Barzun is the latter. Undergraduate, provost, and everything in between, professor Barzun fundamentally redefined the Columbia experience through a half-century of dedicated service. Western, worldly, and undeniably brilliant, Barzun faithfully embodies the University's greatness. As we approach his 100th birthday, a personal centennial, it is worth reflecting on his many accomplishments—for his is truly a Columbian life. Born in Creteil, France and raised among Paris' avant-garde intellectuals, Barzun gave his first lesson at just nine years old in the midst of the First World War. As fate would have it, he has yet to stop. Sent first by his father to preparatory school in the United States, Barzun entered Columbia College in the mid-1920s. Matriculating at the top of his class ('27), Barzun began to teach formally while pursuing his Ph.D. ('32). This relationship lasted until 1955 when the University promoted him first to dean and later to provost. For the 13 long years until his return as University Professor in 1968, a position he held until his retirement in 1975, Barzun remained a central figure in the Columbia administration. His intellectual pursuits and academic record proved invaluable for an administrator dealing with a university in a time of great fluctuation. A naturally gifted writer, Barzun muses on all subjects from art and music to what mightquite possibly be the most challenging of all, writing itself. But never has he failed to include his trademark charm, lucidity, and insight. As a scholar, the young Columbian broke ground as the vanguard of an emerging new discipline, cultural history. The author of well over 20 books, Barzun shaped and guided the nascent field to popular acceptance and use. In short, he is just as much an academic giant beyond Columbia's gates as he is within. Barzun's last monumental work, the 800-plus-page survey of Western civilization a decade in the making, From Dawn to Decadence , stands as testament to that fact. The dark-horse New York Times bestseller introduced a new generation to the still-mesmerizing nonagenarian. Equal parts historian, anthropologist, philosopher, writer, and social critic, Barzun completed in his twilight years that which would take the rest of us a lifetime. Many on the transadantic right respect Barzuns generally positive attitudes toward Western culture and his desire to preserve its key elements. In his review of From Dawn to Decadence , Roger Kimball, the old-ppard editor of The New Criterion, calls Barzun ""a voice of moderation and sanity in American intellectual life for some six decades."" In 2003, President George W. Bush presented professor Barzun with his long-deserved Presidential Medal of Freedom, Americas highest civilian honor. With few exceptions, Barzun is the closest thing Columbia has to a conservative professor. And no, this isn't grounds to discount him. Rather, Barzun is emblematic of a different Columbia. Compared to todays professors-turned-pundits, a practice that would make any good Kantian weep, Barzun kept his studies and classroom apolitical. Instead he focused his energies on celebrating and sharing Western civilizations great texts. Barzun had a direct handin the creation of Humanities A, that which we so lovingly call Lit Hum, and proved a key supporter of two new programs, Art and Music Humanities. Columbian Thomas Vinciguerra perfectly captures Professor Barzun's quick wit as he describes one of the Core's earliest and shortest debates: Arguing against Music Humanities, ""Professor of music Douglas Moore roared, 'We don't want freshmen wiping their feet on Bach.' Barzun hastily retorted, 'Doug, freshmen have been wiping their feet on Shakespeare for years.' Moore immediately withdrew his objection."" Barzun's own class offerings were equally impressive. For decades he co-taught a graduate seminar with famed literary cridc Lionel Trilling. Known to the registrar as ""Historical Bases of English Literature,"" students called it something far more appropriate: ""Great Books."" It rightfully goes down in academic lore as one of the greatest courses ever offered—it was Columbia at its intellectual zenith. For many, its contemporary equivalent, a seminar with Vaclav Havel and Umberto Eco, wouldn't pose the slightest challenge. Long overdue, the Society of Columbia Graduates will present professor Barzun with the Great Teacher Award on Oct. 18th. While 1 haven't had the pleasure of meeting professor Barzun or reading all his work, there are coundess alumni, former students, and Barzun aficionados to put me in my place. They revere professor Barzun as not only an academic, but a naturally kind and good-hearted human being. In my eyes, there is no better compliment for a man who gave his life and career to Columbia. So here's to you, Professor Barzun. Happy 100 th birthday. • Chris Kulawik is a Columbia College senior majoring in political science. Chris Shrugged runs alternate Tuesdays.

366,Music Humanities,Systemic Racism Here?,2 November 2007,"BY JONATHAN HOLLANDERLike many other members of the Columbia community, 1 was shocked by the response to the recent bias incidents on campus. However, mv dismay did not result from the actions of the administration, but rather from those of my fellow students, some of whom have seized upon recent events and twisted their meaning to reflect an activist political agenda. Not only do I believe that this smacks of political opportunism, but more seriously, it demeans the importance of the cause—opposition to racism—that these individuals supposedly represent. The first point that needs to be addressed is the assertion that racism at Columbia is nor only pervasive, but also condoned and tacidy encouraged by the University. In his Spectator article ""Not Just an Isolated Incident"" (Oct. 26), Andrew TilletSaks listed four racist incidents—and alleged several more —that pointed to systemic bigotry within the Columbia community. He then , made the assertion that Columbia was responsible for these abhorrent acts because of the racist climate created by the Core Curriculum and the administrations insensitive response to hate crimes. Before we accept this statement at face value, we should first apply some rational scrutiny in order to determine both the scope of the problem and its causes. Lets begin by assuming for a moment that all four of the racist events listed by Mr. TilletSaks were undeniably perpetrated by members of the Columbia community, despite the lack of evidence substantiating this claim. Either way, four racist incidents since 2004 in a University of 20,000 hardly seem systemic and institutionalized. Moreover, this doesn't even take into account the student turnover at Columbia, which would increase the number of students (and possible bigots). Compared with hate-crime statistics for New York City as a whole, racism at Columbia isactually less common. Columbia has a rate of .02 percent hate crimes per person (assuming 4 crimes divided by 20,000 people), while the city average is .024 percent (1900 crimes between 2000 and 2004 divided by 8 million people). Additionally, one should consider that many of the crimes in the New York City statistic reflect incidents of murder and physical assault, actions that thankfully have not occurred at Columbia. Even though racism at Columbia is less pervasive than in the city as a whole, I, like most reasonable individuals, consider any instances of racism to be too many This is why it is important to understand the causes behind these actions. During my two years at Columbia, I have consistently heard many activists argue that racism at Columbia is the result of the cultural insensitivity of the Core, combined with the University's ""hostile"" policies toward both ethnic students and academic departments. If the causes of bigotry were actually this simple, however, I doubt racism would be as troubling an issue as it truly is. Firstly, the idea that the Eurocentricity of the Core creates bigotry is fallacious for several reasons. One of them is that the Core is not as Eurocentric as some activists would have us believe. The Core includes four classes that could be reasonably considered Eurocentric Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. However, this is offset by the two Major Cultures classes and four semesters of foreign languages, which are designed to be diver-sity-building elements. Yet, even if we do assume for a moment that the Core is Eurocentric, how does this engender racism? Are we to allege that every bigot on this campus is a student of4ooo-per-son Columbia College, spurred to action because of the cultural insensitivity of the Core? This question actually leads us to the larger issue of what motivates a racist. Does someone hang a noose on a door because they feel thatColumbia University's lack of funding to the Afri-can-American studies department legitimizes their anions? Or rather, is it because of emotional and social insecurity, isolation, and most importandy, ignorance? Ultimately, when we use reason—the foundation of CC—to examine these outrageous contentions, we quickly see that they are little more than crass political moves designed more to elicit emotion than rational discourse. The final point to consider is the University's attitude toward racism as a whole. Columbia's administration has been routinely attacked for its supposed intransigence in response to hate crimes. However, what exacdy would be an appropriate response? Would University President Lee Bollinger's presence at an anti-racism rally seriously make it any more effective? To assert that Lee Bollinger—the man who defended affirmative action in the Supreme Court—is not just insensitive to minority issues, but is actually a closet racist, is absurd. The administration's actions have been motivated by the correct belief that the appropriate response to hate crimes is to allow the police to investigate, apprehend, and prosecute the offenders. Fundamentally, Columbia University is not a racist institution. Slavery, segregation, and the Holocaust were all racist events—Manhattanville is not. Racism is a powerful charge, and just because activists need something to protest does not give them the right to makelibelous accusations against their own University. Hijacking issues and incidents by labeling them as examples of racism is a dangerous tactic. It not only limits the open discourse of our University community, but more importandy, it demeans the value of die term, so that when real racist events do occur, they don't receive the consideration they deserve.

367,Music Humanities,"University May Merge GS With CC After Years of Discussions, Integration Appears Likely",12 November 2007,"After Years of Discussions, Integration Appears LikelyBY VARUN GULATI AND DAVID XIA COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATORThe School of General Studies is moving toward a possible merger with Columbia College, according to a report issued in May by the Task Force on Undergraduate Education. The report was driven by a desire to integrate GS into the greater undergraduate community. It makes specific proposals to expand GS's financial aid and housing and to integrate the School's student services and admissions with those of CC and SEAS. The document suggests a merger with the College as one way of achieving this. ""Out of our discussion has emerged, if not yet a consensus, at least an interest in considering a new relationship between GS and the other undergraduate schools, one that could even lead to an actual merger of GS and the College,"" the Task Force, which is comprised of administrators, students, and faculty members from CC, SEAS, and GS, stated in a report presented at a May meeting. Many view the proposal—versions of which have been discussed several times since the 1980s —to be closer to realization than ever. The measure has substantial momentum from several administrators, who acknowledge that a closer relationship between the two schools would help GS recruit more and better applicants by providing larger financial aid packages, housing, and administrative resources. General Studies Student Council President Niko Cunningham, who sits on the Task Force, expressed confidence that students will see tangible effects of such talks. ""There are students here today that when they graduate from GS, their diploma will say something different than mine does."" ""The curricular differences are minor at this point, and we're going to be looking into whether we should collapsethat distinction altogether,"" Vice President of Arts and Sciences Nicholas Ditks said of the potential integration. A LOOK BACK The discussions mirror those from 13 years ago when administrators made a concerted effort to integrate SEAS and CC through the creation of a joint Office of Student Affairs under Dean Chris Colombo. The integration allowed SEAS to access a much larger pool of financial and administrative resources, a crucial step for allowing the school to grow, according to SEAS Interim Dean Gerald Navratil and SEAS Vice Dean Morton Friedman. In the past 10 years, the school has seen its applicant pool triple and has gone from admitting about half of all applicants.to a record-breaking 18 percent, while still increasing the size of its student body. While the 1994 move has been credited for improving relations and fostering a sense of community between SEAS and CC, administrators say that SEAS has maintained its own identity. Although undergraduates in SEAS and CC live in the same residence halls, have access to the same advising resources, and are allowed to register for many of the same classes, Navratil stressed that SEAS retains its own faculty and departments. ""The fact that we partner with the College where it's a mutual advantage doesn't mean we're 'merged,'"" he said. No final conclusions have been made as to what degree CC and GS would be integrated, but it is possible that the merger"" would mirror that of SEAS and CC from the 19905, where the integration would be limited to a bureaucratic reshuffling and light curricular changes. This shift might alleviate many of the concerns voiced by GS students. Cunningham said GS is excluded in many ways from the structural and social environment reserved for CC and SEAS. He cited housing, financial aid, and even the Office of Multicultural Affairs as concerns. ""While SEAS shares in centralized services with the College, the school [GS] has preserved a separate identity ... GS doesn't share any centralized services,"" Cunningham said. MAKING THE CASE Although the idea of greater integration has been raised repeatedly in the past, the recent discussions come in light of the fact that differences in curricula and faculty between GS and CC have increasingly diminished. According to Peter Awn, Dean of the School of General Studies, in 1995 the University decided to separate GS from the test of its continuing education programs. ""If you look at any other university, colleges for non-traditional students are always embedded within a continuing education ... environment.... Now you have a freestanding college for nontraditional students,"" Awn said. Originally, the differences in academic requirements between GS and CC were a product of separate faculties in the two schools, according to Awn, who added that during the 19705, Columbia was ""one of the most decentralized universities in the Ivy League."" It was not until the 1990s that the faculties for the Col-lege, GS, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences were united under the Faculty for Arts and Sciences, currently headed by Dirks. The report targets three areas of concern for the Task Force to address: uneven academic stature of GS students, isolation from the undergraduate education, and the inability of GS students to participate in the undergraduate curriculum in equal degree to those in CC. An alignment of the curricula followed the unification of the faculty. GS students, like their counterparts in the College, have Core requirements including Art Fdumanities, Music Humanities, and University Writing, and although it is not mandatory, they may sign up for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations. ""There used to be two separate curricula between the College and General Studies, and that's all been eroded,"" English and comparative literature Professor Michael Rosenthal said. He added that an evening curriculum for GS students who have jobs during the day has been eliminated. Thus far, the Task Force has advocated an even closer binding of the two curricula by recommending the addition of enough sections of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization to the current two sections available to GS students, estimating the cost to accommodate all who are interested at $1 million annually. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we find that within the next five years even the Core Curriculum is going to be identical,"" Awn said. SEPARATE IDENTITIES? Beyond academics, integration between GS and CC will potentially affect admissions, financial aid, housing, and student life. The Task Force report suggests integrating GS admissions with the Undergraduate Office of Admissions for CC and SEAS with the understanding that GS students are evaluated under different criteria that are still as rigorous as CC and SEAS admissions standards. Navratil said moving under the same Undergraduate Admissions Office had been largely beneficial for SEAS, and an admissions merger would probably benefit GS as well. ""They [GS] will have access to a large amount of resources, and can grow into a larger organization.... They might just use that as we've [SEAS] used it, to increase the quality of the students,"" he said. ""There's a lot of things you can do with a deeper applicant pool."" On the other hand, Awn said, ""I tend to think that's a bit of a ted herring because Columbia College does its own kind of admissions very well. They wouldn't know what to do in dealing with non-traditional students."" To further attract applicants and support GS students, administrators have discussed increasing financial aid, which lags behind that of its two peer undergraduate schools, and expanding University housing for GS students. ""Most of us are financially independent [from our parents], so we get a lot less [aid] than CC students. That's something most GS students are very bitter about,"" Natalie Johnston, GS, said. ""Any GS student would give up any otner benefit just for that [financial aid being combined]. I mean, I would. That's been my biggest problem and I feel like I've been somewhat deceived.""The Task Force recommended a hybrid financial aid package for GS in which students with parental contributions receive aid comparable to CC students with alternate packages for those without access to parental contributions. The report also suggested providing expanded University housing for GS. The Task Force concluded their report with the suggestion that, as happened with the creation of the Office of Student Affairs, GS student services could be integrated with those of CC and SEAS. Among CC and SEAS students, the idea of GS becoming more socially integrated generates some unease. Daniela Cassorla, CC 'lO, said she thinks inherent differences in age and life experiences between the student populations of GS and the other two schools necessitate a separation of the services and functions the schools provide. Administrators and students on the Task Force say they want to preserve what keeps GS unique while not impinging on the unique identities of CC and SEAS. ""GS has a unique feature of having a non-resident, part-time college experience,"" said Navratil, who added that a merger would not necessarily change the school's function or character. ""We don't want to amalgamate it [GS] in a way that causes it to lose its very special distinct functions and identity,' Dirks said. Further, Seth Flaxman, CC 'O7 and former CCSC president, said ""I'm more concerned about how well an institution serves people than the ideological purity of the institution itself,"" adding that the proposal ""does not mean that every CC student's apocalyptic fear of old people stalking their dorm hallways will come to life."" ""If you really believe that nontraditional students who want a very traditional Ivy League education and who are as intellectually capable as any other undergrad,"" said Awn, "" if you think they add an important dimension to the intellectual discourse and the community life of this University, then we should embrace them as equals."" CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS A potentially significant factor for administrative integration is decreased costs, Rosenthal pointed out. ""It may be that if you combine the two [GS and CC], you cut out a layer of administrative expense,"" he said. Flaxman agreed, saying, ""This could be a really cheap way to expand the College without putting more students into classrooms, thus allowing us to be more competitive against Princeton, Yale, and Harvard."" Dirks responded to such comments, saying that ""It's not about downsizing.... It's about customizing the way in which we do these things so that we do it better."" Additionally, Cunningham said he believes that, at least in the short run, there will be increasing costs associated with the integration. ""There's an infrastructural cost that is undeniable. We have to hire more professors, get more seats in class for core classes.... There will be a lot of growing pains,"" he said.

368,Music Humanities,Editorial Shut Out Schools should standardize registration for seminars,24 January 2008,"Shut OutSchools should standardize registration for seminarsClass.registration is a stressful process that requires students to balance Core Curriculum and major requirements with the need to create manageable schedules. The process is made more complicated by the absence of a standard system for signing up for seminars. Students often do not find out if they are in seminars until after preregistration is closed, or even until the classes are under way, and must reorganize their schedules as a result. Columbia's undergraduate schools should implement standardized procedures to simplify seminar registration. The registration procedures for seminars vary from major to major, and sometimes even within departments. Students planning to take seminars in the political science department are often frustrated by their inability to preregister for seminars—instead, they must receive instructor approval within the first two weeks of class and then fill out Add/Drop forms. Registration for economics seminars began on the first day of classes this semester, but juniors and some seniors cannot register for them until the second week. The registration protocols for seminars in other departments range from registering on SSOL to registering in person outside professors' offices. Enrolling in Culture of Public Art and Display in New York City, a popular anthropology seminar, required each student to sign up on a list, complete an Add/Drop form, and register on SSOL. These different protocols are unnecessarily confusing and inconsistent across departments. When students are rejected from seminars after classes have started, replacement classes may already be full. Since students cannot register simultaneouslyfor courses whose class times overlap — even if only by 15 minutes —trying to register for a seminar can preclude a student from registering for Backup courses that occur at the same time. Indeed, because seminars are typically longer than lecture classes, they interfere with more than one time slot. To remedy this situation, departments should move seminar registration earlier in the semester the course is being taught, or allow preregistration for juniors and seniors. Columbia and Barnard phased in promising registration reforms this semester, and the same principles should be applied to seminars. Responding to concerns that underclassmen have been shut out of Art and Music Humanities, the Center for the Core Curriculum moved the drop deadline for these classes forward to prevent upperclassmen from tying up spots that they are likely to drop later. Seminar spots are similarly scarce and similarly sought-af-ter, so imposing an early drop deadline for seminars would help ensure that no seminar seats go to waste. Additionally, the Barnard and Columbia registrars are working to put registration for Barnard's L-courses online through the eßear website —a welcome alternative to waiting in line at the registrar's office to register in person. Seminar registration is still done by paper in many departments, and as with L-courses, online registration is long overdue. Although the University has mitigated some of the unnecessary inconveniences that students face during registration, seminar registration must still be addressed. Seminar space will remain scarce whatever is done, but the Byzantine procedures currently in place make the problem far worse."
369,Music Humanities,"College Offers Mini-Courses for Far-Flung, Nostalgic Alumni",27 March 2008,"BY KATIE DUNN Columbia Daily SpectatorAs Columbia College students reluctandy settle back in from spring break, they might be surprised to hear that their predecessors are eagerly signing up for a chance to revisit the Core Curriculum. The Columbia College Alumni Association launched a program last spring to offer to alumni clusters of classes based on Columbia courses including Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Frontiers of Science. Each mini-course is more than simply a Sparknotes- style refresher. Rather than following curricula prescribed by their on-campus colleagues, faculty members work specifically to apply the texts they teach to todays society. According to Executive Director of Alumni Affairs Ken Catandella, one of the programs key organizers, a given class might ""take Hobbes, Voltaire, and Plato, and apply them to the free market economy."" ""The mini-courses try to take the essence of the core and apply it to die reality of the world for alumni,"" Catandella said. Organizers see this approach as an important tool in making courses designed for college freshmen relevant to more seasoned learners. ""Their [alumni's] perspective on life when they read these materials is a little bit different, because they've been out of school and have actually had more real life experience,"" Executive Assistant of Alumni Affairs Mia Gonsalves explained. The program began two years ago, when three brief core reviews were offered at a Columbia College reunion. The enthusiastic response led to the creation of mini-courses last spring. The sessions are currendy offered in New York and Washington, D.C., and an abbreviated, one-class pilot program is being planned for Chicago this spring. More cities may soon follow. Deborah Martinsen, associate dean of Columbia College and lecturer for one such course, attributes the alumni demand for mini-classes to whatshe calls ""Core nostalgia"" and ""Core envy."" The latter, she said, expresses the sentiments of alumni members' friends and spouses, who complain they lack the critical-thinking skills the Core is designed to impart. Currently, the program is open to all CC alumni, who are also free to sign up their spouses and friends. Martinsen noted that her last class included a wide range of ""alumni from the class of 1951 to the class of 2005."" Catandella also proposes another reason for alumni interest in the mini-courses—that they provide intellectual engagement with the academic interests of todays undergraduates. ""They [alumni in the program] feel connected to what the students are doing currendy,"" he said, citing the offering of recent Cote addition Frontiers of Science, which was not available to many of the alumni involved in the program. Unlike those taught in Hamilton, the minicourses are a veritable bargain —$150 for three sessions, which typically include a small meal. In the midst of the Capital Campaign, the major CC fundraising drive launched last fall, organizers said they hope that the program Will also encourage donations. ""This really is a relational activity, although I suspect that happy alums and engaged alums are more likely to be donors,"" Catandella said. ""In that respect, I imagine it's connected. It's not really an outcrop of the campaign."" The often-bimonthly sessions last two hours each and typically occur in the evenings at the volunteered offices of alumni participants. Much like Core classes taught at the University, classes consist of small groups of 20 to 25 alumni. While the classes will not count toward any degree or certificate, Catandella said alumni receive a different sort of compensation. ""When alumni are able to be challenged again by the Cote Curriculum at the place in their lives that they ate today,"" he explained, ""there is a real sense of coming home, intellectually coming home."" news@columbiaspectator. com"
370,Music Humanities,CALENDAR,25 April 2008,"Friday, April 25Found Footage Festival ""Found art"" refers to objects that nobody would think of as artistically significant —that is, until some prophet places them in a new context, creating a new perspective on items we see everyday. Marcel Duchamp's Fountain —a urinal—comes to mind, as does a recent Yale graduate's display of, um, her placental fluids. These pieces confront us with an everyday experience —slightly altered —and the ensuing chaos shatters our worldview into a million tiny pieces, allowing us i to see the universe with fresh eyes and upturned faces. Or at least that's the intention. The Found Footage Festival promises to be slightly less visionary, thankfully. First of all, the festival won't use half its time arguing about the definition of an artistic medium. Cinema is cinema, and this collection of movie footage is indeed footage. No nasty surprises. The only caveat: the festival picked up its material in weird places, including old home movies that were ""donated to Goodwill."" Clearly, it one donates the footage of one's birthday party to a thrift store, one deserves to have one's private life screened in front of hundreds of New Yorkers, set to the hilarious commentary of wacky curators (Mystery Science Theater 3000, anyone?).

371,Music Humanities,Youth Voices on Lockdown,10 April 2009,"Here's the whole hype: While we love our historical survey courses and Music Humanities, until this semester we had never seen a Columbia class break out of the comfortable campus environment; most classes focus instead on students' acquisition of multiple majors and the entire Western philosophical canon. Despite our many activities outside of class, Columbia is insular by design. This semester, through a course called Youth Voices on Lockdown, our routine has been shattered by the opportunity tp spend eight Fridays at the Robert Davoren Correctional Facility on Rikers Island. Youth Voices allows us to share our privileged education with incarcerated youth, who in turn share their experiences with us. This class, offered through the AfricanAmerican studies department, puts threeperson Columbia student-teaching teams with groups of about ten adolescent boys at Rikers. Each week we prepare two-hour lesson plans designed to create an environment where the students can empower themselves through knowledge and discussion. At 6:30 we meet outside the jail, and from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday evenings we hold our workshops in a special section of the adolescent dorms. Our strategy is borrowed from the work of Paolo Freire, who advocated a reciprocal educational process. Instead of teachers deigning to hand down the authoritative word, the teachers and students engage in dialogue that promotes student self-em-powerment. Facilitators don't privilegetheir opinions over those of the students, but instead encourage students to probe more deeply into their own ideas and motivations. We try to move our discussions beyond superficial explanations so students can get to the origins of their opinions and begin to see causal relationships. In our last workshop, one student told us that he favored violence in the face of oppression. We asked him to be more specific, and he explained that he felt there was oppression against his community that justified violence in response. The exchange led to an intense debate about appropriate responses to oppression, and we left the workshop feeling that some really important issues had been addressed in a way that resonated deeply with the students. It's not easy to tell whether speaking with those students in their jail dormitory benefited them as much as it did us. Our teacher, Tongo Eisen-Martin, told us that ""Columbia students always get more out of this than Rikers students,"" and he may be right. But throughout this semester, we have been striving to build on the foundations laid by former Youth Voices participants. We have the benefit of their experience, and we hope that by putting their advice to good use we can improve the program for next time. If there is a next time. Youth Voices on Lockdown may be among the casualties of our magically shrinking endowment. The potential elimination of Youth Voices hurts two parties: Columbia students become further insulated, and Rikers students are deprived of an educational resource. Youth Voices on Lockdown provides an opportunity for the University budgeters to show that they are interested not only in promoting academic and finance skills, but also in what is done with those skills. Columbia students in the class mobilize their skills for someone else's benefit and gain the chance to participate in a semester-long dialoguewith adolescents who have not crossed che 116 th Street threshold. Through its dialogue, the class understandably, sparks outrage in its Columbia participants. Jail stigmatizes its inhabitants —even Columbians who have dutifully studied the prison-industrial complex and railed against the injustices of the U.S. court system see this. News reports and academic articles often talk in numbers. We met kids. And they're young —not quite old enough for college but old enough to no longer be juveniles in the eyes of New York law. At a time when it has become fashionable to try children as adults, we've been overwhelmed by the feeling that there must be some mistake. How could the system have lost hope on these smart, energetic kids? How could our students be judged societal refuse at the age of 15? What does anyone gain by throwing young people into a jail instead of a place where they can learn something? These kids didn't grow up in a vacuum—they're products of their environments, just like everyone else. Who knows whether we'd be at Columbia without the Advanced Placement classes and guidance counselors? Classes like Youth Voices on Lockdown give us the chance to confront these issues directly. The class is a challenge to our assumptions and, at the risk of sounding trite, it broadens our perspectives. This is the Jype of program Columbia should be celebrating and smacking on the cover of Columbia Magazine. Eliminating Youth Voices would be right in line with the University's tendency toward insularity and away from meaningful exchange with other young people. Prove us wrong.

372,Music Humanities,"ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT Under new direction, Miller gets hip",10 September 2009,"Under new direction, Miller gets hipBY CHRISTINE JORDAN Spectator Staff WriterBY-CHRISTINE JORDAN Spectator Staff Writer If the last time you went to Miller Theatre was for a Frontiers of Science lecture, don't tell Melissa Smey. The new director of Miller Theatre—Columbia's preeminent venue for the performing arts—isn't oblivious to undergraduates' general underutilization of the institution. But that doesn't mean she's complacent about it. ""I'm excited about the opportunity to build stronger connections within the university,"" she said in an interview, and ""with what's happening on the campus."" Smey s vision for Miller integrates undergraduates into its programming by bringing hip performers to campus,continuing to showcase student musicians, and by hosting events that are widely accessible to the uninitiated. After eight years as general manager of Miller, Smey is still itching to develop new program ideas and to create unexpected juxtapositions in her new capacity as director. According to students, Smey may have her work cut out for her. Many feel that in the past few years, Miller has not targeted undergraduates in publicizing their events, leaving students like Joy Lee, CC 'l2, ignorant of its programming. ""If I looked at what Miller Theatre was offering, I could probably find something that I would like to attend, but right now, I just have no idea what's going on,"" said Lee. New student Antonio Pineda, SEAS 'l3, felt a similar disconnect from the venue. ""This is actually the first time I've ever heard of the place,"" he said. But Smey and other Miller employees plan to strengthen the venue's ties to Columbia this year, beginning with a renewed partnership with the School of the Arts. In the undergraduate world, Smey hopes to expand an affiliation that may not be as tenuous as some students think At a Bach concert last October, Smey noted that between 130 and 140 of the 688 audience memberswere Columbia undergraduates—with some thanks to an assignment required of Music Humanities students. On average, Smey said, students from Columbia and other universities typically comprise about 20 to 25 percent of the audience. But how, exactly, can that figure grow, especially to a point where Miller can develop a visible presence in campus culture? According to Smey, the theater must create and actively continue programs that build audiences—audiences that include even those who, at the moment, barely know what Miller Theatre is. With her experience and own eclectic tastes, Smey hopes to create programmingwith particular appeal to younger audiences. ""Radiohead is like my favorite band ever... and I'm going to listen to them alongside Righetti and ... Pierre Boulez,"" she said. ""It seemed reasonable to me that other people would be flexible as well in their listening."" Smey hopes this flexibility and innovation is apparent already in Miller's 2009 season. This week's Wordless Music Meets Miller Festival, for example, will feature indie artists like Do Make Say Think and Dan Bejar of Destroyer alongside classical musicians. ""The Wordless Music Festival is my first chance to have a try at a new programming ideas,"" she said, adding that it is one of the items in the season that is entirely her own initiative. Smey's relationship with the Wordless Music Series, which brings together indie rock and contemporary classical musicians, began years ago. Just last spring, Miller hosted two events in conjunction with Wordless Music—the performances of the experimental electronic duo The Books and German electronic artist Wolfgang Voigt. ""People were even scalping tickets on Craigslist,"" Smey said of the two events. ""It would be awesome if at all of our concerts that kind of energy was present."" Smey hopes undergraduates will again be excited for the arrival of indie and electronic groups, and that Wordless MeetsMiller will serve as a ""first introduction to Miller as a great asset to the campus."" But in addition to creating new programs that appeal to students in new ways, Smey plans to continue to cultivate Miller as an asset to student performers and alumni in the performing arts. The venue has been a longtime home for the groups of the Columbia Performers Partnership, which includes organizations like the Columbia Classical Performers and gives them the opportunity to hold high-profile concerts at Miller. For Eric Silberger, CC 11, president of the Columbia Classical Performers, a third year violinist in the Barnard-Columbia-Juliard joint degree program, and the BCJ Series Organizer for Miller Theatre, having performances on campus is an incentive to get his peers involved in his art. ""The acoustics of the hall require exaggeration of musical ideas in order to communicate, and if successful, the space, although large, can become rather intimate,"" Silberger said. ""Especially after the concert, it is very common to find the performers and audience chatting together."" Miller will also host its third year of free lunchtime concerts this season, which will include the work of cellist Alisa Weilerstein, CC 'O4. Smey cites that the concerts are so highly attended because they remove common barriers to attendance like ticket price and time of day for students and city-dwellers alike. New York City, in fact, has forced Miller to create a niche of its own to avoid competition with giants like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center for musicians, audiences, and funders. ""What that means is that these are programs that you can't hear anywhere else,"" Smey said of Miller. Aware of her ability to guide the performing arts at Columbia, Smey said that she's grateful to be ""part of the team that's now considering where the arts are going collectively."" But as to where, exactly, that is, she could only speak for Miller: ""It'll be great,"" she joked. ""It's going to take over the world!""MELISSA SMEY DIRECTOR OF MILLER THEATRE"
373,Music Humanities,What's your GPA?,24 September 2009,"An hour and a half of remedial math, some teenagers struggling to perform at grade level, some understimulated, everyone bored, an incompetent teacher who delegates the responsibility for class control and pedagogy to her more able, I mean more obsequious, students—and it's universally mandatory until the end of the semester. Public high school? Hell no—this was Frontiers of Science, and what I described above constituted my very first step into the Styx of higher education. Looking back on it, learning anything from the class was out of the question. My seminar leader was wretched, and education for the sake of education is simply not possible when there's a requirement that nearly everyone hates. I could have gotten something out of it, though: a grade; so I'm only a little embarrassed that after discovering I got a B-plus—-this after a late burst of sitting in the front, evincing interest, completing 'independent projects,' 'taking the initiative,' pretending to buy into 'peer learning,' and attaching clip-art to my homework—l considered transferring. This might have been good for Columbia and me, but I was rejected from everywhere I wanted to go because my grades were mediocre. It's like how SEAS will let you bow out, but you have to have the grades to do it. Many of my later bad grades have been my own fault, but not all of them. Learningshould always be the goal of a class. But if requirements curb curiosity and force venality, then they should at least be equitable in their student assessments. They aren't. CULPA pages are littered with reviews attesting to this. The grades issue is, I'm sure, tied to another way in which requirements are bungled: grad students. Grad students teach Art Humanities, Music Humanities, University Writing, and some teach Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations too, not to mention the introduction classes for your major. We might as well throw away the pretense that these are the most important classes of college if full professors aren't teaching them. But grad students —speaking very broadly—are bad in another way. They grade oddly and capriciously, more on effort than capability. An A-minus and a B-plus are often the only available marks. Everyone is above average, but only by so much. I suspect this is based on insecurity. Grad students are the antithesis of'too cool for school.' A friend and I conducted a post-mortem of our Art Hum instructor. He said that ""she was a tough grader for someone who didn't demonstrate very acute intelligence."" There has to be some way of demonstrating their superiority. It comes at the undergrads' expense —we are, after all, the paying customers. A less pressing issue is the imbalance in grades between different departments. Your GPA can be determined more by your major than by your talent and effort. This could be cut down by eliminating the A-plus. Which other school has these? They flourish only in our quantitative departments. All our valedictorians and salutatorians come from fields that give lousy speeches. If your abilities are really so remarkable, an A should be enough, and ifyou're working hard enough to get an A-plus, you're wasting your time. Academic success should come as a happy accident—not from hours of miserable travail. After applying a certain amount of effort, you start to hit diminishing returns. A race to the top in GPA is a race to the bottom in learning. This brings me to the problem at hand. Your GPA is a poor metric of what you got out of your experience, and an even poorer one for what you will get out of future experiences. This wouldn't be a concern if Professor Peter Bearman's cliche that 'your grades in college do not matter' was true. But it isn't. Bearman assigns them anyway, and they do matter —for grad school, for jobs, for whatever you will do after college. People talk a lot about grades at Columbia. The proof of their primacy is in the talking. On my visits to Reed, Pomona, and Amherst, the topic has been taboo—they are as meaningless and as seldom talked about as SAT scores. But our culture here has much more in common with a big, public research university than a small liberal arts college. The Darwinian market of New York exerts its workaholic pull. We are encouraged to compare ourselves to others, not others to ourselves, and find one or the other wanting. 'Comparisons are odious,' goes the old platitude. But what else do we have? 1 think the big lesson here is that people care about grades here as a means of asserting themselves over an experience over which they may have very little control.

374,Music Humanities,Lit Hum a year later,16 November 2009,"BY NEIL FITZPATRICKMuch has been said about the Core. It provides a firm grounding in the Western canon. It contains too many dead white males. It is a perfectly good cause for a hunger strike. It is one of the reasons that many students (including yours truly) came to Columbia. The Columbia College bulletin calls it ""the cornerstone of a Columbia education."" My roommate calls it ""a royal pain in the ass."" One of the things not often said about the Core, however, is that it is useful. The bulletin does offer that ""the skills and habits honed by the Core—observation, analysis, argument, imaginative comparison, respect for ideas, nuances, and differences —provide a rigorous preparation for life as an intelligent citizen in today's complex and changing world."" And this is true. University Writing could make you a better writer, and Lit Hum will certainly teach you how to read and analyze quickly (or at least improve your Sparknoting skills). But one might argue that the skills and values supposedly instilled by the Core —analysis, argument, respect for diverse ideas—could just as easily be imbued by an alternative course of study—say, one found at any of the other top universities. The fact is that it is the content of the Core that sets it apart, and the content of the Core which most people would hesitate to call ""useful."" The content of which I write is that of the first four courses introduced to the curriculum—Contemporary Civilizations, Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. They are classes chiefly concerned with the Western canon, and expose students to many of the great thinkers, writers, musicians, and artists of the Western world. The question is why. I am not, by any means, equipped to fully answer that question. As a sophomore, I have only completed one of the aforementioned classes: Lit Hum. Only time and chance will determine just how useful an education in the Core proves to be in the adult world of job markets and families. I can, however, attest to how useful the content of Lit Hum has been during my as-yet brief time in college. It began first semester freshman year, when I yialked into Modern Poetry, which I chose Bfe'iHiseTli'ked tWo of the poets mentioned in the course description, and not because I knew they were ""modernists,"" or because I had any real idea of what ""modernism"" was. The first lecture was a wake-up call—the first sign that my college education would be very, very different from my experience in high school. It took about two more sessions before the material stopped going over my head, and three more after that before I worked up the courage to raise my hand and participate. Most significant, though, was that as the semester wore on, my ability to analyze the poetry improved not just because I had been listening to my professor do analysis for months, but also because the works I was reading in Lit Hum were directly referenced in much of the modernist poetry we were studying. So when I came upon poems by Yeats like ""Adam's Curse"" or ""No Second Troy,"" my knowledge of Genesis and The Iliad helped me understand the context of the poems better than I ever could have from only reading the footnotes. The same was especially true later when we came to Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, both of whom referenced Homer, Ovid, and Dante so much that William Carlos Williams got sick of it all and decided to give the poet's version of a slap in a face by referencing a red wheelbarrow and some chickens. At least, I think that's what I was supposed to take away from the class. The education we are getting here with the Core—this grounding in the Western canonis not just knowledge that helps you seem smart at the proverbial cocktail party. Classes like Lit Hum add context to and enrich our education going forward. Even this year, in Contemporary Civilizations, Machiavelli references battles and historical figures straight out of Homer, Herodotus, and Thucydides. In Music Hum, we learn that Wagner, in writing opera, wanted to harken back to what he believed were the glory days of Ancient Greece, when, in the dramas we read in Lit Hum, all of the arts—literature, drama, music, dance, and gymnastics —were fused into one mode of expression. In psychology, we learn that Aristotle, of all people, could be considered the father of that field of study. Of course, one might argue that the content of the Core is only useful to people taking courses in the humanities, or only in the setting of other Core classes. And this is true to a certain degree—the literature read in Lit Hum may be more immediately useful to an aspiring English major than a math major. But to a large extent, the content of the Core offers context not just for ideas encountered in later academic settings, but also for the ideas that govern our world—why we study math, why we search for truth, how to best govern a state, how we can learn from history, what the purpose of art is, etc. It is this context which could be said to be the goal of education, the opposite of ignorance. It is what will allow us, both in our lives as college students, and perhaps even later in that world of job markets and families, to make informed decisions about any problems that cross our paths. And if, in the meantime, it helps me be a little less stupefied by ""The Wasteland""—well, I will take that too. The author is a Columbia College sophomore."
375,Music Humanities,"Course registration a challenge, General Studies seniors say",24 March 2010,"BY MADINA TOURE Spectator Senior Staff WriterSeniors in the School of General Studies say course selection comes with an added burden: the possibility of losing spots to underclassmen. At GS, there is no seniority in picking courses, a system students say makes it difficult to get into upper-level courses required for graduation. Students are instead randomly assigned times to sign up for classes. For some, this has proven to be problematic. General Studies Student Council President Katherine Edwards said that she tried to take Corporate Finance, a class for her major, but was unable to get in. ""Even as a senior I am not taking it, because both times I tried to register, it was entirely full,"" she said. And to get into another classthat fulfilled a core and major requirement —and enabled her to take one less class, saving her $3,000 since GS students pay per credit—she had to get help from the professor. ""Some are upset on mere principle that as a senior they do not have a first-day appointment, and I can certainly understand that,"" GS Dean of Students Scott Halvorson wrote in an email. ""I do not know of any students, however, for whom accommodations could not be made if a class was shown to be absolutely essential to the student's graduation within a particular term."" ""It poses a problem especially for people like me who have had to have a full-time job and take class, which means there are only a select few classes into which I can register,"" Garrett Blair, GS, said. The GS Committee on Instruction has been dealingspecifically with the issue. Ben Totushek, GS and one of two students on the COI, said they are currently working with profes-sors and administrators to raise awareness about problems with registration. ""We think that its gonna get the support it needs,"" he said. ""This system has been in place for a while now,"" Halvorson wrote. ""Some years ago we didexplore using the tier system, but we did not implement it because we did not think it would work as well as the current system for most of our students. We are certainly open, however, to exploring this possibility once more."" Lena Park, GS, said that students also face difficulties if they miss the pre-registration period randomly assigned to them. ""If you miss pre-registration, then you get screwed a lot and your choices get diminished,"" she said. There are some exceptions. Seniors trying to get into a Core class or first-years who missed the initial registration time are given priority registration. Halvorson also said that the Core office keeps sections of Art and Music Humanities open for seniors, and that students can consult the department for upper-level courses required for graduation. But Totushek said that students run into other difficultiesbecause they are unable to drop courses after the 10-day shopping period, while CC students can wait until after the first midterm. Park said that as a student who came to GS as a senior, more information about the registration process would have been helpful. ""Everyone assumes if you're a senior, you know this [the registration process] by now,"" she said, adding that the administration should ""recognize that we're all coming from different places."" Ultimately, Edwards said the system places GS seniors at a disadvantage. ""Once you get more up-and-up by your senior year, you should be able to get into what classes you want to take,"" she said, ""and I think it's really unfortunate because at GS, you don't have that luxury."" madina.toure @columbiaspectator.com""Some are upset on mere principle that as a senior they do not have a first-day appointment,"" —GS Dean of Students Scott Halvorson"
376,Music Humanities,Lit Hum and the examined life,10 September 2010,"BY CHRISTIA MERCERPlato tamously wrote in Apology : An unexamined life is not worth living"". If Plato is right, then Lit Hum encourages students and instructors alike to live a worthwhile life. Yeah, that's right, a worthwhile life. The official name of Lit Hum is Literature Humanities: Masterpieces of Western Literature and Philosophy. Unsurprisingly, Lit Hum readings pose significant philosophical questions. What shapes a worthwhile life? How do suffering and loss play a role? What temptations lead us astray? How does the agency of human beings differ? How and why are some people (e.g., women, servants, slaves) denied agency? How do family, friends, or divine being(s) limit life's options? What role do family, friends, or even art and story telling play in a worthwhile life? In the end, what is a worthwhile life good for? The texts of Lit Hum offer radically different responses to these questions. The answers of the ""Iliad"" are not like those of Augustine's ""Confessions"" or Montaigne's ""Essays,"" much less those of Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse."" There is an intellectual challenge at the heart of Lit Hum. Why should we care about the bratty guys disagreeing with one another at the outset of the ""Iliad,"" and why should we engage with a culture that treats women like these brats treat Briseis? The challenge is to push through such offensive features to discover the sophisticated fictionalized world beneath. Once we acknowledge the complexity of the poem's moral universe, we are able to recognize its subtlety and beauty. In the poem's sixth hook, we journey with Hector out of the war zone into the comforts of Troy, and then join him in conversation with his wife, Andromache. Not only has Andromache lost her parents and siblings to an earlier war, but she sees clearly what willhappen if Troy is defeated. In portraying her moral insight as she asks her husband to attend to the needs of his family and city rather than seek a warrior's glory, Homer offers a stark picture of what will happen if Troy falls. When Hector admits that he cannot ""shrink aside from fighting,"" we join Andromache in mourning the future devastation of this marvelous city and the certainty of her enslavement. As offensive as aspects of the story are to us, the losses, loyalties, and loves of this collapsing world are compellingly familiar. In the end, the poem does become a story about us. This tension between the unfamiliar and the familiar is the challenge of Lit Hum. The trick is to take seriously the remoteness of the values of our texts while recognizing ourselves within them. We have to walk a fine line. If we make our readings too much about us, we lose what they are; if we only examine them as archeological objects, their relevance for us today is diminished. But how exactly does all of this Lit Hum speak to Plato's point about the unexamined life? By asking us to explore a series of fictionalized moral universes, Lit Hum asks us to examine each carefully. We learn about different ways of being in the world, about different ways of living a human life. Not only do we compare these diverse universes, we eventually reflect on our own. The comparison between their values and ours elicits an analysis of our own lives. Before we know it, we are examining our moral universe and our place in it. If Plato is right and an unexamined life is not worth living, then Lit Hum does encourage us to live a worthwhile life. To help with our examination of Lit Hum texts, as well as our own self-examination in relation to them in the 21st century information age, we have created a Lit Hum website. The Fall Semester's materials will be launched this Sunday, Sept. 12. The site has three maingoals—to offer background materials related to the assigned readings, to include centuries of responses to Lit Hum works, and to build better connections between Lit Hum and other parts of the Core Curriculum. There are resources drawn from theater, music, opera, dance, visual arts, and much more. Many of these are taken from the materials of Art and Music Humanities. For example, Bernini's ""Rape of Persephone"" is a striking marble rendition of the first lines of ""Hymn to Demeter"" while Henry Purcell's ""Dido and Aeneas"" offers an important operatic treatment of the fourth book of ""The Aeneid"". One of the most exciting parts of the website is that it includes performances of plays (e.g., Peter Hall's production of Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon"" and Mark Cullingham's version of Euripides' ""Medea""), musical responses to our texts (e.g., Luigi Cherubini's opera, ""Medee"", and Simon Indelicate's ""The Book of Job: The Musical!""), and edgy pop-cultural renditions. Be sure you check out Hedwig (from John Cameron Mitchell's ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") singing Aristophanes' speech in the ""Symposium,"" Tom Lehrer's song about Oedipus Rex, and Led Zeppelin's ""Achilles' Last Stand."" Lit Hum can impact our lives in profound ways. Our website increases the chances for self-examination by asking us to confront the unfamiliar and familiar and compare our responses to generations of readers. If we let it, Lit Hum will change our lives. If we let it, our snazzy new Lit Hum website will encourage us all to think differently about our texts and to examine ourselves in relation to them life.

377,Music Humanities,Literature Humanities website gets makeover,24 September 2010,"BY AMBER TUNNELL AND SCARLETT TOHME Columbia Daily SpectatorLiterature Humanities has now arrived in the 21st century. The website for Lit Humone of Columbia's trademark Core courses—has previously only given basic information about the class. Now, after a full-blown makeover, the website features images, paintings, video clips, and audio files that complement the works read in class. The change is meant to make the course more engaging for students, said ChristiaMercer, the chair of Lit Hum and a professor of philosophy, who oversaw the overhaul. For example, for Plato's ""Symposium,"" the site has a clip from of the song ""the Origin of Love"" from the film ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" where a singer sings a song based on Aristophanes' speech about love. ""I want to combine intellectual seriousness with edginess,"" Mercer said. ""We want to make Lit Hum intellectually cool."" Elizabeth Bonnette, a Ph.D. candidate who is teaching Lit Hum this year, said she plans to utilize the website in herclass through weekly responses which incorporate a piece of art from the site. Bonnette said her class recently started ""Gilgamesh"" and that she liked how students could actually watch videos of people carving on tablets—the manner in which the work was originally written. ""It's going to be nice for them to explore things we don't get to in class,"" Bonnette said. The Lit Hum website is also meant to encourage connections with other required Core classes, such as Art and MusicHumanities, by including pieces of art and music relevant to the Lit Hum syllabus. ""I think people who teach Art Hum don't know as much about Lit Hum as they should,"" Mercer, who has taught both, said, explaining that the site will help bridge that gap. The site also has a comprehensive timeline for the material covered in the Core classes, which will help them understand what was going on in the other disciplines at the time the Lit Hum works were written. Susan Boynton, the chair of Music Hum and a music professor, said that Music Hum plans to also use the new site to establish connections between literature and music. ""In the interest of creating more intersections betweenthe Core courses, we hope in the future to link from the Lit Hum page to related materials for Music Hum,"" Boynton said in an email. There are also additions that only faculty can see, such as example questions, exams, and grading criteria. The extra resources are meant to make it easier for the faculty, who come from a range of fields—from Italian to religion to Slavic languages—to teach the works to students. Mercer also hopes this will convince more senior faculty to get involved with the course by making it easier to teach. ""I think this new website will help those of us who live outside the literature world get into the classics mind-set,"" Anna Couturier, CC 'lO, who helped Mercer organize the material for the site over the summer, said in an email fromBerlin, where she is studying. ""It will also give the Columbia community an opportunity to discuss ... the strengths and weaknesses of the core,"" she said. While resources for only the first semester's materialhave been added, Mercer said they are now going to work on the second semester of the course. Then, next year, the University plans to work onthe website for Contemporary Civilization, the yearlong philosophy course all Columbia College sophomores are required to take. Not all students were enthused. Adie Wadles, CC'l4, has never heard of it. ""I didn't hear of the new website, and I wouldn't go on it. And I probably wouldn't really care about it,"" Wadles said. Olivia Harris, CC 'l4, was more excited about the change. ""I would use the site because we read really deep and sophisticated works like ""The Iliad,"" and it would be really useful and helpful to use images, music, movie clips, and other supplements to aid in understanding the texts,"" Harris said.

378,Music Humanities,Getting home from Tomorrowland,4 October 2010,"BY GIA YANNEKIS AND JENNIFER FEARONWith Wall Street beckoning from just down the road and St Luke's calling out to the first-years in John Jay, many students seem to have forgotten that the various Cores, ""Hums,"" and Ways of Knowing are not simply graduation requirements designed to burden and limit students. While a prospective otolaryngologist should take biology and calculus, time for other interests should also be factored in—as every pre-professional advising office across the University recommends. Having a plan is certainly comforting, if only so that your mother knows that your human rights degree will amount to something. However, there is a delicate balance between having a plan and going overboard. Think back to your first year—how many kids on your hall were introduced as pre-med, pre-law, or pre-something? We can all agree that there are more than a few of this breed unless, of course, our floor was an exception. With the mindset that future successes are dependent upon an undergraduate career consisting of the perfect classes, perfect major, and perfect resume fodder, students can become fixated on their grand life plans even before they step on campus. There is no need to declare that you are a future otolaryngologist before your first college class. With the focus on pre-professional education quickly overtaking our desire to comprehend the Peloponnesian War and ""Civil Disobedience,"" we are losing sight of the core of Columbia's philosophy of multidisciplinary undergraduate education.Has the idea of a liberal arts education become so archaic that we should just skip to the next step? Columbians by and large say no. While the curriculum is constantly under revision, there aren't serious calls to throw it away and start anew. Yes, people seek to eliminate Music Humanities and restructure the Barnard science requirement, but when was the last time you heard real talk of nixing the entire Core? Additionally, the most famous journalism school in the country is nestled on College Walk, but none of the undergraduate schools boast journalism as a major. The closest most students will come to studying journalism is taking a class or two—a far cry from the rigorous training that is offered in communications programs across the globe. Why, may you ask, would Columbia not replicate such graduate programs on the undergraduate level? Over the course of our years here, we will all fulfill roughly a dozen distribution requirements envisioned as a means of expanding our perspectives through exposure to areas that would otherwise be overlooked. To actively promote pre-professionalism, the University would be going against the principles of education on which.all of the undergraduate schools were founded. At the end of the day, what the University mandates does not matter as much as what we, as students, can glean from these requirements. College is the time to experiment. Very few people, in their working lives, have time to take a course in Swahili just for fun. If we focus on looking forward, we will miss out on what is now. Find something that inspires you. Take a random course in Russian literature if you've ever had a fleeting interest in Dostoyevsky or a class on linear algebra if you really just love math. We're no authority, but we do practice what we preach. Gia is a probable biology major who professes to spend nearly every waking hour in the cinder block confines of Altschul. We don't really have any idea where Jen's headed. What we do know is that this semester we are taking sociology together—even though it's outside our academic focuses. Gia Yannekis is a Barnard College sophomore. Jennifer Fearon is a Barnard College sophomore majoring in political science and human rights. She is an associate editorial page editor.With the focus on preprofessional education, we are losing sight of the core of Columbia's philosophy of multidisciplinary undergraduate education."
379,Music Humanities,"True globalization, true diversity",29 October 2010,"BY WILLIAM THEODORE DE BARYEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome.There has been much ado about globalization recently at Columbia, much of it focused on the Global Centers—with new ones likely to open in Paris and Mumbai this spring. Fortunately it has been accompanied by attention also to strengthening the home base to provide for the educational resources needed to support these outreach activitiessome of it in major developments like the Manhattanville campus to provide for growing academic needs; others in seemingly modest ways like providing a center for graduate students where they can meet together to discuss their common needs, as recommended by the Student Affairs Committee of the University Senate. This latter need not be a big project, but it is symbolically important that graduate students should have even a small facility where, to balance the inherent specialization of graduate schools, their common interests and shared concerns can be given a voice on the main campus, so that diversity is grounded in and sustained by shared human values.This is not the first time Columbia has faced the challenge of globalization. When we were thrust unexpectedly and for the first time into World War I, Columbia College responded with a new program called War and Peace Issues that eventually became incorporated into the Contemporary Civilization course, required of all undergraduates as the first component of the new Core Curriculum. This was soon followed in the '3os by Literature, Art, and Music Humanities. External engagement evoked an internal response to meet the challenge. The next phase was World War 11, which led to the development of courses dealing with the Asian Classics and Civilization comparable to those in Literature Humanities and CC, which became part of the core requirements with limited options in the 'sos and '6os. The more recent to-do about globalization so far has been a response primarily to opportunities offered for study centers abroad that focus on mini-campuses in major cities already heavily engaged in the world market economy. It seems a natural response to economic globalization, but the extent to which the new centers have robust links to the University's academic base is unclear. Dual-degree programs have been vetted by the University Senate's Executive Committee and approved by the Senate as a whole. They were treated as routine graduate programs that did not need to be discussed as part of a balanced university education. Study abroad, however, does not satisfy the need for a globalcore, and is no substitute for it. It is fine for summer adventuring but cannot fulfill the purposes of a core curriculum. Meanwhile, the global component of the Core Curriculum has not enjoyed a similar strengthening or enhancement. On the contrary, the present Global Core requirement has undergone such diversification as to erode any concept of core at all. Instead of focusing on shared human concerns across cultures, the distribution has featured diversity in the form of departmentalization or the substitution of different disciplinary approaches to learning. This diversification can of course accommodate itself easily to the variety of opportunities presented abroad, but it is not balanced by attention to the shared human values that should guide the process of globalization. This atrophy of the Core concept is accompanied today by an exclusive emphasis on diversity, as if the latter could stand on its own without consensual agreement on the shared human values that should underlie and nourish respect for diversity. Recently, major appointments to the central administration have been hailed as advancing diversity as a self-sufficient value, and questions as to the educational philosophy that should inform and support diversity go unanswered. As a result, Columbia has tended to lose the distinct educational character that formerly was identified with the College's Core Curriculum and which has so far been the strongest factor in student, faculty andespecially alumni support of the College. Now as we embark on new ""global"" enterprises, the University's increasing costs are being sustained by expanding college enrollment In the past when this had been attempted, the move to increase college tuition income was ostensibly accompanied by supposed enhancements to the College program, but anyone familiar with that program knows that these claimed ""enhancements"" have proven illusory. Any new moves to increase college enrollment should reckon with the danger they could represent to the dilution of the Core and its distinctive small-class, discussionmethod of instruction (in contrast to the large lecture classes exhibiting ""famous"" faculty ""performers"" common to other universities). The weakness of the Global Core and the decay of our commitment to the fundamental concepts of the Core are at the heart of the true question of how to deal with ""globalization."" It is what should be in the forefront of discussion by all segments of the Universitystudent, faculty, alumni—as well as bodies like the University Senate and the central administration.

380,Music Humanities,Music prof remembered as inspirational conductor,11 February 2011,"BY SONALEE RAU Spectator Senior Staff WriterThe people close to conductor and Music Humanities professor Johannes Somary said they will continue to hear his music long after his passing. Somary died at his home in the Bronx on Feb. 1 at the age of 75. Susan Boynton, chair of the music department, was one of Somary's students at the Horace Mann School in New York where he taught Advanced Placement Music Theory for over 40 years and helped him get a job at her department in 2009. ""I'm the chair of Music Hum, so I read all the course evaluations, and the students just loved him, raved about him,"" Boynton said, adding that many wrote that ""he was the best professor they'd encountered at Columbia."" Somary's students at Columbia said his enthusiasm and vivacity were unparalleled. ""He walked up to every Music Humanities class on the 7th floor of Hamilton. We [the students] would come in panting or would take the elevator, but he was always so composed,"" Emily Steinberger, CC 'lO, said. ""He loved life and tried to transmit his joie de vivre to his students."" After Somary suffered a stroke last December, his family set up a Caringßridge website for friends to send him good wishes. Today, the website has over 30,000 hits on it from friends, musicians that he taught or performed with around the world, and students, according to his son Stephen Somary. ""This overwhelming outpouring of emotion for this man, the scope of how many people he touched ... it was quite overwhelming,"" Stephen said. Boynton described attending a rehearsal last November for aconcert conducted by Somary—it included one of her favorite compositions, Carissimi's oratorio, Jepthe, to which Somary introduced her when she was his student. ""Hearing him rehearse was like old times. What I saw in his conducting in November was no different from what I had seen in his conducting 30 years ago,"" Boynton said. Boynton said the piece still connects her to Somary. ""I now teach it to my students at Columbia. The way I teach is in some way inspired by his teaching,"" she said. Stephen said he grew up on his father's music, attending concerts with him from a very young age. He said he will always remember ""feeling the intensity of the music that he made, and the intensity of the audience just... enraptured, and the explosions of applause at the end."" Although Somary, the founder and artistic director of Amor Artis, an all-professional chorale with orchestral accompaniment, was interested in music that spanned genres and periods, ""the work most dear to his heart was by Franz Joseph Haydn, a large choral oratorio called 'The Creation,""' Stephen said. ""That was the seminal work for him ... [upon] which he really based his spirituality. It's the story of the creation of the world and the very beginning of Genesis."" Stephen added that his father greatly valued the last two years of his life spent teaching at Columbia. ""His last years at Columbia were very meaningful for him,"" Stephen said. ""He was a great father to my brother and sister and I, but... he was really a father figure for hundreds and hundreds of people."" sonalee.rau @columbiaspectator.com"
381,Music Humanities,Reharmonizing Japan,25 March 2011,"BY YOSHIAKI ONISHIBeethoven's music is an integral part of the core repertories for instructors who teach in Music Humanities courses here at Columbia. When I teach the music of Beethoven written toward the end of his life, after my colleague's recommendation, I assign a few extra readings to students. One of them is written by Theodor W. Adorno, entitled ""Beethoven's Late Style,"" written in 1934. It brings readers to think more critically about Beethoven's late works that are often characterized by the audible sense of fragmentation, dislocation, and seemingly intentional disregard of roles of convention—all of which Adorno refers to as ""catastrophes."" When I explained to the class that Adorno did not mean ""catastrophes"" as a pejorative term to describe Beethoven's music but instead meant it as an intentional artistic ""design"" on Beethoven's part, I had to stop for a moment. The word immediately made me think of the images of the disaster that struck the Northeast region of Japan on March 11. We have witnessed the catastrophes. We have been affected—whether directly, indirectly, or psychologically—by the monstrosity of the disaster and the imagery of what we were left with after the tsunami swept away the region.Thus the word catastrophe takes on a new meaning, at least for me—something that is psychologically threatening, a sort of a crisis accompanied by a sense of helplessness. My spring break was spent in front of the TV, watching the NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) news. Without fully recovering from the distressed state I was in during the spring break, I taught Beethoven alongside the Adorno reading today. I held those two words, ""catastrophes"" and ""crisis,"" as key points. All of a sudden, Beethoven's late works and the current state of Japan, seemingly completely unrelated, started to connect in my mind. Because these two pieces are in the Adorno article, I played the fifth movement of the Beethoven's 14th string quartet, Op. 131. It is a very peculiar movement. Musical gestures are fragmented by frequent insertions of pauses. The music keeps stopping. Then I played his Bagatelle, Op. 126-6, in which he presents a virtuosic piano flourish at the beginning. Then he ignores it for four minutes, but at the end—almost unexpectedly—the flourish returns. It is an audible representation of displacement. What's going on here? Beethoven embeds questions in his late works. The music asks us listeners, ""What if the music is filled with so many pauses? How would that affect the way we hear the music? How are the flourishes at the beginning and at the end perceived?"" In a way, the music tells us that its life goes on even after the death of its creator becauseEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome.these questions trigger people to think and spark dialogues. In that sense, Beethoven's works give threads of hope—that the crisis is not the end and that the catastrophe is not the representation of the end. By way of dialectical turns, the crisis becomes the new beginning, and the catastrophes gives birth to it. The disaster in Japan leaves us speechless. But it is an opportunity for recovery. The citizens' diligent efforts, notably the ""Fukushima 50,"" are exemplary, as seen on various media. It is a new beginning, hopefully a start of something better than ever before. In his own lifetime, Beethoven too had some major crises. We know of, for example, his deafness, some difficulties with his nephew, Karl, and the much debated and even romanticized aspect of his relationship with his ""immortal beloved."" However, even during his life's difficulties, he overcame his challenges and achieved his profound late style. Composing was his sole way to express himself outwardly. And most importantly, throughout his life, he continued to search his next step. He had to go onward. We too must go onward. This is one of the greatest lessons about a way of life that everybody can take.

383,Music Humanities,Struggles to find Core teachers continue Declining percentages of tenured professors mean more adjuncts,14 October 2011,"Declining percentages of tenured professors mean more adjunctsBY SAMMY ROTH Spectator Senior Staff WriterMore than a third of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations classes were taught by graduate students last year, and more than 15 percent were taught by adjunct professors, while a quarter of Lit Hum and CC sections were taught by tenured or tenure-track professors. The Core has been the centerpiece of undergraduate education at Columbia for more than 90 years, but for administrators and department chairs, finding people to teach it is a constant struggle. The number of tenured and tenure-track professors teaching in the Core has been steadily declining, creating a need for more adjunct professors, postdoctoral students, and graduate students, and it's sometimes difficult just to find a teacher for every Core section. ""We worry about Core teaching every year. It hasn't changed,"" Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks said. ""Some years we do better than other years. But I mean, it's been a regular worry."" Philosophy professor Michele Moody-Adams raised concerns about the health of the Core Curriculum when she resigned as dean of Columbia College this summer. In her resignation letter to alumni, Moody-Adams cited impending structural changes to the University that would ""ultimately compromise the College's academic quality and financial health."" But administrators saythere is no reason for students to worry about either the College or the Core. And Dirks told Spectator that the Core Curriculum was not discussed in McKinsey & Company's recent report on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a report some have speculated prompted Moody-Adams to resign. Philosophy professor Christia Mercer, the chair of Literature Humanities, said that there are ways to strengthen the Core, but that its problems aren't new. ""I am not concerned any more than I was six months ago,"" she said. 'ANY INCREASE WOULD BE WELCOME' Some departments, like history and English, contribute disproportionately to the teaching of the Core, but other departments keep their distance. Dirks said that he works with departments to set quotas for Core teaching, but those quotas aren't always met. Departments are also tasked with staffing their own undergraduate courses and graduate level courses, and sometimes there aren't enough professors to go around. Of the nine tenured or ten-ure-track professors in the Slavic languages and literatures department, seven regularly teach in the Core Curriculum. But when it comes to staffing the Core Curriculum, the Slavic department is more the exception than the rule. Department Chair Alan Timberlake said that his professors really enjoy the contentof the Core. But that's not the only reason they teach it, he said. ""It seems like a natural place to participate in the University, to have a place in the University life,"" he said. Of the 22 tenured or tenuretrack professors in the anthropology department, for instance, only one is teaching a Core class this semester, save for courses that count towards the Global Core requirement. ""We've made deals with departments at different times, and we've sought to get the departments to ante up to the agreements stipulated,"" Dirks said. ""But it doesn't always work, and then we have to hire adjuncts or others to teach in the Core."" Dirks, an anthropology professor, said that in the 1993-94 academic year, 17 percent of Lit Hum and CC sections were taught by tenured professors, compared to 15 percent last year. But in the long term, tenured and tenure-track professors are teaching in the Core less frequently. East Asian Studies professor and former provost William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, MA '4B, PhD '53, who has taught at Columbia since 1949, said that the proportion of Core sections taught by tenured and tenure-track professors used to be ""much larger."" ""Any increase would be welcome,"" de Bary said. Dirks added that in the 199192 academic year, there were 195 Lit Hum and CC sections, compared to 242 last year, which has made it even more difficult to keep the Core staffed by regular faculty members. ""The faculty is stretched really pretty thin, and we have to treat the Core as a priority, but that nevertheless has to be thought of in relationship to all the other things the departments have to mount,"" he said. Lit Hum and CC in particular have been impacted by those trends, particularly in light of increases in the Columbia College student body without a corresponding increase in the size of the departments that tend to staff these classes. Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that there is a ""downward trajectory of percentages"" when it comes to tenured and tenure-track professors teaching these classes. ""I'm optimistic that now that it's on people's agendas, we can focus some of our work in this area,"" Yatrakis said. PERSUASION AND CAJOLING But hiring more faculty members to teach the Core might not be enough. Even if departments had enough professors to teach the Core and all their specialized classes, administrators and department chairs would still have to convince individual professors to teach. And for some professors, the Core just isn't a priority. ""Even chairs have a great deal of difficulty telling their faculty what to teach,"" Dirks said. ""They have to persuade them, they have to cajole them."" Many professors would prefer to teach their specialties, and young tenure-track professors especially are driven by the need to do research and publish. ""If you haven't published, you have a hard time getting a job at all,"" de Bary said. ""And you're not going to get published unless you have something special to offer the publisher."" Senior professors, too, are pulled in many directions. ""A senior professor has a lot of different obligations, and it's hard to juggle those,"" Mercer said. Meanwhile, teaching in the Core takes a lot of work—especially Lit Hum and CC, which meet almost four hours per week, involve heavy reading loads and require professors to grade essays without the help of teaching assistants. And in general, teaching in the Core forces faculty members to teach outside their specialties, something which, as Director of the Center for the Core Curriculum Roosevelt Montas, CC '95, M.A. '96, Ph.D 'O4, put it, ""no professor does willingly."" ""The incentives of the profession pull against teaching in the Core,"" Montas said.ADJUNCTS AND POSTDOCS Lit Hum and CC classes that aren't taught by professors, associate professors or assistant professors—all of whom are tenured or tenure-track—are taught by a combination of grad students, postdocs, adjunct professors, a few retired professors like de Bary and several one-year departmental appointees known as lecturers. History professor Matthew Jones, the chair of Contemporary Civilization, said that ""we want as few adjunct professors teaching in the Core as we can."" But he added that some postdocs, who are often hired as adjuncts at Columbia on their way to tenure-track jobs elsewhere, are ""exactly the sort of professors that you as students want.""Similarly, many University Writing classes are taught by adjunct professors and parttime hires, according to English professor Nicole Wallack, the director of the Undergraduate Writing Center. Music professor Elaine Sisman, the chair of Music Humanities, said that some full professors continue to teach Music Hum, but that many sections are taught by pcfttdocs. ""It both cushions them between graduate school and the job market and keeps excellent teachers in the Core,"" Sisman said. Biology professor Darcy Kelley, a co-chair of Frontiers of Science, said that the bulk of the weekly seminars in Frontiers, too, are taught by postdoc research fellows. Most of these fellows teach two seminars per semester—which, Kelley noted, Columbia College defines as a full teaching load—while still doing research to ensure that they can get jobs after their fellowships end. Additionally, a few years ago Dirks started the Core Assistant Professorships program, an initiative to hire postdocs who already taught Core classes while graduate students at Columbia. Dirks said that CAPs are currently funded out of the Arts and Sciences budget, although A&S is working to raise funds to support them. University Trustees Jonathan Lavine, CC 'BB, and Gerry Lenfest, Law '5B, each recently pledged $2.5 million to match gifts that endow CAPs. 'BURSTING AT THE SEAMS' Finding more tenured and tenure-track faculty to teach in the Core is one thing, but just finding someone to cover each section is a challenge on its own. There are some systematic staffing problems in the Core—every year, teachers drop out of classes at the last minute or decide to go on leave, and the number of students from the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of General Studies enrolled in Core cjasses changes from year to year. In the last few years, though, there have been fewer grad students applying to teach in the Core, too. ""We are expecting and have been getting big drops in graduate students,"" Montas said. There are a few reasons for this drop-off. For one, GSAS deliberately decreased its class size by 10 percent three years ago, a change that Montas said is just starting to hit the Core. Another complication is that three years ago, the grad school decided to more strictly enforceits policy that students cannot receive funding past their seventh year of study, GSAS Dean Carlos Alonso said. Grad students had frequently applied for a two-year Core preceptor position in their seventh year, and GSAS had previously made an exception and and funded eighth-year students teaching in the Core. Alonso attributed the decrease in grad students applying to teach in the Core to ""the onerous nature of the commitment to teach in the Core,"" but added that he has lobbied Columbia College to accept Core preceptors for just one year. Yatrakis, though, said GSAS students were never actually required to make a two-year commitment to the Core—rather, the Core was committed to keeping the graduate students it hired for two years if they wanted to teach a second year. She said she hopes that once this confusion is cleared up more grad students will teach in the Core during their seventh years only. ""Those who teach in the seventh year and complete their dissertation, now have an incentive to also apply to be a Core Assistant Professor,"" Yatrakis said. But when it comes to staffing, sometimes the ends still don't meet. In University Writing this semester, a perfect storm of professors dropping out at the last minute and an increased number of SEAS students, combined with a pre-planned ""tight"" enrollment of classes, left UWriting without enough instructors, Wallack said. Since all Columbia College first-years must take UWriting one semester and Frontiers of Science during the other, Frontiers is overenrolled this Semester. Kelley described the course as ""bursting at the seams somewhat."" ""You need more faculty to teach it,"" she said. ""And the teachers are the most expensive part of the Core."" 'THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN THEIR MISSION' Paying for teachers is expensive generally, but paying for Core teachers is even more so, as Columbia provides several financial incentives for faculty who teach in the Core. Currently, the Chamberlain Fellowship provides tenuretrack junior faculty with one semester off at full pay if they teach six semesters of the Core. And senior faculty are rewarded with a summer stipend of $7,000 after teaching four sections of the Core, although they can only get this stipend once every four years. Mercer said that to make the Core ""as great as it can be,"" incentives need to be increased. She suggested that the first time a professor teaches in the Core, there should be a $5,000-$6,000 bonus, followed by $2,000$3,000 rewards for each additional Core section taught. ""We need to put our money where our mouth is,"" she said. It's unclear if and when incentives will increase, but Yatrakis and Dirks said they are working to raise money to expand those programs. Dirks noted that he is fundraising for the Chamberlain endowment fund, and Yatrakis said she would like to raise the summer stipend for senior faculty to SIO,OOO. But Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini said that he has been talking to professors about how they decide what classes to teach, and he hasn't yet decided if increasing monetary incentives will do the trick. ""It's a general consideration of a structure which involves rewards, inducements, incentives, whatever, to satisfy all of the objectives,"" Valentini said. ""Of which the Core is one, but not the only one we have."" De Bary said that while greater monetary incentives would certainly help convince more senior faculty members to teach in the Core, the biggest roadblock is not financial. ""The principle strength of the Core in the past was the sense of collegiality among those who were teaching it. They really believed in their mission. That's more important than anything else,"" de Bary said. ""Trouble is that that mission does not count very heavily in appointment and tenure promotion."" sammy.roth @columbiaspectator.com""We've sought to get the departments to ante up to the agreements stipulated. But it doesn't always work, and then we have to hire adjuncts or others to teach in the Core."" —Nicholas Dirks, Executive Vice President of Arts and SciencesCORE OF THE CORE Mark Lilla, a tenured professor of humanities and religion, teaches a section of Literature Humanities."
384,Music Humanities,STAFF EDITORIAL Diversity University,4 November 2011,"Diversity UniversityOfficials at Columbia—especially our admissions officers—affirm that we are a diverse institution. Our students hail from different countries and states, belong to various ethnic and racial groups, and bring personal experiences to Columbia that make our university unique. While we may excel in measuring up to certain definitions of diversity, we fall seriously short in others. Though you may have a world-class pianist, a published author, and a nationally ranked tennis player in your Music Humanities class, you are less likely to find an equally dazzling array of socioeconomic diversity among your peers. The notion that our university may not be as diverse as we think is difficult to reconcile with our understanding of Columbia and our peers. But it is a reality that we, as students, and the administration must address. Columbia's admissions process centers on bringing racial and ethnic diversity to campus, which hasundoubtedly made our campus a more enriching place. But by focusing primarily on ethnic rather than socioeconomic diversity, Columbia's admissions process overlooks students who have dissimilar backgrounds and life experiences. While Columbia has ""need-blind"" admissions, the category is not as neatly defined as it may seem. The types of activities and statistics that the admissions officers look for are often class-limited. SAT preparation, fencing lessons, and extracurricular activities are sometimes available only to students who can afford them or to students who are lucky enough to attend elite high schools. How can Columbia truly be need-blind if the prerequisites for admission require students to be from a certain socioeconomic class or within range of a prestigious school? Not to mention, other indicators of socioeconomic status—parents' occupations and home addresses—are components of the application as well. Instead of attempting to be needblind, the University should openly weigh the merits of pursuing affirmative action based on socioeconomic status rather than that based on race. Once students arrive on campus, we often channel our racial and experience-based diversity into specific groups. A plethora of different cultural, religious, and political groups help to uphold and reinforce the diversitywe do have at Columbia. Without these groups, the minority presence on campus would lack the voice and immediacy that it has. While cultural groups are sometimes denounced as cliquey and exclusive, it's important not to overlook what they bring to the table—a deeper appreciation and understanding of their cultures. However, students shouldn't let the laudable goal of understanding their own heritage blind them to the importance of reaching beyond the confines of their own experience. Crossing boundaries should be encouraged—white students should feel comfortable attending meetings held by the Black Students Organization, students from Lucha should attend events held by the Asian American Alliance, etc. By upholding our own backgrounds as well as learning about others', we can achieve a more holistic sense of diversity than the one we currently have. In the meantime, the University should be considering and discussing policy changes that will bring more socioeconomic diversity to Columbia. While it's important to appreciate the richness that students from different ethnic backgrounds bring to campus, we should not rest on the laurels of a racially diverse student body. Instead, Columbia should focus on achieving new and equally important types of diversity."
385,Music Humanities,Best of 18+ show spaces,2 December 2011,"One of the greatest advantages of living in New York is that live music is always playing somewhere. The Lower East Side's live music scene dates back to the 1960s counterculture movements. It was then cemented by punk and post-punk of the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. The number of music venues has seemingly exploded over the last decade as gentrification has made the neighborhood safer. Brooklyn followed suit starting in the early 2000s, with rapid development in Williamsburg in particular. New York is arguably nothing without its rich music scenes, and some concert spaces have taken that sentiment to heart, opening their doors to all ages, and after the legendary rock club CBGB closed, these 18+ and all-age venues are needed more than ever. —BY ANATOLE ASHRAFSmalls Columbia students are exposed to jazz, a quintessential American art form, in Music Humanities. There are few better ways to appreciate it than in New York's premier jazz club, Smalls (183 W. 10th St., at Seventh Avenue). Established in 1993, the venue has attracted masters such as Frank Hewitt, Tommy Turrentine, and singer Marion Cowings, who formerly taught Harry Connick Jr. and now hosts a vocal class on Sundays at 1 p.m. Smalls also enjoys a reputation as the preferred late-night hangout for jazz greats and professionals. Although the club charges a $2O cover, the cost allows attendees to freely enter and exit the space all evening ($lO after-hours, around 10 p.m.). Under-21 fans are welcome to join the proceedings, such as the thrilling Sunday night jam sessions.Arlene's Grocery Arlene's Grocery (95 Stanton St., between Orchard and Ludlow streets) is a veritable institution in the Lower East Side. A converted grocery store, the venue has drawn some of the best local and national bands since 1995. The Strokes had a residency here back in 2000, which was then taken over by The Bravery. Most shows are 18+, and the cover is usually $lO, if not free. Furthermore, hanging out on the ramp outside can lead to some fantastic NYC memories.The Knitting Factory Sometimes the victims of gentrification in the city aren't residents but resident music venues. The Knitting Factory (361 Metropolitan Ave., at Havemeyer Street) is one such victim, having been priced out of the West Village a few years ago. Thankfully, the 18+ venue relocated to Brooklyn recently, taking advantage of the cheaper rent with a bigger space that somehow feels more intimate with its warm decor than its West Village incarnation. The sound system has also been greatly improved, perfect for enjoying the fantastic local and smaller national acts regularly featured at the venue.Pete's Candy Store Williamsburg has no shortage of music venues. Noteworthy 18+ venues, however, are few and far between. Pete's Candy Store (709 Lorimer St., between Richardson and Frost streets) is a welcome addition to the area. First off, the food is fantastic. The roasted turkey, white cheddar, and spicy aioli sandwich is a required experience at the club. The artists, on the other hand, are eclectic, fresh, and are all radio-worthy. The venue also hosts various events that are lots of fun. Bring friends and compete in the Wednesday night Quiz-Off for a $75 bar tab (good for virgin drinks, too, but be sure to tip)."
386,Music Humanities,Frontiers of the mind,9 December 2011,"BY DAVID KAGAN""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts,"" said Richard Feynman in his speech, ""What is Science?"" What did Feynman, a pioneer of quantum theory and surely an expert in his own right, mean by this provocative definition? A superficial reading might suggest a form of radical skepticism—reasoning that may well lead one to believe nobody, perhaps not even oneself. But such a dictum is an absurd one to live by, let alone to ground science on. No, Feynman was not advocating a path to nihilism. Rather, he advocated a pragmatic skepticism of authority; a realization that it is not impolite to ask for evidence and to try to understand things on your own terms, even if the person telling you what to believe is Quite The Expert. In my last Frontiers of Science seminar, a student shrewdly pointed out that the word ""science"" in Feynman's statement seemed like it could be replaced by almost any critical endeavor. After all, impressionists challenged the Academie de Beaux-Arts experts' sense of aesthetic, expanding the Western notion of art. Shakespeare, needing a word, wasn't hampered by the vocabulary of his day; he made up new ones, and in doing so, powerfully expanded the English language's range of prosaic and poetic expression. Feynman's dictum, suitably generalized, gets at the core of the liberal arts' mission: to educate a citizenry that can participate fully in the intellectual and civic life of the nation and the world. I enjoy thinking of my first days as a Columbia student, stepping into my first Core class (Music Humanities). In that class and others I was enriched by a broad crosssection of world knowledge, thought, and culture. More significant was my exposure to methods of thinking about, parsing, and interpreting a book, a symphony, a philosophy. This was not something that instructors discussed explicitly. These modes of thought seeped in through reading, essay writing, and most importantly, the give-and-take of seminar discussion.One thing troubled me: We laud Shakespeare's plays as great art, but why isn't Newton's thought accorded a similar respect for its creativity? Science and art clearly differ—science requires the possibility of disproof, even of cherished ideas—but it seemed to me that the wall separating how we present these two strands of thought was too impermeable. At Columbia, we had the Core and we had science requirements, but at the time we had no Core course that exposed the student community to varieties of scientific topics, highlighting their role in the huijftan endeavor to understand the world and ourselves. This void was to the detriment of the arts and the sciences, for they are not created in separate worlds. They influence each other, and our understanding of either is impoverished when we lack either perspective. I graduated and went on to get a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Cambridge. Imagine my surprise on finding out that Columbia had instituted a science-based Core course in the meantime! Fortunately, I had the opportunity to return to Columbia, this time as a faculty member charged with leading seminars in the new course. Frontiers of Science is probably more intimidating to the beginning instructor than to the first-year student. In many ways, I was a scientific ignoramus—l knew a lot of physics, but miniscule amounts of biology, chemistry, neuroscience, or pretty much any other science. Yet I have to guide activities and discussion, highlighting the insights at the cutting edge of various sciences. The fact that I can even teach the course is a testament to its notion that having ""scientific habits of mind"" is sufficient, not to master these subjects, but to look at data, understand arguments, and even constructively critique the lectures given by the experts. Frontiers introduces students to scientific ways of thinking about the world. Taken together with the humanities, these modes of thought allow us to apply Feynman's dictum to its most important subject—ourselves. The little expert in one's head is hard to argue with, but with the methods of artistic and scientific thought embodied in Columbia's Core, one can begin to constructively appreciate one's own ignorance, and perceive with greater clarity the awesome mysteries at the heart of our existence. The author is a postdoctoral researcher at the physics department's Institute for Strings, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics.

387,Music Humanities,Admins hope to endow Core Campaign still in early planning stages,10 February 2012,"Campaign still in early planning stagesBY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterSenior administrators are planning to establish an endowment for the Core Curriculum to help ensure its long-term sustainability. Alumni, faculty members, and administrators have been discussing ideas for a broadbased fundraising initiative since the fall. University President Lee Bollinger said that the plan for the endowment is still being pieced together, but that by the end of the semester it should be ""pretty well shaped-up."" ""I think that there will be a lot of people who will find this appealing to support,"" he said. ""We're bringing the college, the faculty, and the curriculum much closer together, so that's kind of the goal. The more that happens, the more people will want to give-both for what they've been giving and more broadly."" As Columbia's capital campaign has surged past its initial goal of $4 billion and toward its new goal of $5 billion, Bollinger said he is hopeful that a ""sub-campaign"" could be established in support ofundergraduate education. ""I think that there is no question that we will have a campaign to get a greater endowment for the Core,"" he said. ""And I think we will expand that and include it as part of a campaign for all undergraduate teaching and faculty departments as well."" Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks said that the Core endowment would be a ""wonderful opportunity"" to solidify support for the curriculum, especially considering the unique logistical demands of the Core and the outsize share of Columbia College students' educations that it takes up. ""We're always interested in finding greater levels of support for the Core because it's a very time-intensive mode of education,"" he said. ""We're all keen to find ways to support what is an extraordinarily complicated and difficult curriculum to mount."" The Core requires the staffing of many small sections each year, making it an expensive program. Finding enough professors and graduate students to teach every semester can be a challenge, and some have said there should be more financial incentives for tenured and ten-ure-track faculty to teach Core classes. Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini is one of several administrators who have been involved in discussions about a Core endowment. He said that although no decisions have been made about how an endowment would be allocated, some of it could go toward incentivizing senior faculty members to teach courses like LiteratureHumanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""Endow means enhance, in this case,"" Valentini said. ""If something is important to you, you want to establish a base of funding that guarantees its existence in perpetuity.""Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis added that, ""since the Core is the intellectual and curricular signature of the College, one of the first issues we will want to address is the normative one ... what should be the percentage of tenure and ten-ure-track faculty teaching in the Core."" Valentini explained that he is working with other administrators to develop a detailed plan for a Core endowment that would outline its goals and explore ways of achieving them. He has also spent time talking to alumni about what a Core endowment would look like. ""Endowing the Core is both establishing money for it and also getting money to make it better,"" he said. ""If something is a priority to you, you find a special line of funding for it.""Dirks agreed that it is important to encourage senior faculty to participate in the Core. ""We want to make sure that we get more and more senior faculty teaching in the Core,"" Dirks said. ""It also makes clear the commitment of the institution as a whole to the importance of the Core."" Dirks, who is teaching a section of Contemporary Civilization for the first time this semester, also expressed interest in establishing more support for Art Humanities and Music Humanities. ""I would like very much to include them, eventually in the ideas of endowing the Core,"" he said. ""The only way to really keep them going and ensure that they keep going is to get an endowment for that as well."" As administrators work to transition the Core endowment from an idea to a formal initiative, they have been'talking to many alumni, including representatives from the Columbia College Board of Visitors. ""We are working with alumni ... to ensure that it [the Core] gets more support even now, but also for future generations so that it doesn't get cut for. the wrong reasons,"" Dirks said. 'The endowment is still in its preliminary planning stages, but Valentini said that he is looking to broaden the discussion.

388,Music Humanities,Classical Performers team up with Harvard,23 February 2012,"BY EMILY OSTERTAG Spectator Staff WriterColumbia Classical Performers is hoping to up the ante with its latest collaboration with Harvard. On Saturday, Feb. 25, Columbia Classical Performers will continue its five-year-old partnership with Harvard's Brattle Street Players in a collaborative concert at the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus on West 96th Street, at 8 p.m. The concert will feature Tchaikovsky's ""Serenade for Strings,"" Mozart's ""Divertimento K. 136,"" Ravel's ""Tombeau de Couperin,"" Mendelssohn's ""Octet for Strings,"" Brahms' ""Sextet for Strings,"" and Gaubert's ""Soir d'Automne"" from his ""Trois Aquarelles."" Columbia Classical Performers was founded in 2001 as a group dedicated to giving classical musicians on campus opportunities to perform in front of their peers in stress-free environments. This year, said CCP president Caroline Sonnett, the group is focusing on carrying out that mission by expanding its recital program with four recitals this semester and five recitals last semester. All of the recitals are open to the campus community and are available for anyonewho wants to sign up to perform. The collaboration with Harvard's group also includes fourbythree, a selective, studentrun chamber group at Columbia similar to the Brattle Street Players. Since the partnership began, the groups have alternated the locations of their yearly joint concerts between Boston and New York. The groups only began preparing the repertoire for this concert a month ago and the rest of the semester will be busy for CCP as well. In addition to the upcoming recitals, the group will also be organizing the second annual Music Hum in a Day concert on March 27, a marathon performance of some of the highlights covered on the Music Humanities syllabus, as well as the first Columbia Composers concert, a performance of works by student and faculty composers at Columbia. Sonnett is particularly excited about the inclusion of Ravel's ""Tombeau de Couperin"" in the Brattle Street collaboration concert. ""It's not a standard chamber piece because it was first written for piano, then for orchestra, and then for quintet,"" she said. ""It's interesting to look at the quintet and see what remained from the original version."" arts@columbiaspectator.comTUNING UP I CU Classical Performers will play this weekend with Harvard's Brattle Street Players."
389,Music Humanities,Classical performers bring syllabus to life,3 April 2012,"BY EMILY OSTERTAG Spectator Staff WriterOne of Columbia's greatest sources of pride is its Core Curriculum. Yet, ask any student what purpose a class like Music Humanities serves, and you are quite likely to get an eye roll and an answer along the lines of, ""It prepares us for cocktail parties later in life."" One Columbia student group, however, is out to prove why those who see classical music as only interesting to stuffy octogenarians could not be more wrong. Last Tuesday, Columbia Classical Performers provided what was most likely the most enjoyable Music Hum study session any audience member had ever been to at its second annual ""Music Humanities in a Day"" concert. The concert featured some of the most canonical works of classical music, performed by Columbia undergraduates. Though most Music Hum classes differ slighdy from one another in that each class varies which works are studied, the performance covered many of the most commonly-studied pieces from the Renaissance to the 20th century, including Monteverdi's ""L'Orfeo,"" Bach's ""Art of the Fugue,"" and Schoenberg's ""Pierrot Lunaire."" ""The idea originally came from wanting to bring not only music, but also Columbia musicians to the general campus,"" Victoria Lewis, CC 'l3, a violinist and the event's primary organizer, said. Although theconcert would have been a helpful overview for anyone taking a Music Hum exam anytime soon, Lewis said that having a ""review session"" was only half of the concert's purpose, especially since most Music Hum classes have already had their midterms. For CCP, the purpose of Music Humanities is being able to analyze works within the larger context of music history. ""We also wanted to show that Music Hum can be enjoyable and that classical music doesn't only come out of a CD player,"" added Lewis. ""We were also able to show such a huge array of instrumental and vocal arrangements that wouldn't even fit in a classroom, so it was a much larger array and variety for people to see."" CCP also provided concert programs with extensive program notes written by the performers, which showed not only the group's ability to put together such an ambitious program, but also its members' extensive collective knowledge about the works and composers themselves. Lewis said that CCP wants to collaborate more with the Music Department to make it even more in line with the class's curriculum. ""I do think it's a rite of passage to complain about the Core,"" Lewis said. ""But I do think that people came out of this concert realizing that classical music is alive, and how much the young student body cares about it."" arts@columbiaspectator.comMAKING MUSIC 1 The Columbia Classical Performers bring humanity back to Music Humanities."
390,Music Humanities,"CU, Ursinus College to compare core classes Mellon Foundation funds joint study of schools' core curricula",25 September 2012,"Mellon Foundation funds joint study of schools' core curriculaBY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterColumbia and Ursinus College are teaming up to study and improve their core curricula, powered by a $300,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Ursinus, a liberal arts college in a Philadelphia suburb with an enrollment of about 1,700 students, created its main core course in 2002, more than 80 years after Columbia instructors taught the first Contemporary Civilization classes. Now, the two schools will collaborate, with the Mellon Foundation grant funding visits from Ursinus professors and students to Columbia, and vice versa. Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said in an email that Ursinus used ""the Columbia College model"" to develop its main core course, a yearlong class called the Common Intellectual Experience. The CIE syllabus includes a combination of texts that are taught in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""We are extremely pleased with this opportunity to formalize those earlier links by sharing institutional knowledge about the challenges and opportunities of running a successful Core program,"" Yatrakis said. While Ursinus doesn'tmandate any other classes for all students, like Art Humanities and Music Humanities at Columbia, it requires that students fulfill distribution requirements across disciplines ranging from music to mathematics, in addition to completing the CIE.The Mellon Foundation funding will support ""visits from Columbia scholars whose expertise pertains to works in the CIE syllabus,"" as well as visits to Columbia from Ursinus Junior Fellows and select first-year students, according to an Ursinus statement. Additionally, an Ursinus professor will teach a Core class at Columbia. Roosevelt Montas, the director of Columbia's Center for the Core Curriculum, said that the partnership would help Ursinus troubleshoot as it continues to develop its core, and that Columbia graduate students would be able to takesummer workshops at Ursinus that would introduce them to a ""liberal arts pedagogy."" ""The main benefit to Columbia from this collaboration comes in the opportunities it will create for our graduate students to learn about teaching in a liberal arts college,"" Montas said, adding that some of the grant money will be used to create post-doc-toral positions for Columbia doctoral students who teach in the Core. The Mellon Foundation funding will also fund the establishment of post-doctoralfellows at Ursinus, as well as the creation of the MellonCIE Junior Fellows program, which is being modeled after Columbia's Core Scholars program. Classics professor Gareth Williams, who is currently chair of Literature Humanities, said that he hoped that the new partnership would generate more interest in teaching in the Core among Columbia faculty members.

Spectator Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer A Though everyone in Columbia College is subject to the joys and struggles of the Core \ Curriculum, some felt their experience with the Core seeps into their creative life. Five CC students were recently recognized as Core Scholars for artistic endeavors—whether music, visual arts, or Writing—inspired by Core works. Alessio Mineo, CC ’l4, is well-known on campus for his performances in the 118th Varsity Show and the Columbia Musical Theatre Society’s fall production of “Hair.” Offstage, ._ though, he writes, and his poem “zwischen Sein und” was selected as one of the five winning Core Scholar submissions. v “The poem is a little bit about me and my feelings or things that I think about——vignettes from my mind—but it’s also about text as having its own identity,” he said. “And, in the way that I have my family and ancestors and teach- ‘ ers who have taught me how to read and write, the text also is part of a tradition, a large tradition, which is how the poem kind of connected to the Core.” V , ‘ "" A Mineo was inspired by Dido’s suicide in “The Aeneid.” ” “It also comes from a consideration of Dido’s suicide as something that pops up in ‘Confessions’ and Purcell’s ‘Dido and Aeneas,’ the opera you listen to in Music Humanities,” he said. “It seemed to be this thing that kind of followed me around.” A neuroscience major, Allison Scott, CC ’l5, . has been impacted byvthe Core not only in her I artwork—drawing and watercolor—but also inof Columbia academics. agreat Way to interact with everyone in because at a lot of schools, you’re major, and you only really take classes ifi;your»major,” she said. “I stay up until 5 a.m. talking about religion and its importance in A society with people who are not even close to my major here, and I think that’s really cool.’’ C O C V Fol‘ llly_]lll'llOl' year €l€CtlV€,* chemistry class was full, and I got stuck in this art ,_,p;;class—l had neverdone art in my life.” i . ‘ —Garbriella Z«,czi,;-A,‘,c:a¢;r,i(ls, CC ’l6 ' V Core Scholar Sc,ott’s submission to the competition was a triptych of three stori’e“s from Ovid’s ,‘.‘«..-Metamorphoses”—Lycaon,7‘ Python, ' and Periclymenus. “I did Lycaon first, before the contest,” she said. “After I heard about the contest I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll do two more and make it-a series.’ So I went back to it a half a year later.” Gabriella Zacarias, CC ’l6, discovered her artistic talent in high school by accident. ‘‘For my junior year elective, the chemistryclass was full, and I got stuck in this art classI had never done art ever in my life,” she said.

394,Music Humanities,Grant will fund more courses abroad,1 May 2013,"BY SAMANTHA COONEY ‘’ AND'CECILIAiI€EYE'S' I ’ i Spectator‘Senior Staff Writers In 2014, undergraduates who study abroad will have even more courses to choose from as Columbia continues to embrace a global mind-set. With the support of a $2.1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, administrators and faculty are embarking on a project to design and approve courses that will be offered exclusively abroad. = Nine departments have submitted 10 proposals for courses. Interim Executive Vice President ' for Arts and Sciences David Madigan, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Carlos Alonso, and Columbia College Dean James Valentini will review them with regard to instruction and budgetary possibilities. The Committee on Instruction will then have to apI prove them. » _ “Some of them are the same types that are currently taught in New York that will be modiﬁed somewhat to be taught in a location abroad,” Jack Snyder, chair of the subcommittee of global education in the Educational Policy and Planning Committee, said. “Some of them are brand , new courses that are designed speciﬁcally around the location abroad where they will be taught, dealing with the culture or his- ' tory of that area.” Faculty are still discussing the possibility of using the grant 'to offer Music. Humanities, Art Humanities, and Global Core classes. abroad, a change l-that University President Lee ' ' Bollinger has expressed a strong interest in seeing. Some courses will only be offered during the summer. In the fall of 2012, the EPPC appointed Snyder, a profes- ' sor of international relations at the School of Internationaland Public Affairs, to chair the subcommittee. He ledia survey of academic departments to evaluate how well global programs were serving their students. “We also surveyed undergraduate students, too, just_ to ﬁnd out what their plans were, what their concerns were, what their hopes were for opportunities,” he said. The survey results showed that undergraduatesmost Want to learn about a particular region’s culture, expand their O knowledge of foreign languages, and participate in summer internships or programs abroad with more ﬂexible schedules. When the committee learned that Columbia had been awarded the Mellon grant, Snyder said that “there was a question of how to turn the general language of the grant into a speciﬁc plan.” The project is estimated to last for the next six and a half years, and the Mellon Foundation has pledged another $2 million in ""support of the project after the ﬁrst three and a half years. i Four additional faculty members across all relevant departments will be appointed over the ﬁrst year. Snyder said new hireswould most likely replace senior faculty who choose to teach abroad, noting that the proposals “are designed to let current faculty members go abroad.” The locations of the new courses will not necessarily be tied to any one of the eight Global Centers, although some proposals make use of locations where Columbia already offers study abroad programs, such as Reid Hall in Paris, Snyder said. Dean of General Studies Peter Awn said he was excited to be able to offer courses that engage in a “robust, multicultural environment” to his students, though he added that there should be i careful consideration about the placement of these courses in countries that have censorship =codes. . “There is no use in meeting in an environment without intellectual freedom,” Awn said, “though it all depends on the courses.” is The global education subcommittee still has yet to hammer out logistics, including ﬁnancial aid and language prerequisites. “We’Ve made it clear that this, for us, is a big priority to make summer experiences abroad available, at least to Columbia College undergraduates,available regardless of their l personal ﬁnancial situations,” Snyder said. ‘ “One of my goals, which I have stated many times, is to be able to offer every student in the College one funded summerexperience, whether it be an internship, fellowship or study ' abroad opportunity,” Valentini ' said in an email. For most study abroad programs, ‘students are required to have completed two years"" of college language courses or the equivalent to participate. But Snyder noted that this may not be a practical requirement, given the nature of some of the new courses. A Snyder said that the, goal of the subcommittee and faculty members spearheading this project is to provide students with opportunities that interest them most, from courses abroad to undergraduate research opportunities with faculty. “I think that we should offer global education opportunities that respect the diversity of student needs and interests,” Snyder added. “We want to have a menu that has lots of really good options for students and to allow students to pick the kind ~ of experience that will be good for them.” news@columbiaspectatorzcomAROUND THE WORLD | Jack Snyder says the grant will fund new, exclusive study abroad classes."
395,Music Humanities,A pure form of learning,22 October 2013,"ou can learn a lot about a per— ‘ Yson by asking them the following question: If you had to choose to give up your sight or your hearing, which would you pick? .q ’ Cf/‘ In my case, the answer is always hearing. With the alternative, sight, ABBY I fear I’d lose so many of my favorite . MITE HELL things: seeing new places during trav- , el, the exhilarating feeling of looking at L lfe ’ S 3 a mountain seconds before ﬂying down M it C h it on skis. Skiing, for that matter-I doubt I’d be able to do that blind. Yes, it’s a silly game Without a right answer. But it does shed light on your priorities. _ The most common retort to my response to this either/or dilemma is this: “But What about music?” I like music. There are musicians I love, in fact. But I am in no way musically inclined. » My mother gave it her best shot. Piano? I refused to practice and banged my head on the keys. Violin? I got so frustrated that I threw the instrument against the wall. (Yes. I was THAT child. Sorry, Mom.) I think my mother was relieved when I ﬁnally picked = up a pen and developed some other form of artistic talent. ' . In that vein, I wasn’t looking forward to Music , Humanities. No, there isn’t any actual music-playing in the class. But you have to understand at least the basic concepts like meter, rhythm, and pitch. I Initially, my fears weren’t far from reality. I could 'understand What the professor was saying and the words’ signiﬁcance, but I couldn’t conceptually translate them to the music. But a feW,weeks of frustration later, something changed. For some strange, unexplainable reason, I started hearing the abstract concepts t I’d been struggling with. And I"" started hearing them everywhere: in the repetitive sequences in pop music, in the tone color in different artists’ voices. Even when students used “polyphony” as a descriptive ‘term in literature seminars. ‘ _ I’m not suggesting that I’m now any kind of expert, or that these revelations are at all novel to the general public. If you asked me right now, I’d probably still be un- ~ able to recognize any Beethoven aside from the opening notes of his sth Symphony. All I’m saying is that before this semester, I knew nothing-’—and didn’t have any inclination to learn about it either. The experience of taking Music Hum has been the most pure form of learning .I’ve had in college: I literally walk into the classroom as a novice, and leave pondering ideas I’d never known to exist. ' i In nearly every other class, it would be impossible to experience such a clean slate. As it should be: At any-col-lege, a student specializes, devoting most of their time academically to one ﬁeld or one historical period. I But it’s moments like these that make me reﬂect on the so-called rigidity of the Core Curriculum. Because for all you hear of the breadth of a liberal arts education, were it not for the Core I certainly wouldn’t ever have taken a music class. And I doubt I’m alone in that. Higher education is about ﬁnding your niche academically, distanced from the mandatory general studies of high school. But it should also require the uncomfortable, frustrating experience of learning without context. . I’m not convinced that the broader requirements of the majority of liberal arts schools accomplish that. It’s . ' relatively easy to cheat a distribution requirement bychoosing to ﬁll it with subjects that you’re already familiar With. In his book “College: What It Was, Is, And Should Be,” Andrew Delbanco describes the ideological struggle between Princeton president James McCosh and Harvard president Charles Eliot in the late 1800 s. McCosh defended the study of classics and, in his words, the “Trinity of Studies”: language and literature, physical science, and philosophy. Eliot had the more modern view: “A well—instructed youth of eighteen can select for himself a better course of study than any college faculty.” Eliot’s model is what you’d ﬁnd at most liberal arts schools. If there are any distribution requirements, they leave students a laundry list of options to chose from. Indeed, fellow Ivy Brown University’s “open curriculum” is the epitome of Eliot’s plan. In the words of Brown’s former president Francis Wayland, a student should be able to “study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but What he chose.” In that respect, Columbia is a relatively old-fashioned institution: A set of professors and administrators has decided that there are certain important things that We a should learn. ‘ I But it’s worth questioning whether total academic freedom should be the norm in an undergraduate education. Because despite Eliot’s assertion, I’m skeptical that any incoming student knows what to get out of college. As difﬁcult and stress-inducing as unfamiliar topics can be, facing your own ignorance is essential to becoming the informed citizen a liberal arts education purportedly strives to create.

396,Music Humanities,Non—French classes coming to Reid Hall,6 December 2013,"BY ELIZABETH SEDRAN Spectator Staff Writer Parlez-vous francais? If not, you’ll» still be able»-to «study ~ abroad in the City of Lights. A Paul LeClerc, director of Columbia’s Paris global center, wants more non—French speakers to be able to study in Paristhe most popular study abroad. destination for undergraduates. LeClerc is planning to expand English course offerings at Reid Hall, which has long housed Columbia’s Parisian study abroad programs and was 3 revamped into a global center in 2010. The new offerings could include Art Humanities and Music Humanities classes. a : “The existing undergradu'~ate programs here are‘franco—phone programs,” LeClerc said. “We’re talking about another generation of programs, where you won’t have to have such a ca-‘ pacity in French——basically, the instruction will be in English.” Departments are finishing up proposals to bring new English courses to ‘Paris ‘fin theforeseeable future,” Michael Pippenger, the dean of undergraduate global programs, said. “Once these proposals have been vetted and reviewed by the necessary faculty committees, we will have an announcement to make about that,” Pippenger said. “In the meantime, we want students to know that this may be an option, so that they can plan accordingly.” » The emphasis on English courses isn’t limited to Reid Hall, which houses programs from Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania. Pippenger said the trend toward English is manifesting itself more generally in Columbia’s study abroad programs. a “I would say 30 or 40 years ago, there was a tremendous focus on area studies,” Pippengersaid. “That model still holds for some students who have that academic interest and that desire to focus in that kind of a Way, but We also know that there are many students who would be -left out of that model.” , Pippenger said that students often excluded in this model are those interested in the sciences, who don’t necessarily need a command of a foreign language a to do research abroad. “We continue to develop new programs that might be taught in English abroad, but have an invaluable experience embedded within them for our students in terms of perusing ﬁeld studies, scientiﬁc research on the ground,” Pippenger said. “But We also continue to develop with our faculty courses taught abroad that empower our students to gain very speciﬁc ﬁeld experiences that might makemore sense for them to do in English.” He cited taking science courses, working in a laboratory, participating in an archeological dig, and doing ﬁeld research as examples of activities the new Reid courses will entail. Students said that they were intrigued by the idea of taking English classes in Paris. “Mostly, I’ve been interesting in studying abroad, but it’s hard to during the semester,” Daniel Barg, CC ’l7, said. “I’m mostly interested in Paris because I’ve taken a good amount of French.” “I’rn an engineering student, and I’ve always been interested in valuing both sides of my brain,” Sidney Perkins, SEAS ’l7, said. “I want to study abroad and enhance the humanities side in my brain, particularly at Reid Hall.” p elizabeth.sedran @columbiaspectator.comC’EST LA VIE | Paul LeClerc, right, the director of Columbia’s Paris global center and Reid Hall, is looking to increase English language course offerings for study abroad students."
397,Music Humanities,In praise of ignorance,24 January 2014,"It can be good to be ignorant. vi ;;'.é,,, a Sometimes not knowing things can L be a source of genuine happiness for 118, especially at the beginning of a new l semester. V F This isn’t to deny that ignorance of some things—like where our parents BEER hid the cookie jar—can be incredibly B Q B TEE frustrating. However, not knowing some things—-like the fact that hippopotami F 0 Ste r trample humans who come between the C 0 re them and the nearest river——can be downright dangerous. We Columbians usually associate ignorance with the distinctly unpleasant feeling of staggering out of a midterm having left multiple pages blank. But recognizing when you don’t know something can cultivate a humble spirit that longs to learn. Socrates, who boldly asked questions about everything from the nature of the afterlife to the deﬁnition of love, started with the legendary admission, “I know one thing: that I know nothing.” If we start by acknowledging our ignorance, We can venture forward into learning new things; we don’t have to stay ignorant. The most wonderful teachers—at Columbia and throughout history—couple this humility with restless curiosity. Last semester, Professor William Theodore _ de Bary (world-renowned for his expertise in East Asian classics) told students in his Nobility and Civility class that he does not teach the Analects of Confucius. Instead, he invites students into a conversation about the Analects. Despite his decades of reading Confucius, de Bary knows that the ancient text contains insight that he has yet to tap, and his students may be able to bring these riches to light. I’m hoping to learn from de Bary’s example of heroic humility as I get my ﬁrst dose of musical education with Music Humanities this semester. Growing up in rural Mozambique, I never learned what a measure is or how to count beats. Being that ignorant is really embarrassing. - But I’m trying to let my ignorance motivate me instead of silence me. I’ve had the chance to taste of Bach, Chopin, and Holst, so I know that there is enormous beauty in the Western musical tradition that I want to explore. There’s far too much to be known in the world for our little minds to grasp in a lifetime. This is one of the delights of the humanities in general, and the Core in particular. Great poetry and great philosophy make you feel foolish. Virgil and Aquinas each have subtleties that could provide material for decades of delightful study. And those‘ are just two authors! There are over two million volumes in Butler. There’s far too much to be known in the world for our little minds to grasp in a lifetime. It’s always difﬁcult to be humble enough to recognize how little we know but also maintain a passionate desire to learn all we can. , _ But Rene Descartes ,‘fDiscourseg on..t_he_i _ . _ Method”;addei'd‘ to our difﬁéiulties. Descartes is colloquially fameéliflir his maxirrifﬁithlink, therefore I am.” He came to that conclusion after a rigorous—and one might say, obsessive—process of removing from his mind every proposition of which he could not be absolutely certain. Basic beliefs, like “The material world exists” and “Other people have consciousness,” he dismissed as too doubtful. He decided that the only proposition that could not be doubted was that his own mind doing the doubting did exist. From that rock-solid base, he tried to build outward to discover other certainties using the same ironclad logic. His method strikes me as unhelpful ""and downright corrosive. Maybe that controlling spirit works well , enough for pure logic, but if I followed the Cartesian method in Music Hum, I wouldn’t learn very much. To claim certainty is to assert control, to seize power I over facts and ideas and truth claims. Descartes robs us of the wonder of admitting that the world is full of mysteries beyond our control and our ken. That doesn’t mean we should give up the quest to know; it’s a quest full of a risky joy, requiring our hearts and wills as well as our minds. ' That joy is why I love leading Veritas discussion groups. In small groups once a week, ﬁrst-years meet with their ﬂoormates, humbling themselves to admit their ignorance about one another’s values and world views. Yet the discussion doesn’t just delve into questions of identity. These small communities"" of truth-seekers confront the “big questions” together, daring to imagine I that they might find answers to, “Does my life have meaning?”, “Is love real?”, and “Could morality be objective?” Our Columbia community could—and should—be a place where we acknowledge the ﬁnitude of our minds and the vastness of what there_is to be known and set out on the adventure of discovery together.. Different disciplines—-from philosophy to physics, and literature to linguistics—ask perennial human questions about our place in the world. The Core gives us a platform from which to glimpse the unity of truth and yet teaches us to bow before the depth and breadth of it all. Those names are high up on Butler to make us feel small and wonderfully ignorant. Luke Foster is a Columbia College junior majoring in English.

It was not immediately clear Why Middle East House no longer has the space—current members did not respond to requests for comment. “I’m excited to bring more jazz to people» because I think there’s a'sort of lack of it at Columbia. We just have our combo performances,” Jake Chapman, CC ’l6 and one of the founders of Jazz House, said. Jazz House plans on hosting performances and jam sessions, ultimately making jazz more accessible to the Columbia community. . “Living in a community. focused on jazz is vitally important for any musician,” Chris Washburne, director of the Louis Armstrong Jazz _ Performance Program at Columbia, said. Ben Rosenblum, CC ’l6 and another founder of Jazz House, said he hopes the space will provide “a way of putting jazz into a visible position on Columbia’s campus and a placeWhere you can be introduced to it so easily.” ‘ . “I’m living with some of my favorite musicians in New York. These are people who are going to be amazing professional musicians some day,” Rosenblum said. “Being in the same space with them and other people who have such great ideas and a drive—There is so much potential for us’ to create new ideas.” a Columbia has about 130 students involved with the Louis Armstrong Jazz Performance Program, which consists of various performance groups that practice throughout the year for a joint performance at the end of each semester. . One of the goals of Jazz House, Chapman said, will be increasing performance opportunities for campus musi- l cians. He said he hopes that, the space in River will create more flexible opportunities for musicians tomeet upand play together. V 4 ' ‘ “Maybe there’s some ‘kind of recital We’d program, but . that was just us doing it of r our own accord,” he said. f‘We want to be around people that share interest, and we because vve’re around them all the time, there are opportunities for collaboration.” V V H H Rosenblum said that the application process to become a l special interest community lwas “arduous.” Jazz House’s application was seven pages long, and the group outlined its plans as a special interest community in front of a selection committee—a process not too dissimilar to last year’s. Chapman said that Jazz House wants to collaborate with other special interest communities like Writers ‘ House and Potluck House to host events with similarinterests, like a lecture on literature in the Jazz Age. “The Columbia community has been really exposed to jazz on a level more profound level i than any other universities,” Washburne said. “It’s a philosophy, it’s a way oflife, and it’s something communal.” Rosenblum and Washburne see the awarding of Jazz House as institutional acknowledgement of the growing jazz program. It’s creation comes after Music Humanities included a jazz component in 2003. H ‘ “I’m most excited about being able to bring jazz to the community and having some kind of institutional backing that will help us to success- ' fully hold events,” Rosenblum said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to throw concerts regularly and have lectures and events.” Eva Kalikoff contributed reporting. . elz'zabeth.sedran @columbiaspectator.comMUSIC IN THE STREETS | Jazz House will occupy the first floor of River Hall on 114th Street."
399,Music Humanities,Why Columbians need to start singing together,28 March 2014,"()n the last night of spring break, : I spent an hour going toe-to-toe 7 S . with a ﬁrst-year from Harvard, belting out every line we could remember from g “Les Misérables” at the top of our lungsHe and I successfully got through “The _ Confrontation,” “Look Down,” and even LEKE V the frenetic “Red and Black.” Eventually F3S T E R we ran out of steam, sore of throat and FOS t e r , ﬂushed of face, but having found a new depth of friendship and joy. 1: 11 e Col' 3 I feel about singing the way Ido about soccer: I’m terribly incompetent at it, yet I revel in it. Though I know that anyone with minimal training or talentis sure to sing better than me, there’s still something magical about creating the music myself. Not everything should be left solely to the experts, even though they are orders of magnitude better at what they do than what we amateurs could ever do. While Barcelona fans like me certainly love watchingEl Clasico tri— . umphs like last weekend’s, there remains something uniquely pleasurable about holding your own.Clasico, playing one—on- ’ ones in the backyard against your friend the Madrid jersey. , But some arts don’t lend themselves to amateur per- ' formances so easily. The content of Music Humanities doesn’t seem remotely approachable. I wouldn’t dare to sing Monteverdi’s “Possente spirto” or Mozart’s “La ci darem V la mano” or even Schubert’s “Erlk6nig.?’ This music is virtuosic, the rareﬁed province of those whospend their lives reﬁning their musical crafts. It’s also distinctly elite, made for the Vatican, the imperial court, or the monied middle classes. To this day, classical concert halls remain places of socioeconomic privilege and repositories of cultural capital. Lincoln Center is in the Upper West Side—not the South Bronx, -- Before the 20th century, the classical music that we study in Music Hum really was remote from most “ordinary” people. But then, mass media indelibly impacted Western culture. Radio brought Chopin, Beethoven, and Bach to millions, TV made things even easier, and now the Internet has given us inexhaustible amounts of wonderful music for free. Just search You Tube or Spotify! But no simple narrative of progress or decline will do for explaining the trajectory of a culture. So, even as many great masterpieces became accessible for the ﬁrst time, the wonderful achievements of mass media came at a hidden cost. The Internet has helped carve out space for independent musicians to share their work widely and cheaply, giving ‘ sensations like You Tube violinist Lindsey Stirling a chance I to shine. But culturally inﬂuential music has become more and more the province of polished experts. To use my earlier analogy: It is as if almost everyone has stopped playing soccer for themselves to watch Barcelona because the pros are so much better. ' A This is a sweeping claim, and of course the musical history here is very complicated. But basically, “average” Americans sing and play music in groups in everyday life today a lot less than they did 100 yearsago. Part of the joy of making music lies in making it with other people. To complement each other’s voices and to harmonize and produce a uniquely beautiful synthesis are to develop community in a distinctly powerful way. _, . . 5 I 7~ A generation ago many children grew up *singing ' “Amazing Grace” and myriad other hymns. Church is a smaller part of our national and cultural life now. But it’s notable that folk songs, too, used to provide common ground across broad cross-sections of America. In World War I, soldiers at the legendary Christmas Truce crossed no man’s land to sing carols like “Auld Lang Syne”—commonly known because more children grew up singing together. ' Instead of these usually anonymous folk songs that arose from everyday experience, 21st-century Americans know brands: Pitbull, Justin Bieber, and Riharma. These “pop” tunes aren’t organically popular in the sense that folk songs are; they are commercial vehicles, vetted and disseminated by a few giant media corporations like MTV and Atlantic « Records. Instead of the unashamedly aristocratic compositions of Music Hum or the understated dignity of the gospelderived civil rights anthem “We Shall Overcome,” most of the new songs that we hold in common today have been packaged by soullesss marketing teams from the music industry and handed down to us like pablum. - I think we should feel that there’s something precious lost when most of the music we consume has been prepackaged for us. I think there’s something lost when we no longer grow up knowing the beauty of singing together as a community. Columbia’s campus offers chances to hear wonderful a cappella, choral, and instrumental student groups, but we as a community barely sing together beyond a verse of ' “Roar, Lion, Roar” at basketball games. Can we remedy this situation? We can and should invest time in appreciating the depths and riches of the world of excellent traditional music that is open to us. Cherish Music Hum, which challenges people like me—people who have no musical background—to learn to distinguish duple and triple meter. Then, seek outchances to sing together. ' We’ll awkwardly come to know the twin joys of singing amateurishly and singing in community. And we have just the songs to do so—-two of the great songsof our academic community in Morningside Heights should be rediscovered. “Stand, Columbia” and “Sans Souci,” Columbia’s alma mater songs should be claimed proudly. , “Mother, stay’d on rock eternal,/ Crown’d and set upon a height,/ Gloriﬁed by Light supernal.” .

401,Music Humanities,Traditions that venerate women are overlooked,9 April 2014,"BY LUKE FOSTER . ~ The Core Curriculum, with its power to open our minds and hearts, has a way of confronting us with unpalatable perspectives. If the ﬁelds of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities are like quiet pas- _ _ ture_s of contemplation tucked away above the clouds of our everyday assumptions, sometimes there is a stiff, cold windblowing in these uplands. And it can slap us in the face, abruptly and unpleasantly. The dearth of women authors in the Core is one such jarring reality. It is disconcerting that with all the poetry by women in the ancient world, not much survives beyond a few fragments of Sappho. Even in much more familiar and recent contexts, women’s voices have been marginalized. All of Evans’ ; work was published under a pseudonym, George Eliot. One common response to this problem is to read the women who did author Core texts—Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf- ‘ as speaking only for women. My Contemporary Civilization class spent a great deal of time asking if Wollstonecraft was a proto -feminist, and in Lit Hum we questioned whether Austen was trying to subvert the sexual norms of her time. What bothers me about this approach is that it canactually be degrading to the authors and their ideas. None of these authors were directly concerned with the political ideologies of our time, and we shouldn’t . try to ﬁt them into our categories, or repurpose their work for another meaning. To honor their achievements in providing insight into human nature is to _ be willing to listen to what they have to say about all _of our experiences. Austen is a brilliant satirist who introduces her readers to sparkling depths of subtlety in the most everyday conversations. We often assume that our age has progressed and N that women are better treated now than ever before. In manyvital areas, that claim is justiﬁed. In 21st—century Western society, fewer women die during childbirth ' than at any other point in our history. Today, Mary Ann Evans would be encouraged to publish her own work and regarded as an excellent writer in her own right. But one of the great merits of the Core is its power to let ideas from starkly different times speak for themselves. And just as we should respect and listen to other cultures on their own terms, we should extend the same generosity of spirit to our ancestors. . We sometimes stereotype the entirety of Western thought as a Faust—like ﬁgure: the rationalistic male intellectual who seduces, silences, and objectiﬁes ‘ Gretchen. But there is much more to the great tradition of the West than that. One of the tenderestmoments in the Iliad comes as Hector returns from the bloodshed to his Wife Andromache and his baby son Astyanax. Hector recognizes that male-Warrior glory, kleos, is only valuable because it protects the domestic realm that his wife governs. _ And the rise of Christianity in the ancient World provided further reason to dignify Women. The Gospel of Luke tells the story of the Virgin Mary and claims she changed history by choosing to bear and raise the baby Jesus. Mary’s song, the Magniﬁcat, proclaims, “From now on all generations will call me blessed,” and this elevation of motherhood to an ofﬁce of eternal glory would suffuse later Christian thought. Augustine, in his Confessions, acknowledges the saintliness of his mother Monica, a constant source of stability for him while he does his best to destroy himself. The Core exposes us to a tradition that ennobled and honored women as mothers, even as it often conﬁned women to the domestic sphere. It's Worth asking ourselves whether our contemporary culture is truly better at valuing women. Yes, We do better at acknowledging the excellence of Women, but we tend to measure excellence in quantiﬁable achievements like earning a paycheck or contributing to the GDP. ‘ The vast sacriﬁce of health, time, and love that millions of mothers—including my own-—give to their children is too often denigrated. Prioritizingmotherhood should be an honored choice for Women to make. But the dominant narrative is that an excellent education shouldn’t be channeled into raising children. Too many college campuses, including ‘ Columbia, fail to do enough to help student mothers. The ﬁnal Week of Art Humanities, last spring made this point tangible for me. My professor juxtaposed Raphael’s’ Sistine Madonna and Picasso’s Les Demoiselles Diélvignon. The 16th-century painting integrated all its elements, with harmony and grace, around the queenly poise of Mary, the Mother of God And the 20th-century cubist piece rendered the viewer complicit in the horrifyingvoyeurism of the female body stripped down to an object The Core hammered home to me the irony that, even though there are more women in board rooms and in faculty lounges than ever before, the Western world has become complacent with a vast industry dedicated to the obj ectiﬁca—tion of women: pornography. _ Clearly, in some vital Ways, we are missing wisdom that our ancestors would have taken for granted. We should honor the women of the Core for their excellence, not just for their politics, and we should also allow the Core to challenge us to strive for a more complete vision of Women’s dignity.

402,Music Humanities,Create a separate class to explore women’s writing,9 April 2014,"BY BRITT FOSSUM Barnard College’s First-Year Foundations courses, First-Year Seminar and First-Year English, are a required part of the—Barnard curriculum for all students. Unlike Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, these classes don’t share a syllabus of texts but rather have speciﬁc focal topics. One is dedicated to “Women and Culture.” The two other major literature courses’ syllabi, on the other hand, are full of male writers and thinkers, though one of the two does include several writers excluded from Literature ‘ Humanities, such as Margery Kempe, Madame de Lafayette, and Mary Shelley. A different focus is needed in order to deal with female voices because of a disappointing truth about the past: The writers and philosophers we acknowledge and celebrate were not women. Even the inclusion of the aforementioned writers is somewhat questionable. Were the texts The Book of Margery Kempe, The Princesse den Cleves, or even Frankenstein truly so signiﬁcant.in their time that they warrant sharing a syllabus with Don Quixote or the Odyssey? Texts included in the Core Curriculum must be signiﬁcant today. But when these classes are also framed as part of a study of Western thought, the texts must have been inﬂuential in their own time periods. The syllabus for Literature Humanities, for example, is carefully put together (and sometimes modiﬁed by professors) to ﬁt a particular pattern of Western thought; the rise of interiority and the inner self. This process culminates in Virginia Woolf—her To the Lighthouse is difﬁcult to read and downright armoying, but it really is the perfect book to ﬁnish Lit Hum with, as an example of internal narrative. ,But does it reallybeneﬁt the Core Curriculum to throw in additional female writers just for the sake of having more female voices? ' Columbia can’t improve the Core byethrowing in gratuitous female writers. By limiting the scope of Core classes to the traditional canon of literature and philosophy, ﬁrst-years will read Jane Austen as the ﬁrst female writer. Is there really any way around this? All We have left is scraps of Sappho’s poetry and a few works by medieval writers and theologians. There are, of course, excellent female vvriters——it is just that the set criteria that deﬁne the Core Curriculum must exclude them. Finding female writers who inﬂuenced mainstream thought in their time requires broadening the scope of the Core syllabus. What of Lady Murasaki’s The Tale of Genji? As a Japanese writer, Lady-Murasaki clearly wrote outside of the Western tradition. Similarly, women writers, even’those‘considered to be from the Western world, also-wrote outside of the Western tradition of the time, which largely excluded women. . * Would anyone really choose ‘to drop Inferno in favor of a lesser (or lesser-known and referenced) work just for the sake of adding another woman’s name to the list? In this vein, some Contemporary Civilization professors- choose to teach John Stuart Mill’s The Subjection ofWomen instead of Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman because Mill’s text is more rigorous and well-written. So why not do as Barnard has done and add the option of a women’s studies course to the Core? We have Global Core classes to present a non-Western viewpoint (another critique of the Core), so why not also focus on women in a‘ separate class? There are plenty of fascinating courses that focus on women and literature by women, but Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and Art and Music Humanities have very different foci. They are stuvey courses, and unfortunately for women throughout history, only in very recent centuries have Women been free enough in society to show up on a “greatest hits” list of inﬂuential thinkers. . _ Adding extra women to the Core constructs a false history—-one where women were able to have their thoughts celebrated and held to the same standards as men. We don’t need to have women’s works lumped into a narrative of philosophical development from which their Works were forcibly excluded or never had the chance to exist. The great women of history deserve their own narrative— one that is very different from that of the traditional Western canon. A Britt Fossum is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in chemistry.

403,Music Humanities,Letting go of grade inflation and fear of failure,16 April 2014,"BY VIKAS ARUN As I was studying for a midterm last Tuesday, Columbia College Student Council andiEngineering Student Council candidates knocked on my door and promised, among other things, that they would make the grading curves at Columbia more fair. Unaware of any grading curve problem, I turned to a popular new grade.-distribution website for answers: gradesatcu.com. _ ‘ What greeted me on the home page was a shocking graph. In the 2010-11 school year, 60% of students in non-. Core humanities classes received A-range grades, as well as all 65 percent of students in arts classes, 60 percent of students in Core classes, and 75 percent of students in ‘ Music Humanities. In addition, every group of disciplines ' on the graph has witnessed a steady increase in the per-centage:ofA-range grades since 1994-95. ‘ I was completely thrown by the size of the problem at Columbia. It seems inappropriate that Columbia, which prides itself on its rigorous curriculum, should have any department where a student is more likely to have an A ' than any other grade combined. The classic response to this phenomenon is found in a 2011 Spectator article. Here, political science professor . Jack Snyder argues that students at Columbia and other Ivy Leagues are “above average in their basic capacities, so why shouldn’t many of them do well and get good grades?” My fellow Columbians are undoubtedly above aver- . age, but Snyder’s assumption that grades should reﬂect one’s caliber with respect to the average student is highly inaccurate. Grades should reﬂect a student’s caliber with respect to the other students within his or her institution, not other institutions. If you disagree with this,.then you should disagree with the calculation of your high school _ GPA, too. « In high school, most Columbians received amazing GPAs because they were the smartest students at their schools, and Columbia determined how this GPA compared to GPAs from other high schools. High schools can- ' not possibly determine how their students stack up with other high school students. They leave thatto colleges to ﬁgure out. ~ ‘ The same should hold true for college: Columbia students should receive GPAs based on how they do compared to their peers,.and employers can decide how a ‘ V Columbia GPA compares to other GPAs. If we were to . follow Mr. Snyder’s suggestion and grade everyone at ' Columbia based on how they compare to the average student, many Columbia students would be receiving straight A+’s. I' This trend in grading underlines a ﬂaw, not just of Columbians, but of most intellectually capable students in our generation. It encourages a fear of failure. _ t Because so many classes give over 50 percent of their grades in the A range—one section of Intermediate Spanish I gave 88 percent of its students A-range grades—' ‘ the A becomes the norm. Perfection becomes the norm. ‘ When that happens, students begin to expect perfection of 5 themselves, and in order to achieve it, they sacriﬁce every— l thing to get it. K A This shows itself most evidently on CULPA. Many of 3 T the gold—nugget professors on CULPA are described as ‘lenient graders. Students who do well in a class are more i ‘ likely to write positive reviews for a professor, increasing the likelihood that that profesésoar will receive a nugget, A despite the fact that CULPAis; meant to evaluate a pro_fes- . sor’s teachingeabilsty—not grading leniency. For example, the sole goldinugget professor in the industrial engineering and operations researchgdepartment-is Anthony Webster, who, according to a reviewer, gives 40 percent ' A-range grades. Meanwhile, professors who are hailed ~ for their teaching, such as Sunil Gulati, Susan Elmes, and Michael Como, but criticized for their grading policies ’ don’t get the same honor. Given this environment, stu- , dents are more likely to pick classes largely based off of who they think will be the easiest grader. . . This cycle can be dangerous because it encourages us to avoid failure rather than pick ourselves up.from it. It builds up the perfectionist notions we gained in high school rather than challenging them. Thanks to grade inﬂation, we are conditioned to-press a restart button that doesn’t exist in the real world. You can’t restart a job in , order to perform better or abandon it just because everything didn’t go your way, yet we constantly escape along these exact avenues at Columbia. Our school has implicitly taught us to.run away from failure. That inability to cope is going to have someintense consequences. As such, putting aside the fact that I, like all students at ' Columbia, don’t mind the extra boost from grade inﬂation, I’m worried about the message it sends. I’m worried about the environment it creates, and I’m worried that it encourages sacriﬁcing learning for a higher GPA. Myghope is that V as students, we can put our egos aside, realize that our GPAs don’t deﬁne us, and use this realization to allow us , to focus on learning, rather than résumé building. After all, isn’t that what college is supposed to be about?

Art Humanities and Music Humanities will be offered at l Reid Hall in the spring of 2015, a change that comes as Columbia pushes to expand its Englishlanguage offerings abroad. The music and art history de- ' partments applied separately to bring courses to Paris and have spent the past year designing and coordinating their individual courses. The expansion of both courses will be funded by a $2.1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, which faculty and administrators are using to design and teach courses abroad. According to Dean of Undergraduate Global Programs Michael Pippengen the grant “was given to Columbia to help globalize the liberal arts.” Though the courses will be taught simultaneously next spring, further scheduling will depend on students’ responses and faculty availability. Music department chair Giuseppe Gerbino is . conﬁdentboth courses are at Reid Hall to stay, and he said a summer course may also be in the Works. “Going forward, we will offer, of course, both the courses at least once a year—which isto say either in the fall or in the spring,” Gerbino said. “The calendar itself is not necessarily ﬁxed at thispoint. The maximum capacity for this would befall, spring, a summer.” » Though Paris is already the most popular location for Columbia undergraduate study abroad, Gerbino said he hopes the ability to fulﬁll Core requirements will attract even more Columbia students to Reid Hall.

405,Music Humanities,CCSC plans return of Columbia College Days,16 October 2014,"BY DYLAN COOPER Spectator Staﬁ"" Writer Two years after Columbia College Student Council chose to replace College Dayswith the Columbia Music Festival, student leaders are now planning to reinstate the Weeklong celebration of Columbia College spirit. Tentatively scheduled for the ﬁrst week of April, CCSC members said they want to build each day around a different Core Curriculum class. 1 “In Columbia College, there’s a need for big headliner events that the campus could rally around,” CCSC Vice President for Campus Life Andrew Ren, CC ’l5, said. “And College Days could do just that.” College Days will launch with an opening ceremony and campus-wide displays celebrating Literature Humanities Day. The rest of the week will include Contemporary Civilization Day highlighting Columbia’s history, Art Humanities Day featuring stu- V dent artwork and workshops, and Swim Test Day focusing on more fun activities and promoting selfcare tips. Global Core/Science Requirement Day will feature events organized by student groups, while Ren said he wants to work with campus music groups to organize performances‘ for Music Humanities Day. g “In coming up with a framework, it is crucial that College Days would have a very organized structure,” Ren said. “We want to create a template that could be instituted for future yearsas well.” » Ren said that having experienced College Days as a ﬁrst-year, he thinks there is a lack of events speciﬁcally geared toward’promoting Columbia College spirit. “There was a conspicuous absence of something celebrating being a Columbia College student and that’s why the event is in existence,” he said. Engineering Student Council has held an annual Engineering Week featuring speakers, workshops, and activities since 1996, while Barnard’s Student Government Association holds an armual Spirit Week in April, thelatest iteration of Barnard’s longrunning Greek Games tradition. CCSC created College Days in 2002, and the initiative expanded—and became more expensive—every year. The 2004 week featured a scavenger hunt with a $4OO grand prize and a $2OO dinner with an alumnus as the sec-ond-place prize. The spring 2012 week had a budget of $20,000 and featured multiple giveaways by the council. “The scavenger hunt was really fun and people liked it a lot,” Chloe Good, CC ’O6, one of the organizers of College Days that year said. “The reason we didn’t do it again was it was very logistically heavy.” CCSC canceled College Days in December that year, opting to use the money to host the Columbia Music Festival in the week leading up to the Bacchanal spring concert. Some students said that they would be interested in having special Core classes during the week. “I think it’s pretty obvious Columbia’s lacking in the spirit department,” Bryan Kao, CC ’lB, said. “Hopefully College Days will give us something to look forward to in the spring.” “College Days would deﬁnitely appeal to seniors because it’d be a refreshing recap of the Core,” Michael Schiff, CC ’l5, said. “Being a part of grade-wide CC lecture, for example, could be really interesting if they brought in a famous or iconic lecturer.” This year’s College Days ap- ' pears to be a shift away from previous years’ giveaway- driven events. ' Schiff said that he would like College Days to include largerscale events that could catch students’ attention. “It’d be really nice to see a grand display around campus or some type of performing arts entertainment on Low Steps,” he said. “The idea is to have a mix of active participation and passive events ‘ depending on the day, where you as a student are able to engage as much or as little as you’d want,” Ren said. dylan.cooper @coZumbiaspectator.com"

The Faculty of Arts and - Sciences, which comprises ﬁve of the University’s schools’ including Columbia College and the School of General Studies, pays adjuncts a base of $5,000 per course. Departments, depending on their budgets, have the ability to increase that pay, which led adjunct salaries to .—.._...._—1__......._...._fluctuate across departments surveyed in the analysis. Only three out of the 10 departments covered in the analysis paid the exact base rate, while visual arts was the only department that paid some adjuncts below base. Political science chair Page Fortna told Spectator in an email in the spring that she ' had not seen the base change in over a decade. “It is outrageous that Cplumbia has not raised the base pay for adjuncts (currently ssk per course) in I’m not sure how many years——at least 15 years (I know it hasn’t3-*.§.i ﬁludged s__inC.€_ I arrived in 1999) think even longer,” she"" jﬁvrote.

The University’s fac-as “experts in special fields of knowledge who are appointed _. for a stated term to offer instruction part-time while pursuing their primary careers outside the University.” Some adjuncts do indeed have other professional careers or are former professors looking for extra money in their retirement. Provost John Coatsworth told Spectator in April that he believes most"" of Columbia’s adjuncts fall into this category. = T ‘S ' But other adjuncts do have to balance multiple teaching jobs at more than one--institution. DEPARTMENTS THAT PAY g THE BASE An adjunct in the French department reported being paid $5,000 per course, the base salary for the department. ’ - The French adjunct, who A asked to remain anonymous, said the position was offered‘ with the $5,000 per course salary up front. .. r i “That was made very clear to me when I came to Columbia and spoke with the person that would be in charge of the languages,” the adjunct said. “She was a bit embarrassed to tell me the price—she even apologized.” Similarly, adjuncts in the classics department are paid $5,000 per course, according to Department Chair Deborah Steiner. S “That’s just University policy, that’s not our-policy,” Steiner said, adding that she believes adjuncts deserve more than $5,000 a course. “These people are desperately underpaid,” she said. “Many of them are way overqualified. They don’t get any benefits, they don’t get any job security. So, it’s a very, very unfortunate situation, but We have a choice, becausewe don’t have enough faculty . members nor enough graduate students to supply the bodies to teach those classes.” I The music department’s por adjuncts also pays $5,000 per course, according to Music Department Chair Susan Boynton. T But Boynton believesadjuncthiring is a necessary evil. “It’s always in response to curricular needs,” Boynton told Spectator in the spring. “The staffing of courses like Music Humanities can sometimes require varying numbers of adjunct instructors because Music Humanities has to be offered in a large number of sections, and we’re a small department.” S DEPARTMENTS THAT PAY ABOVE THE BASE ‘But some departments in the Arts _and Sciences do pay their adjuncts vwell—and, in some cases, triple Columbia’s base pay and pay five times the , national average. Topping the list is the economics department, in which adjuncts receive $15,000 checks_per course-—over three times What some Columbia visual arts adjuncts are paid.. The economics department chair declined to comment on departmental salaries. The reasons Why some departments pay their adjuncts pmore can be attributed to ‘a number of factors, including the department’s budget and spending priorities. Sociology Department Chair Gil Eyal said that adjuncts in his department are paid slo,ooo——a rate that has remained stable for the past few years—because of a decision by a previous chair to use the department budget to supplement base pay. “It was a department practice. We think, in general, adjuncts are paid too little,” Eyalsaid. “There’s only so much we can do—our budget is not that big.” An adjunct in the art history department—in which adjuncts reported salariesof $B,OOO per course—attributed the higher salaries to a need to stay competitive in hiring faculty. ' “The academic job market is pretty competitive,” an art history adjunct, who has requested to also remain anonymous, said. “Columbia’s pay is better than most other schools.” E An adjunct in the historydepartment, who also requested to remain anonymous, receives $8,400 per course, according to a pay stub from last year. Adjunct Professor Michael Sikorski, who makes $lO,OOO per course, only teaches one computer science course at Columbia in the fall. He creates his own material for class, brings it to campus, and teaches it. ‘ But getting a teaching position at Columbia wasn’t easy for Sikorski. “Going through the process is pretty difficult, you know,even with professor support,” Sikorski said. “I had to send lots of communications being like, ‘I want to teach.’ You deﬁnitely get a little bit of the ‘ feeling that education isn’t first and foremost. The professors are busy Working on their papers and their research.” “Sometimes, we [adjuncts] slip through the cracks a little bit,” Sikorski said. J.

407,Music Humanities,Joint Music and Art Hum class will be offered,8 October 2015,"BY I-lANA KATEMAN Columbia Daily Spectator . , Startingnext semester, students will be able to take Art Humaniﬁes and Music Humanities simultaneously, which instructors hope will allow for more holistic engagement with the material. The two classes will meet four times a week, twice for each dis- . cipline. The spring 2016 program will be offered to 22 students on the Morningside Heights campus. Applications for the joint course were released in an email sent by the Center for the Core Curriculum last Thursday. The joint course offering comes after a successful trial run this past summer at Reid Hall, Columbia’s global center in Paris. The Music Hum portion of the course will be taught by music department chair Susan Boynton, while the Art Hum portion of the course will be taught by Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow Joseph Ackley. Both professors will attend all lectures as well as class outings to museums and concerts. _ , Ackley spoke of his excitement over the creation of the linked class and his expectations for the collaboration between them. “I think when you talk about ‘ visual material and aural material, there’s so many differences . between the two-but looked at broadly, there are many resonances,” Ackley said. “I think that there are going to be many surprising points of connection between the two bodies of work.” Gillian Carling, CC ’l7 and a student who took the joint course in Paris, said that there is . a beneﬁt to taking both courses simultaneously. ’ ‘_ “I’m a science major, so I really liked taking them both at once be- a cause I’ve never really written esA 1 -say§‘like*‘ that before %'1b011lI.§“f-‘C and music,"" Carling said. “I doing ' ‘ both at once re‘ally- Helped?b€icause I got extra practice, and I got more into that mindset for a while.” , While the syllabi for the two courses were somewhat coordinated by theme and time period, professor Robert E. Harrist Jr., the Paris program’s Art Hum inA structor, believes some ‘of the most enriching experiences at the summer program were the spontaneous overlaps between the courses, a sentiment echoed by students. “I think in terms of timeline, they may not match each other perfectly, but they go simultaneously. Like, similar enoughpto be able to draw comparisons,” Christy Chung, CC ’lB and a Paris program participant, said. “You really see one idea that’s prominent not only in music and art, but perhaps also literature. It’s much more overt when you do Art and Music . Humanities together——you see the A manifestation.” While this springwill only offer one section of the linked course, Boynton hopes to see growth in the future. However, she believes expansion is limited by scheduling and faculty interest. According to Boynton, teaching one of the combined courses is not only a time commitment, but an intellectual commitment as well. “It means being part of some- » one else’s class. It means effectively j becoming a student of that other a person and going along to the museum visits, which are extensive,” _Boynton said. “Not every faculty member has the time or inclination to do that kind of teaching.” _ Harrist pointed out that students choosing to take both cours- ’ es also mustbe prepared to take on the commitment to intensely focus on these classes. A “It’s not for everybody, but it’s for people who are just sort of art and music types,” Harrist said. Students who would like to participate in the spring 2016 combined course must submit an application requiring an unofficial transcript and a 250-word essay describing interest.

408,Music Humanities,Boyce renews spirit at SEAS,29 October 2015,"New InltlatlVes, faculty hll'€S school Spectator Senior Staff Writer Two and a half years into her tenure, School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Mary Boyce has brought renewed en- t ergy to the school, sparking the"" creation of a series of initiatives that has reanimated both faculty and students. ' Columbia trumpeted Boyce’s appointment as a high-pro-ﬁle hire in March 2013 after the University stole Boyce away from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where ‘ she had taught for over 25 years. Her appointment marked the end of a Volatile decade for SEAS, following former Dean ' Feniosky Peﬁa-Mora’s resignation after SEAS faculty passed a vote of “no conﬁdence” in him. Her appointment helped put SEAS on the map, according to Robert McCaughey, a history professor at Barnard and the author of “A Lever Long Enough: A History of Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science Since 1864.” “She is an important person in her discipline, coming fromthe top engineering school in the. world, a member of the National Academy of Engineering. She came in with instant impact in terms of the visibility of the institution,” Mccaugheyésaid. “And then from everything I hear, she’s "" performed as expected.” ' According to administrators, faculty and students inter- » viewed by Spectator, Boyce has successfully fostered interdis- ' ciplinary collaboration with the other schools at the University, S authorizeda series of signiﬁcant renovations, and worked to emphasize to students how exciting engineering is. “I think Columbia missed a coupleof turns in the wheel , when engineering was revived in the ‘6os and ‘7os, and places like MIT and Stanford re- . ally took advantage of them and Columbia kind of fumbled along,” McCaughey said. “This round, I think Columbia has moved as smartly as any.” _ I TRANSCENDING DISCIPLINES A central tenet of Boyce’s vision is to enable engineering students and faculty to tackle _ the “global challenges of the ‘ world” through interdisciplinary work. “We’re looking now that our engineering education is a foundational education,” Boyce said. ’ “At the undergraduate level, we do consider a key part of that [to be] our requirement of a part of the core curriculum, because we think that also informs the broader perspectiveof our role in the world, and how engineeringcomes to bear on that.” Engineering students * at Columbia are required to take half of the humanities core; they choose between Literature Humanities, ‘ Contemporary Civilization, or V two Global Core courses, and either Art Humanities or Music Humanities. The approach is one that Boyce believes distinguishes SEAS from its peers and appeals to. students who value interdisciplinary collaboration. V “We are attracting students who seeengineering in that foundational way,” Boyce said. “So I do think we attract anincredible talent that is broader than what you mightsee in some other top engineering schools.” V 4 .According to McCaughey, Boyce’s interest in pursuing interdisciplinary work is the_ continuation of work that administrators at SEAS began in the 19905. . ' ' “I don’t think [the emphasis on transdisciplinary collaboration] can be attributed to the most recent clean, but I think what Dean Boyce. has ' recognized is that that is one . of the key elements in the perceived success of_ the institution and engineering school,” McCaughey, said. “And I think it’s now the case that you cannot , think seriously of any collaboration within the University that does not include the engineering school.” i According to Soulaymane Kachani, senior vice dean for academic programs at SEAS, past administrators had also hoped to foster interschool, collaboration, but there was “nothing that was meaningful that came with that” “until Boyce came to campus. “She came here and said,‘ ‘We have to ""cross to all the schools, to all the disciplines, and see where we can add value,”’ Kachani said. “It’s not like we ' weren’t doing that before, [but] I donit think we were doing it in an organized way.” One of the most notable ex— ’ amples of this visionhas been‘ the creation of the Ebola design challenge in 2014. The challenge, which spanned the . course’ of two weeks, tasked participants from SEAS and the Mailman School of Public Health to work in teams to develop a low—cost, technology- » driven -solution that would meet a challenge‘ posed by’ the outbreak of Ebola. The chalv lenge sparked‘ the creation of Highlight, a powdered bleach additive that can beused to decontaminate infectious diseases. The invention won the USAID Fighting ‘Ebola Grand » ‘Challenge and has sincebeen r incorporated into the New York City Fire Department’s HazMat unit decontamination protocol. ' r Boyce, who created the event after discussing the Ebola crisiswith Mailman School of Public Health Dean Linda Fried, herself participated in the challenge, serving as a research adviser. .. . _ Ritish Patnaik,’ SEAS ’l6, A praised the event, and noted that it allowed him to work with Boyce not in the capacity of anadministrator, but as a researcher. . “I came to the Ebola design challenge kickoff presentation, and I was interested‘ in the idea . of protective suits. The next day, . Dean Boyce is sitting there, and she’s sketching out a suit, and I had a sketch‘ of a suit in my backpack, and we sat down and started compiling our sketches , and working together,” Patnaik said. . “She would take time out of her day to come down to the BME [biomedical engineering] ‘ lab just to see how things were going, to see‘ if she could give us advice,” he added. Boyce also has worked to collaborate with the Business School, spearheading the? creation of a new class called . Research to Revenue-, which will be offered to business and engineering students in the first V half of sprilngsyemester. The course will encourage students to work in teams to tackle both -the technical and entrepreneur- . ial challenges of developing technology. ‘ . » “Something Dean Boyce v wants to do is not just think, about these ideas, but really do them. And that’s why we are offering this as soon as possible, not waiting until next year,” Sam Sia, an associate professor of biomedical engineering who is helping to craft the course, said. “We want to"",d9_.-,_it now “and we want to giveiiltlsltadents resources now.” I a . INVESTMENTS IN FACULTY AND SPACE Perhaps the largest challenge facing SEAS‘ that Boyce habislought to tackle has been I ' the school’s space constraints. »Crunch_ed for laboratory space, faculty and students havehistorically felt the coiggequences of Columbia’s spaéellimitations acutely. This probl3ﬁ%*that has directly affected tl3l:el'school’s V ability to competitively recruit faculty.*""‘lt’s a limiting factor. You want to be able to do your research, and you need to have the space to do your research. It’s probably how you’re going to A get tenure,” David Vallancourt, . a senior lecturer in circuits and systems in the department of electrical engineering, said. ' But under Boyce’s leadership, SEAS has invested in a series of renovations, expanding S and refurbishing lab and ofﬁce spaces. ‘ . = ' “We’re undergoing some rathermassive renovations to build out and bring more labs up to the level we need to be at for the type of work we’re doing. That’s a major priority of the school,” Boyce said. “We have a big effort to try to bring our current spaces up to , the level where I think we need ‘ to be.” ‘ g A A Those construction proj-« ects have included renovations to biomedical engineering and electrical engineering teaching labs, the creation of an ' electron microscopy labora- . tory, and the creation of 8,400 square feet of faculty office space, conference rooms, and i open areas for research collaboration and meetings for the Data Science Institute. SEAS has also been. allot- . ted a plotof land on the new . Manhattanville campus. “She has the passion to crev ate not only physical space that satisfies ‘faculty need, but . she thinks about ‘how do we, make it long term and beneﬁcial and sustainable and efﬁcient,”’ SEAS Senior Executive Vice Dean Shih-Fu Chang said. “When you. create a space, it makes sense to invest a little more today so you can later on use this infrastructure.” . The investments in creating laboratory and ofﬁce space have also facilitated an increase in faculty hires—-22 new faculty members have joined SEAS in .i the past year‘ alone: ' '1 ""“lsean""B""oyee has».deﬁnite'ly~ made hiring of world class faculty a priority}? Garud Iyengar, the chair of the industrial engineering and operations research department, wrote in an email, “lEOR has added four new faclrulty since she arrived on campus. This is approximately a 20 percent increase in the facultyS count. And we are looking to hire two more faculty members this year.” According to Kachani, the expansion in faculty hires is . indicative of the dynamic vision Boyce brought with her to ’ SEAS. . “She came and she said, ‘We’ have to be a lot more risk taking. So instead of growing modestly over many years, let’s make ‘bold movement of growing the school from _a faculty side, enhancing. our structure and we will ﬁgure it out,”’ Kachani said. “To be honest, previous deans would not have done what Mary has done. They would have done it at a slower pace.” A r MAKING ENGINEERING EXCITING A V ' For decades, aperception ex- . isted that SEAS did not receive the recognition it deserved . within the University, with former dean ZviGalil once de- A scribing it as an “adopted child.” “I think Columbia has taken. ' a very long time to recognize the‘ importance of an applied science component to a real university,” McCaughey said. “Now that’s totally gone.” . But even as thelschool has ireclleivedlgreater recognition, Boyce is still working to distinguish the school, emphasiz- . ing to both SEAS students and members of the University community that engineering is “an incredible ﬁeld to be in.” V . “We want to really celebrate the incredible projects students do as part of their curr_iculum and to really-open that up to the entire Columbia community to see what great things our students are doing,” Boyce said.‘ To fostenexcitement, Boyce revamped the annual schoolS wide senior design exposition that showcases the culmination of graduating seniors’ work. Once a series of small, informal "" departmental events, Boyce created a single school-wide event in Lerner‘ Hall to highlight the V ‘sen=_iors"" designs andlinvited the public to attend.‘ I “The expo was something we talked about off andlon for quite some time «but she re-A ally got behind it and made it happen,” Vallancourt said. “It serves the purpose of making engineering more obvious to the rest of the community. Withouther support, I don’t know that it would have happened.” i V For students like Robert Ying, SEAS ’l6 andia Spectator editorial board member, another key initiative Boyce led was r the creation of the Makerspace, 650 square feet of open lab space students can access to pursue independent research and projects. V “It’s very hard to make a value judgement that says, ‘ls it worth losing a classroom in exchange for having another open lab for students?’ But she made that value judgment, and I think it’s the right one,” Ying said. _“I haven’t seen the classr room crunch getting worse, and in exchange we have a space A that’s open on students’ sched- . ule. It’s had pretty much constant usage.” V . Ying also cited the Extreme ' Engineering series as an exV ample of Boyce’s work to bring engineering to the forefront of the university. The lecture _ series, which kicked off this September,.has brought NASA s engineers and arctic explorers to campus with the goal of exposing students to exciting and radical jobs irrengineering. »“It ‘Wasn’t just. engineering students——peopleicame because it was cool,” Ying said. “That’s the kind of thing that - excites people and I think that has helped, because engineering has often been forgotten on campus,” E T ‘ Professor of. profession- ' al practice in the mechanical engineering department and former astronaut. Mike Massimino, who has helped to lead Extreme Engineering, said that Boyce’s vision for the series mirrors her passion for engineering and ‘her larger vision for the school. a E “I think she has thisvision "" that engineering is supposed ‘ to be fun, it's supposed to be exciting,” ‘Massimino said. (“You probably didn't become . an engineer becausé""‘yoil'want to solve differential equations. You probably became an engi- V neer because you like building things or you took a robotics class——that’s what got you excited. And she understands V that.” . E‘ » .
