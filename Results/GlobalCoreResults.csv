0,Global Core,Staff Editorial Core of the Matter Updated Major Cultures fails to improve requirements,3 September 2008,"Core of the MatterUpdated Major Cultures fails to improve requirementsStudents returning to campus may have been surprised by the news that the Major Cultures portion of the Core Curriculum has been replaced by the new ""Global Core."" Featuring courses such as Asian Humanities, African Civilization, and Latin American Humanities, this requirement was developed to stress the comparative nature of cultural study. Yet this change is neither consequential enough to actually broaden students' cultural understanding nor a step in the right direction. The Committee on the Core Curriculum should rethink and revise this initiative. In an e-mail sent on Aug. 29, the Committee on the Core announced that a single list of Global Core courses would replace the three-tiered Major Cultures system. By eliminating the three lists, the committee has created a pool of classes that can be taken in any sequence. As it stands, the Global Core for the class of 2012 includes all existing List A courses, which are broadly introductory courses in a single civilization, as well as many from List B, which covers more specialized courses in these same civilizations, and List C, which addresses the manifestations of these civilizations in the United States. But the emphasis on List A classes does away with a system that moved students from broad to specific study within a culture. And while List B and C classescan be small seminars, List A courses are typically larger and considered by many students to be less instructive. Ironically, such survey courses seem to be the linchpin of the newly devised Global Core. At best, the change is purely superficial. The e-mail is quick to mention that the Committee on the Core changed the name of the program, but gives the impression it did litde else. Though the committee seems to have spent time on the language of the statement, the Global Core list includes no classes developed specifically for the requirement. At worst, the committee has done away with any guidance to direct cultural inquiry. In the past, List A courses served to provide a foundation more specialized study in Lists B and C. But the new requirement will destroy the incentive for students to study cultures in depth. According to the announcement, the Global Core was created ""after rwo years of discussing some of the concerns voiced by faculty, students and administrators."" Apparently, two years of dialogue have succeeded only in getdng rid of any guidelines with which to focus cultural study. The e-mail indicates that the changes to the course list will occur over ""the next several years."" For the sake of students who deserve more than a cursory overview of non-Western culture, these revisions should come as soon as possible."
1,Global Core,STUDENT,4 September 2008,"Step one to excelling at Columbia: plan ahead. Use your adviser, SSOL (Student Services Online, one-of the most useful acronyms on campus), and the online class directory to help you map out your course O.f study. Familiarize yourself with the requirements and idiosyncrasies of the Core Curriculum (check out the Bulletin for more information—yes, frustratingly enough, this is an entirely separate Web site from the Directory of Classes). It's especially important to figure out which courses you can take to kill two birds with one stone-pre-med requirements, for example, also fulfill your science Core requirement, and Global Core courses count as history classes. Once you've harnessed the Core, it's easy enough to be the most bookish student—that just requires a dedication to camping out in the University's libraries. No student camper would be prepared without a computer lock. Attach this device to your chair or your desk in Butler to ensure that no quick-handed visitor steals your laptop or your place. It also can't hurt to have some bookends to corral the manifold texts you'll want to collect from Columbia's awe-inspiring library system (we've got over 8 million books on the undergraduate campus alone). Just watch out for Avery—they don't let you check books out there, so you'll have to photocopy any information you may need for later. When studying in a library, don't go overboard like students at other Ivy League"

3,Global Core,Global Core: A First Step Toward Change?,9 September 2008,"BY SCOTT LEVI Spectator Staff WriterIt's understandable if you had to read the official announcement ushering in the new ""Global Core"" a few times before you could figure out what it meant. The newest tweak to the Columbia College Core Curriculum does not seem to depart much from the existing Major Cultures, though its proponents say that it is just the first step of a holistic makeover for the controversial Core requirement. The Global Core was unveiled in mid-August after years of discussion about what to do with Major Cultures, a relatively recent addition to the Core. Major Cultures was intended to offset the largely European curriculum offered in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, but has been criticized for being superficial. The critiques of Major Cultures came to a head during last fall's hunger strike, when protestors demanded that the University reform the requirement. As part of a settlement ending the hunger strike, Columbia comrn itted to converting Major Cultures classes to seminars. What the Global Core amounts to thus far is a consolidation of Major Cultures courses into one list. The Global Core will apply only to the class of 2012 and its successors, though continuing students can elect to pursue it in lieu of Major Cultures. Administrators of the Core say that it lays the groundwork for further reforms and has been a long time coming. ""The changes to the [Major Cultures] requirement —and really, the beginning of more formal discussions about the requirement — are the result of two years' work discussing the requirement with faculty and students,"" said Patricia Grieve, chair of the Committee on the Core and a professor of Spanish and comparative literature.Professors didn't keep quiet about their opinions of Major Cultures, either. ""From the very beginning, concerns expressed by faculty had to do with die structure and teaching of the courses,"" said Kathryn Yatrakis, dean of academic affairs at Columbia College. ""When the Global Core was approved ... it was clear they were so eager to start having a place in the curriculum."" ""The classes had no connection to one another and ranged from simple historical overviews to language classes,"" agreed Jes-sica-Becker, CC 10 and a student representative on the Committee on the Core. In an effort to resolve this disunity, the Global Core will shift to a single compilation of courses grouped by the department they come from rather than the breadth of material they cover. The language used in naming the Global Core reflects what many view as the increasing importance of global forces in shaping perceptions of culture. ""Comparative and interconnectedness are words we use a lot when talking about the Global Core,"" Grieve said, referring to the theme of integration the committee intends to make the epitome of the program. To communicate those messages in a uniform way, the average class may ultimately become a seminar. ""A seminar fosters conversation, allowing students to develop a more thematic understanding of the chosen cultures,"" Becker said. But that kind of structure still seems a long way away for the new requirement. ""That will take just a litde bit of time,"" said Yatrakis, who was unable to estimate exactly when the courses would become seminars. ""It has to do with expanding resources—space and faculty. If you're designing a course that is four 20-person seminars, more classrooms will be needed than for an 80-person lecture."" scott. levi @columbiaspectator. com"
4,Global Core,A Move in the Right Direction,10 September 2008,"BY AMIN GHADIMISo Earth's Major Cultures are now its Global Core. And this means what, exactly? I'm not sure. For me, one of the 1000-plus first years who face the new world of the Global Core and tray-free John Jay dinners, the Major Cultures component of the Core is just a piece of history, and the hunger strike that precipitated its demise is just a story on Bwog. 1 never dealt with three separate lists of acceptable Major Cultures courses. I didn't experience the hunger strike first-hand. And, quite frankly, I'm not sure I can explain what the difference is between Major Cultures and Global Core now that I must only concern myself with the latter. I'm just the callow, quixotic Lit Hum-er Columbia's seen too many times, one who is just getting to know what fueled the activism against Columbia's Major Cultures, one to whom Professor Patricia Grieves Aug. 29 letter about the Global Core seemed excitingly unfamiliar, and one who is still all too eager to explain why he believes he supports this latest amendment to the Core. From the untainted, untestefl perspective of this irreverent Terrible 12er, the entire Global Core debacle seems at once unnervingly strange and comfortably familiar, distinctly Columbian and insipidly commonplace. On a superficial level, terminology like ""List B courses"" and ""Global Core requirement"" feels foreign to me. What exactly are Lists B and C, and why don't they apply to me anymore? But at a more fundamental level, one beyond the punctilios, 1 think the basis for the argument over the Global Core is actually identical to that of an argument everyone on the pedagogical globe is having right now—or, at least, should be having. The accusation of the Spectators Editorial Board in ""Core of the Matter"" (Sept. 3) —namely that the Global Core is only ""superficial[ly]"" different from its predecessor's disgraceful ""cursory overview of non-Western culture""—is essentially the same accusation leveled against Advanced Placement and the International Baccalaureate from opposite sides of the Atlantic. One says the former is too ""American"" and the other accuses the latter of being too ""European,"" yet in the end neither organization offers a truly all-inclusive education despite their grandiosecurricula. It's also the same grudge China holds against Japan: that Japan's textbook writers are too nationalistic to acknowledge the atrocities their forefathers committed in WWII. And it's even the same type of imprecation hurled at both Barack Obama and Sarah Palin (whether justified or not) saying their views are too parochial or that the candidates themselves are too inexperienced. Suddenly hurled into a new school and a new city, I find myself comforted, even excited, to discover that even the most campus-centric arguments are the same as those playing out on the world's stage. But my reaction is actually more than just excitement —it's also-one of pride. The Global Core hoopla confirms to me that Columbia's desire for true education—an education in which we learn and value what we believe matters rather than what society expects us to —is real. Columbia philosophically understands what it means to truly educate, even if we can't agree on how the university approaches the pressing need for each person to have a global education. So to me, to someone who just got here, to someone who hasn't yet faced the disgruntle-merit and disappointment that inevitably come with four years at any school, this is what makes Columbia a singular educational institution. The Core—whether part of it goes by the neologism ""Global Core"" or by the more familiar ""Major Cultures"" —forces us to deal with worldly issues on a daily basis and compels us, with our distinctly Columbian rebelliousness, to challenge the very ideas that are supposedly taken axiomatically in our curriculum. Whether the move to ""Global Core"" is, as the Editorial Board says, ""no[t] a step in the right direction,"" is an essential question, one that absolutely must be addressed by faculty and students alike. However, it's not a question with which I am willing to grapple quite yet. All I know for now is that the mere existence of a requirement like this one, whatever name it assumes, is a move in the right direction—a direction that, unfortunately, not many people outside of Columbia can claim to have. And to have taken a first step in that direction is something for which I am truly thankful. The author is a Columbia College first-year."
5,Global Core,"Staff Editorial If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em",10 November 2008,"If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'EmIn the aftermath of last fall's hunger strike, the administration has paid greater attention to the ways that students can impact the Core and curricula across Columbia College. While there are several student positions on the Committees on the Core and on Instruction, the number of student applications for these positions is low. The Columbia College Student Council has taken strides to promote these committees to potential student applicants, but should'alsb iA'brk --to explain and enharrte the'tbles students in these groups serve in academic life. COI and COC are responsible for addressing Core issues, adding new courses, and changing degree requirements. By including student representatives in these groups, the administration gives the student body a chance to voice their opinions about CC's academic programs. Recently, however, these committees have drawn few student applicants and have faltered in providing students with a strong voice in the school's decision-making body. Only five students applied to the two committees last spring, prompting officials to establish an additional deadline this fall. Just nine more students applied. While students on COI and COC say their opinions are respected by administrators, they add that the slow process of curricular modification discourages students interested in change from applying for a position. CCSC is well-placed to better advertise student positions on these committees and maintain astronger voice in CC's academic life. Beyond sending e-mails, the council should hold information sessions to explain and emphasize the significance of these positions. Such presentations would reassure students afraid of being marginalized while serving alongside faculty members and explain in detail the purpose each committee serves in academic life. Indeed, the Committee on the Core's lone student representative was essential in making changes to Frontiers of Science and in the creation of the Global Core requirement, after corresp'onding with students and student groups. As a representative for College students, CCSC should serve as a channel of communication between the student body and student representatives on COI and COC. Though past student representatives have kept tabs on student opinion, COC and COI would better represent and respond to student's opinions with input from CCSC. Members of the student body for their part —especially those passionate about and critical of the Columbia curricula—should grab hold of these committees' potential and seriously consider applying. Student representatives on COI and COC are indispensible in keeping CC's curricula up to date, and their roles should not be taken lightly. Only with constant interaction between students and the Committees on the Core and on Instruction can we repair the type of disconnect that led to the hunger strike."
6,Global Core,The Value of Diversity for International Students,10 November 2008,"BY AMIN GHADIMIFor an international student like me, there is no place like Columbia. Harvard sits atop the U.S. News and World Report rankings, Georgetown has an impressive international relations program, and Oxbridge costs significantly less than 50,000 dollars a year, but none of that really matters. With its pedagogical philosophy and its approach to the concept of education, Columbia offers a truly singular international education. We all know that Columbia values diversity. We experience it for the first time during NSOP week. We see it on College Walk. We hear it in our Core class discussions. We deal with it so much that it may even become banal to us. But it is perhaps only the international student who, because of his or her ostensible foreignness, appreciates how important this diversity is. Internationals are often told about the difficulties of adjusting to a new school and a new country at the same time. Before sending its students abroad, my high school in Japan organized a ""senior transition meeting"" in which it warned seniors of the potential culture shock we would experience in a new country. During NSOP week, I joined my fellow international students in a meeting that exposed us to the different climate of ""the American classroom."" Though certainly helpful, both meetings were superfluous. Columbia's commitment to diversity offers everyone, including me, a comfort zone and a place to feel at home—but not a crevice in which to hide from exposure to different and even conflicting and provocative viewpoints. For me, Columbia's dedication to diversity speaks to my religious identity as a member of the Bahai Faith. On April 12, 1912, Columbia University opened Earl Hall to the Son of the Founder of my religion. He delivered a speech in which he addresseda common element of Columbian philosophy and my faith: he said, ""It is our duty to put forth our greatest efforts and summon our energies from all directions in order that the bonds of unity and accord may be established among mankind."" Columbia demonstrated a commitment to diversity almost a century ago in giving one of the central figures of the Bahai Faith a platform to speak from, and this commitment still resonates; in last year's World Leaders Forum, President Bollinger raised the question of the persecution of Baha'is in Iran in his address to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It is at Columbia that I find my religious beliefs acknowledged and respected. With such a commitment to diversity here, assimilation is not difficult—in fact, there really is no need to assimilate. At the same time, and perhaps more importantly, Columbia's diversity provokes just as it welcomes. Last week, President Bollinger welcomed Sir Salman Rushdie to the inauguration of the Institute of Religion, Culture, and Public Life at Columbia. Last year, to the World Leaders Forum on the same campus, he welcomed President Ahmadinejad, who represents a regime that seeks to put Sir Rushdie to death. Does diversity then become a self-contradiction —can we, for the sake of diversity, paradoxically tolerate those who cannot tolerate diversity? What does this mean for an international student who may bring with him or her ideas and beliefs that conflict with those prevalent at Columbia? How do we reconcile the contradictions diversity engenders? I feel that Columbia seeks to answer these questions —or rather, to force us to answer these questions —in part through the Core Curriculum. Frontiers of Science seeks to train us to think rationally and scientifically, while Art Humanities makes us look at the world from a diametrical perspective. Literature Humanities is steeped in Western culture, while the Global Core seeks to compensate for that. It is asif Columbia's emphasis on diversity of thought and analysis of different points of view is tailored for international students. Columbia teaches us how to synthesize the different cultures and ideas we were exposed to in our upbringing, thereby reconciling them. In this way, I believe that internationals almost viscerally feel the importance of having this exposure to diversity—it speaks to a central part of our identity to think about education as a means of appreciating and solving the question of diversity. It is true that Columbia is, in all its racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural heterogeneity, a microcosm of New York City and of the United States. The diversity we encounter in the city complements and enhances that we experience on campus, while the election of Senator Obama to the Presidency makes any talk of the importance of diversity to the identity of America entirely redundant. But to dismiss Columbia's diversity simply as a reflection of its surrounding culture is to fail to give the University adequate credit. The creation, maintenance, and fostering of the diversity on which we pride ourselves is difficult and controversial, but for the international student especially, that commitment to diversity is invaluable. That Columbia respects diversity but is never afraid to question and challenge it makes it a global leader in international education and the obvious choice for internationals thinking about which college to attend. Any international student can probably attest to being stalked and spammed in high school by admissions officers preaching about how they seek to diversify their campuses—something Columbia has already done and continues to do. This commitment to an international student body is important, for it is from the style of education at Columbia that global solutions to the most pressing global questions emerge.

7,Global Core,Ch-ch-changes,13 November 2008,"This week, The Eye's lead story examines the issues of race and ethnicity at Columbia through five students' personal experiences. For reference, here's a collapsed timeline of racially"" charged incidents at the University over the past 40 years, compiled by Oriana Magnera. 1968: Students protest the construction of a new gymnasium over Morningside Park that would have separate entrances for Morningside Heights residents and Columbia students. White protestors are asked by black protestors to take over their own building. 1992: Students protest the Eurocentric nature of the Core and call for a newer, more global set of requirements. The Core is changed to incorporate new requirements that were, until recently, known as the Major Cultures component. 1996: Students go on a hunger strike for the creation and funding of an ethnic studies department. 1999: The Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race is established. 2005: An ad-hoc committee is established to review the department of Middle East and Asian languages and cultures after students complain of intimidation and anti-Israeli bias in classroom discussions. Spring, 2006: Two students vandalize a Ruggles suite, drawing swastikas on the walls and writing racist and anti-Semitic slurs; homophobic graffiti is found on an RA's door. In response to both incidents, a group of students organize as Stop Hate on Columbia's Campus and hold silent protests on the Low steps. Fall, 2006: Jim Gilchrist is invited to campus by the Columbia University College Republicans. To protest his appearance, a group of students rush the stage. Fall, 2007: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is invited to speak on campus. His appearance sparks concerns about both anti-Semitic-and anti-Muslim sentiment on campus, already stirred by the tenure reviews of professors Nadia Abu f l-Haj and Joseph Massad. Racial slurs are found graffitied in a SIPA bathroom. A noose is found on the door of Teachers College professor Madonna Constantine, and the incident is deemed a hate crime. Anti-Semitic graffiti is found in a Lewisohn bathroom. In protest of the recent bias incidents, Manhattanville expansion, decades-long tensions surrounding recognition of CSER, and the Major Cultures requirement, six students hunger-strike-the University agrees to some of the demands,-most notably a reorganization of the Core. December, 2007: The New York City Council approves the 'University's plan for a $7 billion expansion into the Manhattanville neighborhood-students and residents protest what they perceive as inevitable ""gentrification"" and the displacement of neighborhood residents. Fall, 2008: The Office of the Core unveils new Major Cultures requirements, now renamed the Global Core Requirement, which include a focus on issues of transnationalism, race, and ethnicity. CSER unveils a new, more structured curriculum, a Native American Studies major, and begins a student-led hiring process. Barack Obama, CC 'B3, is elected the first AfricanAmerican president and is the first Columbia graduate to reach the Oval Office."
8,Global Core,The Classical Language Requirement,22 January 2009,"BY JAKE MILLERWhat was once traditional has now become a radical proposition: that Columbia College students be required to take Latin or ancient Greek, rather than a modern language. Yet there are good reasons for such a requirement: Studying a classical language improves verbal skills and introduces students to other cultures more effectively than studying a modern language. Because of the formalized study of grammar they entail, classical language courses improve verbal and analytical skills in a way that modern language courses do not. Classics majors have higher combined Graduate Record Examination scores than virtually any other students, including modern language majors. Of course, because of the third variable here—the self-selection bias—that statistic is irrelevant. However, it is surely relevant that the combined GRE scores of classics majors showed a drop at about the same time that classics programs began de-emphasizing the languages and teaching more civilization courses. This indicates a relationship between the verbal and analytical skills tested by the GRE and experience in the classical languages. These skills are most likely affected by the close analytical work required by the intensive study of grammar. As a student of French, Latin, and Greek, I can testify to die fact that the level of analytical and grammatical work I do in French is not comparable to the work I do in Latin or Greek Nor could it be—most modern languages have much simpler grammars than Latin or Greek,and in any case, the emphasis in modern language courses is on communication, not on the formal study of grammar. Once the grammars have been mastered, the focus of classical language courses is purely literary. As a result, studying a classical language teaches students more about other cultures. For example, a two-year course in Greek might consist of two semesters of Greek grammar, and then a semester each of reading Plato and Homer. While the student of German is learning how to older a sandwich, his counterpart in Greek is reading the Republic. This more literary approach certainly pays off when it comes to appreciating the cultures of Greece and Rome. Finally, learning a classical language would enrich discussion in both Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Imagine if students could refer to the literary features of the original Greek text of Medea. No language is as represented in Literature Humanities as Greek is, or in CC as Latin is, and even those texts that weren't originally in Greek or Latin often refer extensively to the classical texts to which students would be exposed in their language courses. I realize that the Core is already criticized for its Western focus, and the foreign language requirement could be seen as an opportunity to pursue the study of another culture. However, judging by enrollment numbers, most students are pursuing European languages anyway. Further, it is highly questionable whether one learns much culture in an elementary Arabic course, when the primary focus of the course is linguistic. Finally, there already is a part of the Core devoted to non-Western cultures: the Global Core. If the Global Core is insufficient for that purpose, then that is a problem widi the Global Core. There is no reason to force the language requirement to serve the same purpose. Such a complaint would merely be specious: although it is true that Greek and Roman cultures contributed mightily to the foundauons of Western cultures, their attitudes toward gender, politics, andreligion were strikingly different from those ofWestern cultures of today. They were not even confined physically to the West: Roman lands included parts of North Africa. Indeed, it would be hard to find a modern society more ""foreign"" than either Greece or Rome. America arguably has more in common with modem Japan than with Sparta. ""The study of the classical languages actually exposes students to cultures that are in many ways more different from our own than another modern culture. Some might say that with increased globalization, it is essential that students be able to speak the language of another country. Knowledge of a classical language actually facilitates learning a modern language, more so than a modern language does for another modern language. Because the Latin and Greek grammars are so complex, in order to learn a modern language, it is usually just a question of what to subtract from the Latin or Greek grammar already mastered. Moreover, the level of a modern language attained after two years at Columbia is generally not high enough to permit students to immediately live or work abroad without further instruction in that language. Students who are interested in doing so have to take extra language courses anyway. In addition, utility cannot be the standard by which Core requirements are judged. Almost any discipline could benefit the modern student in some way, but it is unrealistic to include every useful skill in the Core—and as already shown, classical languages are themselves useful to know. I am not suggesting that we add a requirement, but rather modify an existing one to improve it. The study of classical languages has been in decline for a while now. Indeed, very few high schools teach them. College will likely be the only opportunity students ever have to engage with classical languages, whereas modem languages are widely taught even at the middle school level. We should be continuing this educational tradition, not allowing it to die without comment. The author is a Columbia College sophomore."
9,Global Core,Shirking professorial responsibility,1 April 2009,"BY DOV FRIEDMANWhen The Current hosted professors Mark Lilla, professor of humanities, and Mark Carnes, Ann Whitney Olin professor of history at Barnard, for a panel discussion, the ostensible topic was the Core Curriculum. Campus-wide debate and criticism of the Core are as much a hallmark of a Columbia education as the courses themselves. Yet the discussion between Lilla and Carnes yielded insight into something arguably more interesting than the Core itself: the responsibilities of professors as educators. Carnes explains his development of a new approach to teaching as something like an epiphany. While teaching Contemporary Civilization, he realized that its methodology was misguided. Carnes used Plato's The Republic to explain the flaw in the Socratic method. As the dialogue progresses, Socrates speaks more, while the students speak less. Pedagogically, there is something wrong with the passivity of students. Carnesspent years developing his Reacting to the Past curriculum, which uses elaborate game formats in which students take on roles as historical characters to radically alter the student classroom experience. Lilla's philosophy of teaching, however, seems opposed to Carnes's. Lilla argues that American teenagers come to college less educated than our international peers. It is his responsibility to steep Literature Humanities students in the intellectual tradition. He challenges his class and raises the bar of his expectations. In his model, the professor instructs from a position of knowledge, hoping to instill questioning and understanding in students. Lilla and Carnes have differentpedagogical approaches, yet as educators these men are strikingly similar. The idea that emerged most clearly from their discussion was a mutual passion for teaching and a willingness to go to great lengths to effect intellectual growth in their students. Carnes is leading a movement to incorporate Reacting-style teaching at other colleges. Lilla reads and comments on two-dozen multi-page reading responses for every class. In different ways, these professors provoke a reconsideration of professors' roles at the University. Carnes and Lilla both stressed the energy they have expended in creating a rigorous classroom experience. Both indicated that their efforts were worth the extra work, because the student response speaks for itself. The contrast between Lilla and Carnes on the one hand, and many experienced professors on the other, ispainfully clear. Lilla and Carnes reiterated a common criticism of the University: many academics are chiefly concerned with their research and care little for their teaching responsibilities. Undoubtedly, every Columbia student has felt this way about a professor in the past or will feel this way before he or she dons cap and gown. I have my own experiences. This past semester, I enrolled in a Global Core course with a prominent professor whose reputation as a lecturer was only outdone by his prowess as a writer. His writing captivated me, and when world news intersected with his area of study, I contacted him. I explained that I was looking to better understand the news that the media covered poorly. A simple book recommendation would have sufficed, yet this professor did not even acknowledge the e-mail. Is this how I, as a senior, am to remember Columbia? Is this a reflection of how Columbia wants to be perceived as an institution? When the pursuit of extracurricular education is stymied by professorial neglect, it is true irony: the person who has devoted him or herself to a life pursuing knowledge cares not to help students pursue the same. Columbia promotes the Core to prospective students as an opening of the mind—a chance for the entire college to have a shared intellectual experience that is the subject of passionate discussion on the steps of Low Library. We the students should know: the school was pitched to all of us once upon a time. The luster of this idealistic image—this marketing tool—is tarnished for everyone at some point. One way to conclude would be to propose policy changes in hopes that future students would have a different experience. Fine-tune the tenure process to incorporate professors' abilities to critically engage students. Provide incentives for experienced professors to teach Core courses, especially Lit Hum and CC. Finally, change the culture of this university. Promote a culture in which professors are eager to engage students outside of class and to cultivate their intellectual growth. Columbia is a fragmented, isolated place. Students are not alone in that feeling. When Lilla arrived at the panel, it became clear that in his three years here, he and Carnes had never met, despite both professors' prominence. Policy proposals from an outgoing senior are as valuable as the legislative priorities of a lame-duck president. Thus, the proper conclusion is an appeal to conscience. If the University stands for anything, it is the promotion of intellectual discourse and scholarly knowledge. Columbia has a responsibility to nurture its students' academic growth. Some of the best minds in the world are gathered together here in a startlingly small geographic space. It is time we start treating our intimate space like an intimate community as well.

10,Global Core,Staff Editorial Core incorporation,6 April 2009,"Core incorporationWhen Columbia College underclassmen begin registering for their fall classes in two weeks, the Core Curriculum will be on their minds. Despite the college's past efforts, students often feel that administrators ignore them when they attempt to critique the Core. University leaders must make an effort to take students' criticism more seriously. The Core is posited as the foundation of an undergraduate education at the college, with the goal of allowing students t!o pursue an in-depth liberal- 1 arts education in the midst of a large research university. Since its inception nearly a century ago, the Core has expanded and been significantly revised. Indeed, two of the most recent additions, Frontiers of Science and the Global Core, are currently under active review. The University has held several town-hall meetings in order to ascertain undergraduates' opinions regarding the Core. However, because of the inherently public nature of the gatherings, many students may feel intimidated about voicing strong opinions. There is often little concrete feedback on whether students' suggestions are being considered. As a result, students are dissuaded from attending or participating in the sessions. The University should give students better means by which to privately give their opinions of the Core to college officials.Of course, some aspects of the Core—such as its finances—should be left primarily to the discretion of administrators. Still, student contributions should not be restricted to those few brave souls who do not mind publicly expressing their views. Nor should students feel forced to turn to such measures as hungerstriking or seizing administrative offices. Columbia should introduce online methods for students to convey their views, such as standardized forms on Course Works Web pages that are'available throughout the eritife'Serhester. A written evaluation is less daunting than speaking in front of a crowd of administrators. Administrators should also make sure to follow up on comments they receive from students. These small steps could help inform various administrative decisions regarding the availability of Core classes or the direction in which these classes are taken. Because they deal with it nearly every day, Columbia College students are perfectly poised to assess how well the Core Curriculum is working, and each of them should be afforded the opportunity to privately let administrators know what they think. University officials should seek student input, and opening more channels of communication between the administration and the student body is necessary if he Core is to continue to evolve and better fit students' needs."
11,Global Core,A global guise,9 April 2009,"BY JAKE MILLERLet us presume—let us be uncontroversial—that it is valuable to study foreign cultures, that it is a worthwhile pursuit—for this is the premise that lies behind our Global Core requirement.

Where we wanted guidance, we find only a platitude—for almost every area in the entire world is not the ""primary focus"" of either Lit Hum or CC. What does it even mean to be the ""primary focus"" of Lit Hum or CC? Should we consider Spain an area of primary focus? Or Russia, with only Dostoevsky on the syllabus? What of those areas that are not covered at all—Poland, Canada, Ireland? No one could argue that those areas are the ""primary focus"" of Lit Hum or CC—yet we all know that a course on Irish literature or on Polish cinema would never be approved. But why? On what grounds, considering the text of the requirement, could such courses be disqualified?If we look at the list of approved courses, we will only find a few areas represented— East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and selected African and South Asian countries. Almost no other areas are represented on our list. And how have they arrived at this list? What secret criteria—for their criteria are certainly not evident from the text of the requirement —have they used to select these areas? One must see in this list an implicit ""area hierarchy""; their premise, evidently, is not —as I mistakenly stated above—that it is valuable to study foreign cultures, but rather that it is valuable to study these specific foreign cultures. Why these ones? The bulletin gives us no clue. Perhaps they are concerned that to reveal explicitly this hierarchy—as was the case in the Major Cultures requirement—would smack of illogicality. But it is no less illogical for being hidden—it is merely an illogicality forced underground. There is nothing in the text of the requirement that suggests such a hierarchy—which indisputably exists. I must pass over the other flaws and problems in the text of the requirement, although I would love to know what extent of space or duration of time qualifies as ""expansive"" enough. The list of approved courses provides no clear guidelines—it contains a course on Gandhi's India, a course on the U.S./Mexico border, and a course on popular music of the Caribbean, to name a few—courses which I would consider neither temporally nor spatially expansive. Instead, let us see how virtually any course that does not concern the few areas that can be legitimately considered the primary focus of Lit Hum or CC could fit this requirement.Take a random course from the catalog and test it against the requirement—a course which we all silently know would never be put on the approved list, because we all implicitly acknowledge the existence of the area hierarchy. Let us consider, for example, ""The Russian Short Story."" It passes the first test —Russia is certainly not the primary focus of Lit Hum or CC. The course is ""broadly introductory""—it is a ""survey of the Russian short story tradition""—and since it covers 200 years of Russian literature and involves the world's largest country, no doubt it is temporally and spatially expansive enough. It is ""organized around a set of primary texts"" and it ""focuses on a specific culture."" There is no reason, from the text of the requirement itself, why this course should not be on the list of approved courses. Try this experiment yourself—many courses lend themselves easily to the requirement. I am not objecting to the Global Core because I am Eurocentric, or indeed, for any political reason. I think foreign cultures ought to be studied. I am objecting to this requirement on the grounds that it is illogical, and that it is a monument to political correctness —an outdated view of the world as ""us"" and ""them,"" secretly enshrined in a list of approved courses that could not be independently derived from the text of the requirement itself. If the University wants us to take a course on these specific areas, then that desire should be made explicit—it should not be cloaked in the guise of a ""Global Core"" requirement. No one is deceived. The author is a Columbia College sophomore."
12,Global Core,Global Core to decrease class sizes Committee on Major Cultures discusses shift in lecture classes,15 April 2009,"Committee on Major Cultures discusses shift in lecture classesBY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Staff WriterA year after the creation of the Columbia College Global Core requirement, faculty members are evaluating potential classes and looking to downsize large lecture courses to smaller seminars—neither of which have been simple tasks. The Global Core requirement, which replaced the Major Cultures requirement in 2008—a less Western-centric curriculum was one of the demands of the hunger strikers last fall—is intended to ""address several world settings or cultures comparatively,"" according to the University Web site, Students will also have the option of taking classes about ""a specific culture or civilization, tracing its appearance and/or existence across a significant span of time and sometimes across more than one present-day country or region."" It is in the process of slowly shifting from large lecture courses to smaller seminars and increasing the number of Global Core courses offered. Patricia Grieve, the Nancy and Jeffrey Marcus Professor of the Humanities and the chair of the Committee on the Core and the Committee on Major Cultures, said that the process of evaluation for potential future Global Core courses has been ""both ... formal and informal."" Formally, she said, the Committee on Major Cultures, which oversees the Major Cultures requirement and will eventually become the Committee on the Global Core when the official curriculum change is fully implemented, will approve all courses for the College. But she added that ""informal discussions"" are also taking place among committee members, faculty, and students about the best way to pursue shaping the new requirements. Specifically, the committee speaks with faculty members in various departments to discuss courses they want to develop or that they think should bemoved from the Major Cultures list and placed into the Global Core. Presently, the classes of 2011 and above may still elect to fulfill the Major Cultures requirement, while the classes of 2012 and younger must complete the Global Core instead. Even though some of the Major Cultures List B and C classes—specialized courses on major civilizations and its manifestations in the United States of specific cultures—have been cut from Global Core, many of the List A courses, which are broader introductory classes, have carried over with the transition. But not all students have been enthusiastic about the transition from Major Cultures to Global Core. Louis Fisher, CC 'll, opted to stick with the Major Cultures requirement and took Theories of Culture: Middle East and South Asia and Colloquium on Major Texts: East Asia last semester. ""I had a really good experience in both of them,"" Fisher said. The committee wants student input, Grieve said. But she added that ""students have to show patience,"" and that there are ""good principles undergirding the thinking behind the Global Core."" Though there are srudents on the Committee on the Core, the Committee on Major Cultures solicits wider undergraduate opinions on thecourses. The students on the Committee on the Core, which oversees ail aspects of the Core Curriculum, held a town hall meeting to discuss the requirement last year. ""1 think Columbia's determination to make the Global Core into a more seminar-based requirement will only serve to benefit the students,"" Derek Turner, CC 'l2, said. He added that, from his experience with Literature Humanities, he has found that ""seminars are much better than lectures at engaging the students and making the topic much more personal and applicable."" But according to Grieve, the main problem has been finding faculty to teach the courses. ""Due to the current climate where many of the hirings have been frozen, we have to think very carefully about how we maintain the curriculum we want for our students,"" she said. And the floundering economy remains a hurdle. ""I don't think that the number of courses will be decreased but I do think that we may have to rethink the process by which we hope to incorporate even more seminars into the Global Core,"" she added. Presently, a new list of Global Core courses has not been posted for the 2009-2010 school year. The current list will remain in place for the 2009 fall semester. Grieve said that a new list will be posted - for the November registration for the spring of next year. , news@columbiaspectator.com"
13,Global Core,Staff Editorial Deans' list,4 May 2009,"Deans' listAs students gear up for another year at Columbia, the University welcomes two new undergraduate deans: Michele Moody-Adams of Columbia College and Feniosky PefiaMoraofthe School ofEngineering and Applied Science. Their arrival presents an opportunity to consider fresh ideas, re-examine ongoing projects, and renew Columbia's commitment to undergraduate education. Curriculum and academics The new deans should follow up on hiring two senior tenure-track professors for the Center for the Study ofEthnitity and Race. With two professors expected to leave the center next year, CSER must continue to provide richer and more advanced offerings. Administrators previously reported that Global Core classes will decrease in size to emulate other Core classes like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. The administration should apply the same rigorous standards of these Core classes to the Global Core, and do their best to move away from large lectures to ensure that Columbia becomes, in feet, a university committed to global-minded education. Health, wellness, and dining Dining must provide more convenient, time-efficient, and economical options. Meal plans and health services should collaborate to accommodate students with food restrictions, such as allergies. The off-campus Flex system must be more reliable and efficient to attract a greater number of off-campus establishments. Dining Services should increase the number of locations that accept meal swipes, such as Ferris Booth Commons, especially since first-year plans are mandatory and students cannot cancel meal plans after enrolling in them. The University alcohol policy should encourage responsible behavior reasonable for of-age students. Forbidding alcohol in the common areas ofsuites for legal students maylead to solitary, binge drinking rather than moderate, social drinking. The University must show that it trusts the judgement of its seniors at events that involve alcohol, treating them as the future professionals they are rather than people who need constant supervision. Research opportunities and expansion The construcdon of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center and nearcompletion of the Interdisciplinary Science Building bring a chance to establish Columbiaas the leader among research universities. Opportunities for undergraduate research should be increased, centralized, and better publicized. Administrators should grant undergraduates an active role in Manhattanville planning and space allocation, especially since today's students will be among the alumni the University will count on to fund the construction of the new campus. Student advising The administration has made strides in restructuring student advising, but the new deans must continue to review the advising process. To start, all advisers should be familiar with Core requirements. Major advising should be provided to students earlier, and all major advisers should be fluent in their respective majors' requirements. Columbia should also provide students with programming to increase their fluency in practical financial skills, which are more crucial considering the economy. A new academic year and new administrators bring tliepromiseofchange. Deans Moody-Adams and Pena-Mora will lace the challenge of balancing Columbia's bureaucratic structure and fiscal constraints with the University s reputation for academic excellence and a high quality of student life. Students, whether through student council, clubs, or media, along with alumni, must hold the new administrators accountable and make sure the University continues to move forward."
14,Global Core,"Academics expand with globalization, contract with budget cuts Global Core, Global Centers introduced in 08-09; due to large expense, Columbia slashes Ph.D. programs by 10 percent",11 May 2009,"Global Core, Global Centers introduced in 08-09; due to large expense, Columbia slashes Ph.D. programs by 10 percentBY SCOTT LEVI AND AMBER TUNNELL Columbia Daily SpectatorWhen Barnard history professor Owen Gutfreund, the popular, long-time director of the school's urban studies program, was denied tenure in December 2007, many students and faculty argued that he deserved better. But in fall 2008, Gutfreund received news suggesting his fate had been rewritten. Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation and Faculty of Arts and Sciences offered the specialist in urban history a joint appointment. Yet as proof of the blow the financial crisis has dealt the University, FAS announced this spring it could not afford to pay its half of the appointment. Instead, Gutfruend is slated to take a position at Hunter College of the City University of New York this fall. Gutfreund's story is not unique. Even as Columbia stays afloat in a market where universities flounder, financial concerns caused departures and prompted arrivals this year, and are now pervading the University's pursuit of its long-term academic goals. Some developments from the 2008-2009 school year, like the newfound autonomy of the School of International and Public Affairs, are not tied to the economic downturn. Others, including initiatives begun in previous years to globalize and refine bureaucracy, point to Columbia's constant awareness of the harm the current crisis is doing to higher education inside the gates and across the country. Making the cuts Data released this year suggests that as domestic and foreign financial troubles persist, students should expect to see fewer international and Ph.D. students on Columbia's campus next year. The American Language Program, whose English language instruction reaches vast South Korean, French, Chinese,.and Japanese populations in Columbia's undergraduate and graduate schools, received fewer applications. ""Economic changes and fluctuations in currency rates have had a significant impact on Asian clientele,"" Peter Awn, dean of theSchool of General Studies where the program is housed, said in February. According to Nicholas Dirks, vice president for arts and sciences, the University is admitting 10 percent fewer doctoral students due to the high costs of operating doctorate programs, and the diminished job market for aspiring professors. Going global Amid reductions in international students, the University has sought to expand its horizons in the world platform in other ways. In March, the Columbia Global Centers in Beijing and Amman, Jordan opened. They are meant to serve as research offices as opposed to the satellite campuses some peer institutions have opened. University President Lee Bollinger told Spectator in February that the research held at these centers aims to ""expand our global understanding and to make a contribution to the world but to do it in a way that's not local or regional, but linked globally."" Many view the openings as a tangible realization of Bollinger's, ""global university"" initiative. According to Kenneth Prewitt, professor of public affairs at Columbia and director of the Global Centers, by establishing the centers Columbia is taking connections it already has established around the world turning them into, ""a global network."" The bond between China and Columbia, for instance, goes back 100 years to an era in which Columbia became one of the first American schools to accept students from China. The University is just beginning its global expansion and hopes to ""cover every world region,"" including South Africa, South America, and Central Europe, according to Prewitt. He added that the next global centers will launch in India and Paris, the latter likely in conjunction with Columbia's Reid Hall for the study of French language and culture. While administrators traveled to Beijing for the opening in March, Barnard held its first ever symposium there, titled ""Women Changing China,"" featuring panelists such as English professor and women's advocate Wu Qing, novelist Geling Yan,Chinese-American filmmaker Ruby Yang, and media entrepreneur Yang Lan. This ties into Spar's mission to increase the international student population found at Barnard. Curricular reforms Undergraduate education received its dose of globalization as well. After last year's hunger strike demands capped an ongoing discussion about a change to the Major Cultures requirement, the Global Core premiered in mid-August to replace the old requirement. The Global Core was created to help solve the disunity of Major Cultures, which consisted of an array of courses ranging from broad introductory courses to language classes. The Global Core requires Columbia College students to take two courses from one vast list of courses, which predominantly deal with examin ing cultures comparatively or examining one civilization in depth across time. This requirement is different from Major Cultures, which had students choose two courses from three different lists of classes. Many introductory courses which previously counted toward Major Cultures courses have been adopted by the Global Core, while only some specialized courses carry over to new requirement. The Global Core aims to have students focus more on broad world cultures instead of only learning about one civilization. The focus on broad introductory courses has increased average class size for these courses by eliminating some of the smaller, specialized courses from the requirement. In the future, Patricia Grieve, humanities professor and chair of the Committee on the Core and the Committee on Major Cultures, said she hopes the Global Core will achieve ""parity with Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities"" in regard to academic rigor and seminar format. Presently, the class of 2011 and older classes may still elect to fulfill the Major Cultures requirement, while the. classes of 2012 and younger must complete the Global Core instead. Columbia is not the only one to have endeavored to make undergraduate education more relevant to the times. Barnard faculty is currently reviewing the Nine Waysof Knowing, Barnard's general education requirements, which have not been reviewed in depth in more than a decade. According to Muzna Ansari, representative to the Office of Academic Affairs and BC 'lO, professors have called several areas into question. One is the ""Reason and Value"" requirement —some, for example; want to ground it in more ""moral and ethical reasoning."" The courses that would fulfill this mandate would be more focused on urban studies and philosophy. Sorting out the Columbia bureaucracy Although the Faculty of Arts and Sciences responded to financial conditions by tightening its budget in a number of areas-, two major efforts to streamline contained no direct link to economic downturn. Administrators revealed plans this year to demystify the bureaucracy that supervises 29 departments—or 650 professors. A faculty-run review, begun in spring 2008 and brought to speed in the fall, seeks to address a culture of discontent among professors who express concerns that the labyrinth of governance committees decreases effective responses to their complaints. ""The faculty who have been involved for a long time largely agree that our current ... system relegates academic planning to a secondary role rather than a primary role, and leaves the faculty out of decision-mak-ing,"" astronomy department chair David Helfand said in an interview in January. The current review seeks to make more effective use of the tangle of committees whose advisory status and lack of mutual communication has diminished faculty participation. The Executive Committee of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, which is conducting the review, exemplifies the way governance has historically disheartened faculty, recycling a small group of unusually dedicated professors. Complaints range from minor inconveniences with faculty ID cards to administrative neglect to update professors on office relocation. ""Ultimately, the idea is to make people realize that the faculty committeesdo do important work, and that more people should volunteer to be involved,"" Dirks said in January. ""It has to be a broader group."" As the committee considers alternative models—including one that filters all proposals through a central body of faculty representatives—it is unclear whether major changes will be made to FAS's decentralized budget. On the other hand, Dirks' office, which currently chooses how to allocate SIPA's funds, is to hand that responsibility over to the SIPA administration in the fall. As 27 professors in SIPA are jointly appointed with other departments, SIPA dean John Coatsworth has said that freeing up the budget will increase transparency for donors while upholding significant curricular and research links. This comes at a time when SIPA revamps its degree programs, reducing the number of concentrations and offering regional specializations for students. ""SIPA will maintain close ties to the Arts and Sciences, but will have the financial and academic independence to develop in new and exciting ways,"" Coatsworth wrote in.an e-mail to SIPA faculty in March. Even so, SIPA is grappling with the issue of University expansion. Though administrators have stated that SIPA will resettle in a building on the Manhattanville campus in 2015, jointly appointed political Science and economics professors are torn between staying in their Morningside home departments and accompanying SIPA uptown. ""The links between political science, economics, and SIPA are very, very deep,"" political science professor Robert Jervis, who teaches at SIPA, said in April. ""If econ and poli sci do move, that will, over the long run, change the intellectual nature of SIPA."" His colleague, political science chair John Huber, has voiced his fear that a spatial disconnect could force SIPA to build its own specialized faculty. No formal decisions have been made about office movement. In an interview in April, Coatsworth said that ""over the course of the next 12 months, we'll know a lot more than we know now."" news@columbiaspectator. com"
15,Global Core,How to survive—and love—the Core Curriculum,1 September 2009,"BY SCOTT LEVI Spectator Senior Staff WriterDespite the excitement you expressed about the Core Curriculum in your winning Columbia application, the titanic reading lists and unending calls for discussion posts and papers may force you to question the Core's purpose at times. The subject of constant philosophical and pedagogical debate, the Core unites students in Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and define the University's undergraduate mission of cultivating critical thinking. Amid the myriad Core experiences, one thing remains clear: Everyone discovers at least one aspect that stretches his cultural knowledge, productively contextualizes her political views, or exposes his previously unknown love for classical literature. Here are some universal maxims (Kant, anyone?) to assist in the odyssey before you: 1. No one demographic of instructors teaches the Core best. The Core pushes you to shed preconceived notions, and you will do just thatupon realizing that your doctoral student instructor leads as fantastic a section as that of his famed dissertation adviser. 2. An instructor's status does not directly determine his competence. Some theoretical linguists could illuminate Greek philosophy, but not all literary critics can teach you Renaissance poetry. For seminar-style courses, use CULPA.info (Columbia Underground Listing of Professor Ability) to consider the most important variables in an instructor: time to commit to students, scholarly background, and workload. 3. Sit down with your CC or Lit Hum professor before writing a substantial essay. Refine your ideas with your instructor in advance. This shows that you care and can also result in a more insightful paper and a better grade. 4. Exploit the valuable foreign language requirement. Language is the quickest route to culture—a foundational goal of the Core—and proficiency in another tongue serves as a marketable skill. Study for tests, do all the homework assignments, and enroll in a counterpart two-credit conversation course where available.5. For Global Core courses and courses satisfying the science requirement, choose classes that contribute toward your major or track. Seek feedback on CULPA before you enroll. If you go in without a dedicated passion, immerse yourself in diverse subjects you would not research otherwise. 6. Read selectively. As instructors admit, not everything can or should be read, and certain sections of text provide greater understanding than others. While some texts' meatiest selections appear logically, others pose challenges to locating these selections. Since annotating will facilitate your exam reviews and clarify confusing passages, always have a pencil handy. 7. Do not be surprised if Core classes consume more time than courses foryour major. Some weeks, you may feel like you are majoring in Lit Hum or Gateway. The task of rewriting parts of a University Writing paper can last an entire day of your weekend. For the Lit Hum final, rely on class notes, the texts, and online guides; for CC, meet up with classmates to work through the ideas discussed in section."
16,Global Core,Staff Editorial Better late than never,23 September 2009,"Better late than neverUntil recently, Native American studies has been a field that has garnered little interest at Columbia. But things have changed: The Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race is aiming to create a Native American studies major or concentration by 2010. The development of this field at Columbia is an exciting opportunity for both the University and its students to take leadership in an often-neglected field. To ensure the success of this program, CSER should work to create a curriculum that offers a wide variety of classes. Then, in order to allow students of every concentration an opportunity to partake in this opportunity, the Office of the Core Curriculum should approve these new classes for the recently updated Global Core requirement. The approved Major Cultures course list, which applies to the classes of 2010 and 2011 and is currently being phased out, exemplifies the lack of attention to Native American studies in the past. While a wide variety of African and Asian Civilization courses were offered through Major Cultures, the Native American Civilization category boasted a laughable three courses. Fortunately, Columbia is work-ing to remedy this. Spurred on by student interest, the offices of the Vice Provost for Diversity as well as the CSER are working to hire new faculty and create more Native American studies courses. The program they envision will be particularly innovative because it will focus on the urban nature of contemporary Native American life and will also take an interdisciplinary approach to Native American studies. Students will be far more likely to declare a major or concentration if they feel that there will be plenty of courses and interesting options available to them. The University's efforts to improve Native American studies as well as its planned creation of a new major or concentration are commendable. Students would benefit from including Native American studies in their coursework, through either the Global Core requirement or electives. The Class of 2013 should also keep Native American studies in mind when selecting a major or concentration. We applaud the CSER for taking this important first step in promoting scholarship on this crucial field of study, and we look forward to further progress toward hopefully making Columbia a leader in Native American studies."
17,Global Core,ROSENTHAL: A LOOK BACK,24 September 2009,"interview by Raphael Pope-SussmanA professor looks back on four decades at Columbia,cover photo by Alyssa RappA PROFESSOR LOOKS BACK ON FOOR DECADES AT COLOMBIAINTERVIEW BY RAPHAEL POPE-SUSSMAN • PHOTOS BY ALYSSA RAPP AND COURTESY OF MICHAEL ROSENTHALPROFESSOR MICHAEL ROSENTHAL has spent more than four decades studying, teaching, and (in his words) ""deaning"" at Columbia. This fall marks the beginning of his final year here, as he will retire at the end of the spring semester. Rosenthal, who received his doctorate from Columbia in 1967, began his career as an instructor in the English department. From 1969 to 1971, he was an assistant professor. Then, in 1972, he left the classroom to become associate dean of Columbia College, a title he held for almost 20 years. In 1989, he returned to the English department. More recently, Rosenthal has served as the Roberta and William Campbell Professor in the Teaching of Literature Humanities. He also is the author of three books, the most recent of which, ""Nicholas Miraculous,"" is a biography of former Columbia President Nicholas Murray Butler. In an interview with The Eye in his book-filled office in Philosophy Hall, Rosenthal discusses 40 years of Columbia, his love for the Core Curriculum, and his ""deadly"" jump shot.Why spend your entire career at Columbia? The freedom of an urban environment is really what appeals to me. Although, because I grew up in New York, 1 didn't want to go to school here. But once I came back to graduate school, I began to feel this really was my mature home. And that's been wonderful. To me, a community that is entirely academic is suffocating, and so I delight in the fact that one has one's academic environment here, but then you go five blocks away and you're in another world. That, to me, is life-giving. I think Columbia is very much a life-giving place, which is why 1 find it so attractive. And why I think when it works for students—which it doesn't always do—but when it does, it really works in serious ways. I mean, you know, the best thing about having gone to Harvard is that one doesn't have to worry about not having gone to Harvard. I never found anyone—and this can't be true—but all the people I knew were not particularly shaped by Harvard in any sort of way. And that's not true of Columbia kids. I think Columbia students, because of the curriculum, because of the city or whatever, when it works on them it really does give them something, it turns them into something interesting. I don't think Harvard does that. You went from instructor to associate dean of Columbia College in four years, then later returned to the English department as a professor. Has what you've called this ""strange, backwards career"" affected your perspective on Columbia as an institution? Well, I think it did. First of all, I liked what I call my ""deanly life."" It's fascinating to see how institutions work, and where the power is and how one negotiates all these things. But since the normal trajectory is to teach, until somehow, your ambitions for a certain kind of power or your boredom of teaching leads you to become a dean, 1 think it's sort of life-giving to begin deaning and then to decide in a fully conscious way that what one would really like to do is to return to teaching and to writing and to being with students.So I think my returning to the classroom, having been a dean, was invaluable to me as a means of understanding what the institution is about. I think Columbia faculty tend to live really fairly particular lives in departments. Departments are really what run the institution, not the divisions. And so you only learn essentially the affairs of the department. ... You don't really have a sense of what the whole thing is doing. When I became a dean, I didn't know anything about the college. I knew about the English department. So learning about the college was extraordinary and then learning about the institution. So who knows how it in any particular way affected my teaching, but I think it gave me a perspective on the University that I like to think was useful to the students ... when I returned to teaching.How has Columbia changed in your time here? Clearly, the fundamental change was the admission of women, which turned the place entirely into a more interesting, vibrant, vital, funny, terrific place. And so half the students that were admitted almost immediately were women, and that clearly changed the whole ambience and nature of the place. People always ask me, ""Are the students now much smarter than the students were?"" Because now there are 25,000 people that apply, so they statistically have to be, and I say, ""No, they're really quite different."" But it's not clear to me, you know, they're more sophisticated, they're more affluent, they obviously have all sorts of skills dealing withtechnology. But they're not as committed to books as a means of understanding the world as they were when I hrst got here. And you can lament that, but I think that's just the reality of things. When I was first teaching, if one mentioned Philip Roth or Norman Mailer or whatever, there would be kids whose eyes would light up, who would have read them, or would go and read them. Now if you mention those things, people just look at you as if, ""Who are those people?"" With some exceptions, obviously. Book culture, which was really so much a part of the Columbia spirit, has diminished. Other things have taken their place. That, to me, is a huge change. Kids are much more affluent now. More kids from prep schools. That has both a good and a bad effect on the place. The whole nature of early decision has changed the profile of applicants, in ways that are not always salubrious. ... TTie downside of early decisionism is that people who know about early decision are people who tend to be more affluent, who don't need to weigh scholarship offers. And so it's a different profile of kids. And what the consequence is—though 1 think the University doesn't want to talk about it—that the financial aid bill is kept under control. Now, on the one hand, that's fine, because money is money. And you have to look to the budget. On the other hand, that's not so fine. So that's a concern. You're a big advocate of the Core Curriculum. What do you find so appealing about the Core? I think the curriculum of Columbia College is a big piece of what's great about Columbia College. To read Homer and to read Aeschylus and to read Dante and Boccaccio—these are major formative intellectual, and even emotional, experiences. So I think that Columbia students are extraordinarily lucky, although I'm told that not all Columbia students come here knowing there is a Core Curriculum, which I find astonishing. But assuming they have chosen to come here because of the Core Curriculum, 1 think it's a great choice, and I"
18,Global Core,Staff Editorial Journey to the Global Center of the Earth,29 January 2010,"Journey to the Global Center of the EarthSince its inception last March, Columbia's Global Center in Amman, Jordan, otherwise known as the Columbia University Middle East Research Center, has brought together architecture students from the United Arab Emirates and Israel, conducted a forensic preservation study, trained teachers in the region, welcomed scholars and fellows, and begun setting up institutes through Columbia's graduate programs. Established after the king and queen of Jordan offered a facility, the Global Center in Amman marks a tangible step from Columbia University in the City of New York to Columbia University of the Wider World. The need for global research centers —not to be viewed as branch campuses, since they fulfill researchdriven and region-specific roles—is predicated on the administration's realization that Columbia doesn't know enough about the world and that the world doesn't know enough about Columbia. While Morningside Heights may seem like the center of the universe to students on this campus, the Global Center is the product of rethinking what a global university actually looks like. Alma Mater and College Walk are planted on what is and will remain the, main campus, but the idea behind the establishment of satellites like the one in Jordan is that the University's mission can be extended, networks can be woven, regions can be better understood, and students from all over the globecan communicate and learn from one another. Also laudable is the reciprocal nature of the project. The administration is quite clearly there both to teach and to learn, both to network and to engage intellectually with experts in the region. Furthermore, although the research opportunities available in Amman are primarily for graduate students, the administration has not neglected to incorporate the undergraduate population. A nine-week Arabic immersion course will be offered at the Center, providing students with the opportunity to engage fully with both the language and the culture of their studies. The School of the Arts will offer a photography class. Perhaps most revolutionary, though, are the possibilities the administration hopes to realize regarding the Global Core, which—through multimedia distance learning technology—has the potential to offer classes taught both by professors here and faculty in Amman. Unfortunately, many undergraduates know little about the Center and the opportunities it offers, of which interested students can and should take advantage. The Global Center should be a resource for all Columbia students, but it only will be if the administration actively informs and involves its undergraduate population. Columbia is traveling across the globe. Administrators should be sure to bring students along for the voyage."

The University is also discussing possible centers in Africa, Central Asia, and Latin America. The centers are part of a large evolving University project to increase its presence abroad and launch new international research initiatives. Unlike other universities, these centers are not branch campuses for students, but are low-budget research sites that can provide internship or research opportunities for students. According to directors, it is a completely new global network model with no precedent, involving collaboration with already established regional institutes. Directors say that the centers, which together form a program unlike any other college international effort, will benefit the people in these countries while simultaneously helping students become more acquainted with the world. Teaching and learning in Amman Last year the royal family of Jordan invited the University to open a facility in Amman—the family specifically sought support in education reform. According to Safwan Masri, the director of the Amman Center —also called the MiddleEast Research Center—and an adjunct professor at the Columbia Business School, the royal family encouraged Columbia to expand its reform efforts. ""We thought bigger,"" Masri said, adding, ""We are not there to teach any more than we are to learn."" Masri said that the center has been working with Teachers College to educate abroad. ""We have trained more than 700 public school teachers in Jordan,"" he said, adding that this educational reform is occurring ""in one of the most important regions of the world."" According to the Center's website, this year 1,000 teachers are expected to participate in the educational programs, which were created by researchers from Teachers College and experts and teachers in Jordan. Graduate schools and local institutes have already taken an active role with this center. The School of Social Work has developed initiatives for long term social work in Jordan, and the School of Continuing Education will be hosting a summer program for high school students. A nine-week summer Arabic program, which is normally taught at the Morningside campus, will take place in Jordan this summer and will be taught by Columbia faculty. Masri also said that the center will have an ""Institute for Scholars"" that will host six fellows per year who can work on their own research at the center. According to the website, ""scholars will be chosen by a Columbia University selection committee and will include doctoral and post-doctoral candidates from any nation."" He anticipates that the center will have a greaterconnection to Morningside in the future—for example, with guest lectures in classes, especially Global Core classes, given by faculty in Amman through video-conferencing. Peter Awn, the dean of the School of General Studies and the director of the Middle East Institute, said, ""Jordan provides you with one of the few places you can get both Israelis and people working in the Arab world ... to assemble for some incredibly interesting exchanges."" Kenneth Prewitt, the vicepresident of the Global Centers and a professor at the School of International and Public Affairs, said that the Amman Center's success has much to do with the support of the Jordanian government. ""The Amman Center, with substantial help from the Jordanian government and the Jordanian royal family, occupies a very effective building,"" Prewitt said. Building in Beijing, with less funds The smaller Beijing Center was a more challenging endeavor for the University. Xiaobo Lii, the director of the Beijing Global Center and a professor of political science at Barnard College, said that the center only occupies a rented office and has a small staff. ""The Beijing Center ... doesn't have the benefit of such powerful assistance, and its programming has been more limited,"" Prewitt said. ""We're very pleased that we've raised enough funds to establish the center, to staff it, and to begin to do some program development,"" he added. Lii said that the Beijing Center has seen both graduate and undergraduate students from Columbia. ""We have had student interns (who were studying abroad in Beijing) in the office and expect to have more this coming year,"" Lu said in an email from Beijing, adding, ""We also have provided visiting students with help in local contacts, research, and job opportunities.""The Center helped set up Barnard's Visiting International Students Program in China and offered students pre-departure orientations. The Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (GSAPP) funds Studio X Beijing, which hosts events and exhibitions, including seminars and socials involving visiting Columbia students and faculty. ""GSAPP has used the Studio X to organize workshops on China urban development which drew experts from architecture, urban planning, sociology, political science, and arts. Faculty and students from both international and local universities as well as practitioners have participated in the seminars at the Studio X,"" Lii said. Expanding borders Next month, new centers in Mumbai and Paris will make their debut, extending Columbia's reach to South Asia and Europe for the first time. Nirupam Bajpai, an economist and the director of South Asian Programs for the Earth Institute, will be leading efforts to open the center in Mumbai. Furthermore, the already-established Reid Flail in Paris—where Columbia students study abroad—will be transformed into the European Global Center, which will have the interdisciplinary research opportunities that other international centers have. In Paris, the University is still looking for a director for the new center. While these centers are slated to open in the spring, there are many other international locations currently being discussed. Prewitt said that a Latin American center would probably open in Rio, while centers in Central Asia and Africa are also potentials. These, though, he said, are ""not as far along in the planning stage."" Participating from home Even though the Global Centers aredeveloped independently of the University's institutes — which are on-campus academic centers —some professors in Morningside say they are eager to participate. The Middle East Institute has already been collaborating with the Amman Center. Awn, the director, said they are currently in conversation about the ""ways we could work together, both in promoting undergraduate and graduate work in the field, and how we can engage more broadly the people in the Middle East."" Awn added that over the next year, the Institute will probably launch a lecture series of Columbia faculty in collaboration with the Amman Center. ""I think it [the Center] really will become an incredibly important complement to us,"" he said. ""Although the work of developing centers in Latin America was not initiated by the Institute, we are eager to collaborate,"" Pablo Piccato, the director of the Institute of Latin American Studies, said in an email. He added, ""The expertise of our affiliated faculty and their connections in Latin America will undoubtedly be useful as the process goes along."" ""The goal of the global centers is not only to expand regional studies ... but to bring the kind of broad, global research that characterizes the University as a whole, to spaces and collaborations in different areas of the world,"" he said. ""In that sense, the project is of interest for everyone at Columbia."" Defining the role of undergraduates While many of the graduate schools are already taking advantage of the centers, what remains less clear is what role the undergraduates schools will play. Columbia's Center for Career Education said that this is a key opportunity to expand, starting with Beijing. Lii said that CCE has helped establish summer internshipprograms for undergraduates. ""As Columbia's only official presence in Beijing, we expect to work with CCE more on the internship programs going forward,"" he said. ""Center for Career Education wants to have an intern program in every single center, so eventually we'll have intern programs all around the world,"" Prewitt said. Michele Moody-Adams, the dean of Columbia College, said that the College is ""looking into all the possibilities,"" including curricular, study abroad, and research opportunities at the centers. Kathryn Yatrakis, the dean of academic affairs, said that the Arabic language program was the first start for the College's involvement in the program. There are ""all kinds of opportunities for curricular development that specifically focus on the Global Core,"" MoodyAdams said, but emphasized, ""We are not quite clear on what they are yet."" ""We hope it will give us options that you will not find at other institutions that don't have those connections,"" she added. Barnard is also going to work closely with Columbiaon the larger endeavor. Barnard President Debora Spar plans to give three lectures in Jordan at the Amman center after a Dubai symposium. ""We are hoping that over time undergraduates do get more vigorously engaged with the Center by proposing some kinds of projects ... in collaboration with faculty. But it really is as much up to the undergraduates to percolate ideas as it is for the faculty to percolate ideas. The possibilities are endless,"" Awn said. Student response has been mixed. Sujin Lee, CC 'l3, said she could see these centers as a way to tackle larger global problems. ""I think ... we need to remember that we're all citizens of the same world,"" she said. Laurel Schandelmier, SEAS 13, said that it sounded like there could be some interesting opportunities for engineers specifically. ""It would be awesome to have the chance to go to another country to do field research as an undergraduate, especially because I'm a SEAS student and it is difficult right now to study abroad,"" she said. Others, though, said thatColumbia needs to first focus on its home turf. ""I've realized that even though we go to Columbia and we're in New York City, I feel like we're still in a bubble,"" Raeye Daniel, CC 'l3, said. Though she said she thinks the Global Centers are a good idea, she added, ""I think that before expanding and spreading around the world ... you should solidify your school's base. There are already issues with expanding here in New York. Take care of what's going on at home before you start opening centers elsewhere."" The global picture Nicholas Dirks, the vice president of arts and sciences, said in December that he believes the centers will ""create more synergy with the regional institutes [already established abroad] without being restricted by them."" ""We don't really expect the full benefit of the centers' initiatives to unfold until there's a whole network of them and you start doing programming that involves more than one or two of them at a time,"" Prewitt said of his larger goals to have cross-center interactions. Prewitt emphasized the uniqueness of what Columbia is planning. He said that no other university has a program covering seven or eight regions around the world, although some peers are branching out. The University of Chicago has a center in Paris, Harvard University has one in Latin America, and the University of Michigan is considering a center in China. Dirks agreed that ""Columbia has no precedent for this"" although some universities, such as New York University and Cornell University, have already set up collaborations in Dubai. ""We really do believe that global education is plural, because the real payoff is in the network,"" Prewitt added. For Awn, the model of branch campuses is relatively unsuccessful and archaic. ""I'm not convinced branch campuses do much of anything,"" Awn said, adding that the global center model is much more effective, utilizing regional collaboration abroad and maintaining the focus on the central campus. University Provost Claude Steele said, ""As time goes on, we will really want to take advantage of those opportunities [the Global Centers] academically. ... That will be our high priority as an institution."" Prewitt said that in the future, the centers could become a defining character of the University. ""I think there will come a time when undergraduates will apply to Columbia just because we have this network of centers,"" he said. news @columbiaspectator.com"
20,Global Core,IVORY TOWER OF BABEL,18 February 2010,"by Amin Ghadimicover illustration by Matteo MalinvernoA critical look at the language requirement,a critical look at the foreign language requirementby amin ghadimi illustrations by rebekah kim & daryl seitchikNo matter how you slice the Core, the language requirement is its largest component. Columbia College students race through the major works of Western literature in two semesters. They return the next year to survey Western philosophy from Plato to Woolf. Science awkwardly claims a year and a half of their time. Neither music nor art even merits a full year. And physical education feels like an afterthought. But foreign languages? They demand a full four semesters of concerted effort. And when you factor in the relative point values of different Core requirements, the weight assigned to the foreign language requirement becomes even greater: many introductory languagt courses are worth up to five points, demanding, at least in theory, almost twice the amount of work and dedication than demanded by a perfunctory, three-point Science for Non-Sci-entists lecture. Alas, there is no Language for Non-Linguists. Some Columbia College students are exempt from the requirement because of fluency in another language. Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science are altogether exempt. It's clear, nonetheless, that Columbia is serious about producing graduates who are multilingual. On a campus where everyone argues over everything, an impassioned debate over the foreign language requirement is conspicuously absent. If many students open fire on Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization for being Eurocentric, if some complain about University Writing and Frontiers of Science for being boring, if the rationale for a Core Curriculum itself comes under question, then the language requirement deserves a good dose of Columbia skepticism and argument. After all, there is much to be skeptical about, so much to argue over. Throughout the Sisyphean task of learning a language, how often do we consider why we are memorizing words and mastering sentence constructions? We may grumble about our choice of language in moments of frustration at 3:00 a.m., but how often do we genuinely second-guess our decisions? Paralyzed by Choice The existence of such a requirement brings to the forefront a looming decision: which languages do Columbia students choose to study? For many of us, it's not an easy choice. There is a troubling tension between what's useful and what's interesting, what's timeless and what's trendy, what's easy and what's daring. Before even the choice is made, explains professor Stephane Charitos, director of Columbia's Language Resource Center, there is the problem of limited knowledge. While Columbia students may think they're choose language based on preference, they may not have the necessary information to make a knowledgeable choice—that is, they may not know of the variety of language options Columbia offers. ""Students naturally gravitate toward a [certain] language department because they don't know any better,"" he says. Choosing between Columbia's 45 to 55 offered languages, the majority of which Charitos describes as ""less-commonly-known,"" is all too frequently not given the attention of, say, choosing a major. Many of these ""less-commonly-taught languages"" find a home in the Language Resource Center. Tucked away in a corner of the School of International and Public Affairs, the LRC, founded in 1998 with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, was inaugurated as a way to promote language studies at Columbia. Currently, the LRC offers undergraduates opportunities to learn several less-commonly-taught languages, including Punjabi, Bengali, and Hausa.""The LRC is a place where the languages are nurtured and gro'wn,"" he explains, describing it in a later correspondence as an ""incubator"" for languages. Vietnamese, for example, began as an LRC-sponsored language program, but as it grew and expanded, it was passed on to the East Asian languages and cultures department. The entire world, though, seems to run on a few core languages. The United Nations has only sixofficial languages, and the number of people who actually speak, say, Finnish, is negligible on a global scale. When this is the case, can anyone really blame students for choosing languages that actually have a significant place on the global stage? In this way, the domain of choosing which language to study is a battleground of pedagogical philosophies, personal passions, and national interests. And it's an important one. ""This is nota decision you make on Monday and, two years later, you change to another language. You need to think through why you're taking a language,"" Charitos says. So how to decide? For Mark Hay, a Columbia College sophomore, the choice to study Hindi-Urdu was as much a visceral choice as an intellectual one. ""I'm an Indophile,"" he says in an email interview. ""I love the culture, the politics fascinate me, my religious tradition of choice originates from the region, and the holy texts I read and ascribe to are related in script and in spirit and in basic structure to this language."" Hay's mantra for how to choose a language is simple: ""Follow your bliss. Find the culture and the poetry and the heritage that speaks to you and pursue it out of passion and pure love."" In the October 2009 edition of Columbia Political Review , Hay wrote a biting attack on the increasing popularity of Mandarin and Arabic at Columbia and in the world, describing the trend as ""silly."" He posed a question: ""Is language study worth it—the hours in class stumbling through strange sounds, squiggly lines, the painful dialogues on your imaginary Chinese dating life and Arabic cooking habits—just to be momentarily fashionable?"" It seems that the response at Columbia has been a resounding ""yes."" According to professor Lening Liu, director of Columbia's Chinese Language Program, Columbia is at the fore of the rise of Mandarin. In 2002, there were around 200 people studying Chinese at Columbia. This year, there are between 480 to 490, he said, around 35 of whom are studying classical Chinese. That's almost a 150 percent increase in under 10 years. Professor Liu brushes aside criticisms of the possible transience of the popularity of studying Chinese. ""These days it's very hard to get anything done without China's involvement or cooperation,"" he says, referring to China's role in international affairs.That students would study Chinese for its utility makes sense to him. ""We realized the trend and we started early,"" he boasts. Six years ago, with an eye toward the vocational advantages of Chinese proficiency, the Chinese department began to offer advanced students the chance to specialize in media Chinese, legal Chinese, or business Chinese. Working in conjunction with the Business, Law, and International Affairs schools, it developed curricula tailored to individual career needs, a decision in which Liu takes pride. He goes on to explain how Columbia was the first Ivy to offer Business Chinese, Legal Chinese and Media Chinese. Such ebbs and flows in language preference are inevitable. Charitos explains that even if some view Arabic and Chinese as passing trends rather than global mainstays, China's huge"
21,Global Core,"Global Core for our ""global community""",12 April 2010,"This Monday, Shock and Awe's Sarah Leonard and Kate Redburn present guest columnist Kassandra Lee on the important questions to consider when evaluating the objectives of the Global Core requirement. Yesterday, I attended a meeting about the Global Core sponsored by the Columbia College Student Council (our lovely student government). The.faculty members present were Roosevelt Montas, the director of the Center for the Core Curriculum, and Patricia Grieve, chair of the Committee on the Global Core. It was an opportunity for students to discuss concerns about the Global Core and understand the objectives from the designers of the requirement. One of the ways they imagine the Global Core moving forward is to have team-taught, interdisciplinary courses focused on primary texts, which would be more like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. But, of course, like everything at Columbia, the recent economic crisis has ""put a strain on resources"" across departments in the humanities and the social sciences. Professor Montas made a point that the Global Core represents two necessary aspects of an education that might be left out of the rest of the Core: exposure to other cultures and exposure to non-En-lightenment-based theoretical paradigms. Both faculty members seemed to hope that the Global Core would successfully explore both of these objectives. The other students present offered their views and experiences with the Global Core. Their opinions seemed to be mixed about almost all aspects of the requirement: should the classes be seminars or lectures? Should they rely on a great books model? One student even suggested that we have a ""Frontiers of Culture"" class similar to the design of Frontiers of Science. I asked a question about the focus on ""culture"" and the role of Columbia's Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race in the change from Major Cultures to Global Core. Grieve then asked which Global Core classes I had taken and asked a follow-up question about how I liked the class Introduction to Comparative Ethnic Studies, to which I replied that it was one of my favorite classes here. Grieve answered that if a class is about a group in* the United States or Europe (""Western"") that has enough maintenance of cultural ties with the ""parent,"" culture then it could be a Global Core class (Asian-American Literature would be an example). Another possibility would be that the Committee for the Global Core may ask a professor to add more books from underrepresented regionsto the syllabus if the class seems close to meeting the Global Core requirements. In this way, professors would have the opportunity to expand their interests as well. Overall, the faculty members were receptive and engaged with what the students had to say. So hopefully there will be more discussions about the Global Core and the Core in general in which students' opinions can be taken seriously. Personally, I worry about ""engagement with other cultures"" as the dominant raison-detre of the Global Core since it erases some of the other organizing factors of the CC/Lit Hum syllabus that aren't simply related to culture. One of the other students mentioned that the Global Core seems like a catch-all for all that is left out of the Core, and I think it's a tragedy to think that the only communities, people, and paradigms ignored by the CC/Lit Hum courses are those that originate in non-Western regions. If we simply look to engage with cultures that are ""non-West-ern,"" do we erase the existence of groups that have operated within ""Western"" paradigms? Is W.E.B. Dußois the only AfricanAmerican deemed worthy enough for the Core to care about? Did people who are not white nor male never ""contribute"" to ""our society""?This brings me to another point: how are the complex experiences of people and communities that operate and have operated in the West going to be included in the Core? The presentation of the Core is a political statement of what has been and must continue to be the important genealogies of culture, political theory, philosophy, and morals in the ""West."" The Global Core attempts to show what's going on in ""the rest of the world"" with ""other"" cultures, but what about the philosophy, political theory, music, and daily existences that challenge the very coherency of ""Western Civilization"" that the Core puts forth? Should we (or they) even be fighting for inclusion in the political statement the Core makes? This sort of approach could not be acted out through the inclusion of more texts but would precipitate a total revaluation and radical restructuring of our dearly beloved Core. When I used to work in the Alumni Calling Center, alumni always loved to hear about my encounters with Plato and Aristotle before deciding to whip out their credit cards to help donate to the school. These are the material incentives that demand that we maintain the ideological objectives of our Core Curriculum.

22,Global Core,How to survive the Core and enjoy it too,30 August 2010,"BY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Senior Staff WriterLove it or hate it, there's nothing in the Columbia experience that quite compares to the Core Curriculum. The Core unites students in Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science with a common learning experience, albeit one with endless reading lists and discussion posts. Whether you sleep with ""The Iliad"" under your pillow or have long since chucked it out the window, the Core defines the University's mission to cultivate critical thinking in undergraduates. Here are some universal maxims (Kant, anyone?) for making your way through: 1. Tailor the classes to your interests. In many courses, you can choose your own essay topics. Love Jane Austen but hate Virginia Woolf? If you go withwhat you like, you'll make even your least favorite Core class more palatable. 2. Instructors are key. A good one can make you love a course, while a bad one can have you running for the hills within a week. When possible, use CULPA (www.culpa.info) to pick the professors that are right for you. Remember, though, that different students look for different traits in professors—you might actually love a professor who got poor reviews on CULPA. Also keep in mind that a good instructor can come from anywhere: Your favorite teacher may end up being a graduate student, while the class taught by that award-winning professor might turn out to be a bust. Look at the amount of time they have for each of their students and how much they are willing to work with students, and don't make judgments solely based on a professor's field. Many Coreprofessors come from different departments. Even if your professor has only ever taught Italian, she could still be an insightful Literature Humanities professor. 3. Take Core classes that contribute to your major. A Global Core course or a class that fulfills the science requirement might force you to explore a different aspect of your major than you normally would have—and you have to graduate sometime, after all. 4. Read selectively. Even instructors will admit that you can't read everything, and certain portions of the texts provide greater insight than others. The Core is the one part of the curriculum that is uniquely, well, Columbian. Whatever you feel about it, know that every single student around you has to get through the Core for his or her diploma. It is the tie that binds us together as Columbia students."
23,Global Core,Unifying through diversity,14 October 2010,"BY ERICA KASSMANCommitment to diversity by studying and embracing other cultures is rapidly becoming imperative as our world adopts a more interconnected and international character. Here at Columbia, we pride ourselves on our diverse community: We have a ""Diversity"" link on our undergraduate admissions page, our student body has students from over 100 countries and all 50 states, and a quick glimpse at the admission statistics from 2014 reveals that 17 percent of the student body resides outside the U.S. Even the curriculum reflects an emphasis on diversity through the addition of the Global Core to the renowned Core Curriculum, not to mention the variety of study abroad opportunities available from the, you guessed it, ""Office of Global Programs."" But Core classes, language requirements, and study abroad are not always enough to truly gain a profound understanding of a different culture. For many students, continuation in a certain foreign language, in a certain culture, or in a certain study abroad program is simply not a viable option given the need to satisfy other requirements, not to mention the fact that the Global Core includes mainly ""non-western"" cultures, thereby leaving out a large chunk of our ""globe."" Furthermore, studying and embracing cultures should not be restricted tolearning in the classroom or being stuck in a museum. One example of students creating alternative ways and opportunities to learn more about a different culture through a variety of casual, dynamic, and influential activities is the French Cultural Society. Students endeavor to open their minds to other ways of thinking and living by exploring cultures from outside the United States. Thus, they empower themselves in our globalized world with undeniable proof of dedication to diversity that is applicable not in the classroom, but in life.The French Cultural Society is not alone in this mission. Students at Columbia have taken matters into their own hands and have established an array of culture clubs. We have 17 Asian groups, 13 Black/Latino clubs, and 12 European/Middle Eastern/American organizations. Many of these groups were created to enhance cultural understanding and to create stronger connections between the Columbia community and the cultural community at large. The French Cultural Society, for example, is open to all students who wish to embrace French culture: French food, French language, French cinema, French art, French literature, and everything French in between. The club strives to promote French culture and language to all,no matter what level of acquaintance one may already possess. Cafe conversation nights draw Francophones, students in all levels of French instruction, and most importantly, those who do not have time for a French class but wish to continue speaking and practicing the language. Monthly three-course French dinners, which focus on a particular region of France or the Francophone world, draw a variety of guests: those with enthusiasm for cooking, culture, food, and conversation. The EUROTRASH party each semester is an opportunity for the student body to enjoy a night of ""European Clubbing"" complete with the latest in French fashion and French music. The French Cultural Society—or as it likes to call itself, ""La French Cultural Society""—strives to bring a glimpse, a taste, and a snippet of French culture to our campus. The strongest evidence of our University's dedication to diversity is that the students come together to create programming to help share cultural aspects of various traditions with one another. Ultimately it is the responsibility of individuals to constantly explore other modes of thinking and living and to try to respect, understand, and accept that there is an infinite number of cultures—each culture with its own strengths, weaknesses, and beauty. By allowing our curiosities to reign free and by stretching our current boundaries beyond comfort zones, even in small ways, we participate in an ongoing globalization that has the potential to unite our world in ways never before imagined.

24,Global Core,OPINION,15 October 2010,
25,Global Core,The Global Core lacks substance,15 October 2010,"BY STEPHEN WULast week, I received a notice from the Committee for the Global Core that the coursework I had submitted to satisfy that requirement had been returned and denied. The underlying logic was that the courses were, amusingly enough, ""too Western."" At first, I was stunned that this committee could presume to delineate between sufficiently and insufficiently ""Western"" courses, until I realized that this was nothing more than a clever gambit to mask a more fundamental issue: that the Global Core is, at its heart, a deeply flawed profanation of an otherwise sterling Core Curriculum. To start, the supposition that anyone can find the sharp bounds of Western culture is just a little bit silly. Particularly in this age of globalization, the concept of the West as a concrete entity is becoming increasingly meaningless. Emerging nations have adopted and integrated components of traditionally Western society,blending them into a new hybrid that defies easy categorization. The Global Core itself struggles mightily with what constitutes an approved course, for a class can either be focused on a specified ""non-West-ern"" culture or be a comparative study. Those delineations break down in practice, though, as some cultures straddle the line between Western and non-Western or seem to wholly defy those prescriptions. Surely ""Latino History and Culture"" falls squarely within the West geographically, but perhaps not in ideology. How, though, does one characterize ""Asian-American History,"" which is, by definition, embedded within the American tradition? More and more, it is impossible to separate out threads of Western thought and influence from minority cultures simply as a logistical matter. More than these practical concerns, however, the intent of the Global Core is nothing less than anathema to the mission of a core curriculum. It violates the charge that all Columbia students read the same books at the same time, creating a unified and coherent intellectual atmosphere. The Core at its best seeks to offer a common understanding to all undergraduates by tackling the greatest questions of human civilization. It hopes to broaden the mind,eliminating parochialisms by inquiring about the most fundamental of concepts, from justice to truth to duty. It is in this vein, though, that the global requirements collide most fully with the mission of the core. These classes are, by nature, intensely narrow in scope and deal not with issues that confront all of human-ity, but only those of the Caribbean, or India, or Tibet. The genius of the real Core Curriculum is its stability and the timeless nature of its investigation. The Global Core's aim is to specialize, to focus, and to constrict. ""The Mongols in History"" can teach us little about the universal nature of man—it equips us only with knowledge about Mongols in history, which is of questionable import as a basis for expanding knowledge.In the end, there is no distinction between Scandinavian truth and Indonesian truth or Mexican truth. Plato on justice and Augustine on God are explorations that do not fluctuate with time or place—they remain the pillars of philosophical thought irrespective of the petty contemporary classifications in which the global requirements so lavishly indulge. To admit that, though, would be to concede that the Global Core falls dramatically out of line with asking about the collective character of the human person and to expose the Global Core as an insignificant specialty course lurking among intellectual giants. The Global Core, then, serves as little more than a politically correct submission to the trend of multiculturalism, a poor attempt to offer disparate points of view at the expense of coherent analyses of the baseline points of human thought. It may be a worthwhile pursuit for the specialist, but it is disingenuous to argue that the Global Core is consistent with the mission to expound on great questions. Only there do we find illumination, not in these thousand points of trivial light. The author is a Columbia College sophomore. He is a senior editor for the Helvidius Group.The Global Core serves as little more than a politically correct submission to the trend of multiculturalism."
26,Global Core,Global Core is part of the game plan,25 October 2010,"BY YANG HULast week, Stephen Wu (""The Global Core lacks substance,"" Oct. 14) and Grace Bickers (""What world is the Global Core Promoting,"" Spectrum, Oct. 17) laid a good beating on the Global Core, but they have it all wrong. To see why, put aside the Global Core for just a minute. If the work of Plato and Augustine ""remain the pillars of philosophical thought irrespective of the petty contemporary classifications"" as Wu claims, why then, I wonder, do we even bother with the ""Nicomachean Ethics,"" the ""Discourse on Method,"" and ""The Wealth of Nations,"" which would be, as per Wu, just sequels to ""The Republic""? Now that I have finished Contemporary Civilization, am I left up a creek with a load of deadweight in my boat from Aristotle, Descartes, Smith, and the rest of the gang that's done nothing new since Plato?Everyone can agree that the Core Curriculum's objective is to provoke thought about the questions that concern all of mankind. The disagreement now, it seems, lies in whether the Global Core aligns with or runs counter to this objective. Stephen argues that the Global Core is contrary to the Columbia ideal, wherein every student would speak a common, intellectual language. Whereas the Core traditionally encourages students to broaden their minds by emphasizing only ""the most fundamental of concepts,"" the Global Core component poses a non sequitur constraint of studying issues relevant to a particular portion of the human race. But this critique leaves little room for us to appreciate much beyond any small handful of representatives of ""the greatest questions of human civilization."" After all, our Contemporary Civilization authorswere primarily engaged in addressing issues particular to their times, not to catering to our interest in big questions. In Wu's case, Plato and Augustine won the draw and were mentioned in his op-ed. But should we discard the rest? A musician develops fluency in reading music by practicing a varied repertoire. An athlete develops overall dexterity by practicing a variety of ad hoc drills. Likewise, a student develops sensitivity to general questions from the urge to unite seemingly disjointed observations. We need this variety. I wonder how Wu could seriously ponder the ""collective character of the human person"" without first outlining the differences among individuals which make this a nontrivial topic. Besides criticizing the narrowness of the Global Core, Bickers takes broader issue with the appropriateness of cultural classification? I'm confused as to how she could agree that ""knowledge of 'non-Western' cultures is certainly an imperative part of our educational experience"" and simultaneously disapprove of using the same discriminative power that invokes ""non-Western cultures"" in order to avoid ""simplifying the world."" If the term we're using is ""simplify,"" then what we're actually discussing is the merit of an assumption. Which is the more naive assumption, exactly? That there are patterns worth summarizing in the features of various cultures around the world? Or that formalizing common traits between cultures is pretentious, if not intractable? By the way, one of these two is patently un-Core. It's not fair to indict the Global Core for distracting us from the goal of our Core education, especially with a tirade on classification and departmentalization. By erasing the lines of classification, we diminish the achievement of generalization. Let's not forget that in Contemporary Civilization, we earned our awareness of universal questions after we distilled the invariance from a hodgepodge of thoughts in the Western canon. The universality of Plato's and Augustine's thinking is retrospectively obvious, in the same way that a forest's being full of trees is obvious once you've see the forest. Our sense of the important questions of mankind would definitely benefit from the conditioning the Global Core offers, which challenges us to continue making connections, as we do in all Core classes, among any group of cultures in the world.

27,Global Core,"True globalization, true diversity",29 October 2010,"BY WILLIAM THEODORE DE BARYEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome.There has been much ado about globalization recently at Columbia, much of it focused on the Global Centers—with new ones likely to open in Paris and Mumbai this spring. Fortunately it has been accompanied by attention also to strengthening the home base to provide for the educational resources needed to support these outreach activitiessome of it in major developments like the Manhattanville campus to provide for growing academic needs; others in seemingly modest ways like providing a center for graduate students where they can meet together to discuss their common needs, as recommended by the Student Affairs Committee of the University Senate. This latter need not be a big project, but it is symbolically important that graduate students should have even a small facility where, to balance the inherent specialization of graduate schools, their common interests and shared concerns can be given a voice on the main campus, so that diversity is grounded in and sustained by shared human values.This is not the first time Columbia has faced the challenge of globalization. When we were thrust unexpectedly and for the first time into World War I, Columbia College responded with a new program called War and Peace Issues that eventually became incorporated into the Contemporary Civilization course, required of all undergraduates as the first component of the new Core Curriculum. This was soon followed in the '3os by Literature, Art, and Music Humanities. External engagement evoked an internal response to meet the challenge. The next phase was World War 11, which led to the development of courses dealing with the Asian Classics and Civilization comparable to those in Literature Humanities and CC, which became part of the core requirements with limited options in the 'sos and '6os. The more recent to-do about globalization so far has been a response primarily to opportunities offered for study centers abroad that focus on mini-campuses in major cities already heavily engaged in the world market economy. It seems a natural response to economic globalization, but the extent to which the new centers have robust links to the University's academic base is unclear. Dual-degree programs have been vetted by the University Senate's Executive Committee and approved by the Senate as a whole. They were treated as routine graduate programs that did not need to be discussed as part of a balanced university education. Study abroad, however, does not satisfy the need for a globalcore, and is no substitute for it. It is fine for summer adventuring but cannot fulfill the purposes of a core curriculum. Meanwhile, the global component of the Core Curriculum has not enjoyed a similar strengthening or enhancement. On the contrary, the present Global Core requirement has undergone such diversification as to erode any concept of core at all. Instead of focusing on shared human concerns across cultures, the distribution has featured diversity in the form of departmentalization or the substitution of different disciplinary approaches to learning. This diversification can of course accommodate itself easily to the variety of opportunities presented abroad, but it is not balanced by attention to the shared human values that should guide the process of globalization. This atrophy of the Core concept is accompanied today by an exclusive emphasis on diversity, as if the latter could stand on its own without consensual agreement on the shared human values that should underlie and nourish respect for diversity. Recently, major appointments to the central administration have been hailed as advancing diversity as a self-sufficient value, and questions as to the educational philosophy that should inform and support diversity go unanswered. As a result, Columbia has tended to lose the distinct educational character that formerly was identified with the College's Core Curriculum and which has so far been the strongest factor in student, faculty andespecially alumni support of the College. Now as we embark on new ""global"" enterprises, the University's increasing costs are being sustained by expanding college enrollment In the past when this had been attempted, the move to increase college tuition income was ostensibly accompanied by supposed enhancements to the College program, but anyone familiar with that program knows that these claimed ""enhancements"" have proven illusory. Any new moves to increase college enrollment should reckon with the danger they could represent to the dilution of the Core and its distinctive small-class, discussionmethod of instruction (in contrast to the large lecture classes exhibiting ""famous"" faculty ""performers"" common to other universities). The weakness of the Global Core and the decay of our commitment to the fundamental concepts of the Core are at the heart of the true question of how to deal with ""globalization."" It is what should be in the forefront of discussion by all segments of the Universitystudent, faculty, alumni—as well as bodies like the University Senate and the central administration.

28,Global Core,Partners in education?,8 November 2010,"Last week found me in my adviser's office. The topic at hand /as my frantic search for a spring internship. Rather than discuss the available internship options, though, the dean questioned the motivations of the search. Why, she inquired, do I want an internship? What benefit is there to yet another dreary semester-long occupation? Perhaps, she continued, I would use my semester better if I pursued academic interests. After all, I have a lifetime of office work to look forward to, and my time at college is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop my mind in ways that become unavailable after graduation. Why not take a painting class or that public speaking class at Barnard? Why not do something that would otherwise he impossible had I not taken four years to cultivate my mind? Looking beyond my seemingly primal need for that extra line on my resume, I saw that she had a point—a compelling one. After all, would one additional internship really benefit me substantially in the long run? I began to think that developing an unused side of my mind might serve me better for a longer period of time. Instead of developing myself only as a careerist, why not grow in ways that will benefit every facet of my life? What I found more compelling, though, was the interaction that had just taken place. I had walked into the office with a very solid conception of what I should do during my college career and left having abandoned that conviction in favor of one that would serve me better. Disappointingly, it had taken an external force to correct my shortsighted pursuit. I can't help but extend this scenario to our campus and find that we suffer from this mindset on an institutional level. As the 1968 riots and 2008 hunger strike suggest, we students frequently think that we know what is best for our college education. When the administration doesn't comply with our visions for a Columbia education, we revolt and coerce our way into our ideal. We often get our way, as indicated by the emergence of the global core and the business concentration. I can't help but wonder, though, if we students aren't susceptible to the shortsighted perspective I displayed in the adviser's office. After all, we can really only see what seems to be best for us now—a viewpoint dominated by the ever-nearing prospect of graduation and the ever-narrowing job market. It is extremely difficult for us as students to take a lifelong perspective and ignore the perceived needs of today in favor of the development of tomorrow.Given this, it may be in our best interest to defer to the people who have a better perspective. As empowering as it feels to make dramatic stands for what we think are the most beneficial aspects of education, it may be time to listen to what our professors and other established individuals have to say. It may be time to embrace the role of pupil and leave the teaching to the teachers. This concept shouldn't be foreign to Columbia students. After all, the Core Curriculum is a program that compels students to become educated in areas that would not otherwise be attractive to them. If students had a better conception of what it means to cultivate one's mind, then the administration wouldn't have to force us to read ""The Iliad,"" listen to Mozart, or compute the distance to the nearest star. In actuality, students have very strong incentives to do what serves them best in the short term. It takes external guidance to get us to work on our foundational development. This stance puts me in a difficult position since it seems to oppose the belief in freedom for the individual. If, for example, I suggested a University-wide ban on internships for the first three academic years, how could I defend it? What it comes down to is the nature of the University. Think of it as buying a service. By paying tuition, we are essentially hiring Columbia to develop us into individuals ready to contribute meaningfully to the world by the time we graduate. If we come into our college experience thinking that we know what is best for our education, we deny the experience and expertise of the professionals here. While I don't think that every instance of student activism for curricular changes is misguided or ineffectual, I do think that we as a student body should start giving the faculty the benefit of the doubt. It may irk us to acknowledge that they may know better than we do what is best for us, but we ignore them at our peril.

29,Global Core,"At year's first CCSC meeting, talk of dining changes, drug policies, new website",24 January 2011,"BY LEAH GREENBAUM Spectator Senior Staff WriterThe Columbia College Student Council began the spring semester vamped website and a new list of priorities. The council is likely to discuss reforming party and alcohol policies, the role of the Global Core requirement, and making the switch from Cub Mail to Gmail, said CCSC President Learned Foote, CC 'll. In addition to voting on new resolutions, Foote said CCSC will continue to work with the administration on changes to the new meal plan. In October, the council passed a series of recommendations asking Columbia Dining to reopen John Jay Dining Hall on weekends and revive the a la carte menu at JJ's Place. Those suggestions followed changes, implemented last fall, that have been profitable for the University but, according to CCSC surveys, disappointing to students. Foote said Dining will not negotiate reopening John Jay on weekends until March, when dining plans will be renewed and labor contracts with University employees run out. ""Changing what people had already bought didn't seemlike an option to Dining,"" Foote said, when asked why the changes couldn't be negotiated sooner. X * *»Footesalso annouaced that < ""Qffic® of' vj Affairs is reaching' out to the class councils to discuss the long-term effects of the December arrests of five Columbia students accused of selling drugs on campus. ""A lot of administrators are looking to work specifically with the councils.... They want to talk about how are students treated in their dorms by RAs, how they are treated by the NYPD ... to what degree does the judicial affairs process need to be transparent,"" he said. Despite the headlinegrabbing drug bust, Foote said that the University is still very receptive to the ""Good Samaritan"" policy, a proposal the council passed last semester that would grant amnesty to people and organizations who call ambulances for friends in the presence of underage drinking or illegal drugs. The council is working with the administration to finalize the language of that proposal, he said. Andrew Nguyen, CC 'l2 and vice president of policy for CCSC, said he hopes the council will take another shot atreforming party policies, specifically by making it easier for student groups to host events with alcohol. w Currently, the only student^alcohol are Lerner Pub' ana First Friday, both of which require two IDs to drink. Last year's vice president of policy, Sarah Weiss, CC 'lO, said that CCSC had given up on trying to renegotiate party policies, even though CCSC was once a strong critic of the ""War on Fun""—an alleged push by the University, beginning in 2007, to limit alcohol consumption, break up parties, and regulate events. ""There are restrictionslegal reasons—why students can't drink. So we feel there are greater battles to be fought,"" she told Spectator in December 2009, adding that those pushing for reform create unnecessary tension with the University. Karishma Habbu, CC 'l3 and vice president of communications, also unveiled a redesigned CCSC website with a Twitter feed. ""I've never tweeted before,"" said Foote—an admission that was met with disbelief from fellow council members. leah.greenbaum @columbiaspectator.com"
30,Global Core,Committee considers revisions to Global Core,10 February 2011,"BY MELANIE BRODER Spectator Staff WriterLess than three years since the requirement's debut, changes are coming to the Global Core. The University's Committee on the Global Core is looking to change the size and number of classes focused on ""nonWestern"" cultures that meet the Global Core requirement. ""The ideal is to have those courses resemble CC [Contemporary Civilization] and Lit Hum courses,"" said Kathryn Yatrakis, dean of academic affairs at Columbia College.To accomplish that, the list of courses that meet the requirement will be getting shorter, according to Patricia Grieve, the chair of the faculty Committee on the Global Core and the Nancy and Jeffrey Marcus Professor in the Humanities. The committee also plans to increase the number of small seminars and form connections between Global Core courses in an effort to bringthe requirement into line with other parts of the Core. Such changes would address criticisms like those of Kevin Zhai, CC 'l2, who said the Global Core doesn't build community like Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization do. ""I just think it's sort of bizarre where people have to choose [among different courses], and there is no unifying theme of 'Global Core-ness,""' he added.The two-course Global Core requirement was instituted in fall 2008, replacing the previous Major Cultures requirement, which the class of 2011 still has the option to fulfill. Grieve said that in 2008, the University made the list of courses ""larger than we think is ideal"" to make sure that all students were able to fulfill the requirement. According to the 2010-11 Columbia College Bulletin, over 120 courses currently fulfill the requirement, though most of those classes are not offered in a given semester. ""This year, the Committee is looking to reduce the number of courses on the list in consultation with the faculty who teach them, as new courses are developed, and as the criteria for Global Core become fully articulated,"" Grieve said in a statement. But overhauling a major curriculum requirement comes with challenges. Though the committee wants to encourage small seminars, Grieve noted that some departments offering important Global Core courses don't have enough instructors to replace all of their large lectures with seminars. One option is adding discussion sections to large lectures, though the committee is still determining the best way to make the changes. ""The Committee is currently examining ways to help faculty include a substantive discussion component in courses ... in order to allow for the kind of student interaction that is the hallmark of other Core courses,"" Grieve said. The Global Core is feeling pressure from more than just the faculty committee. Columbia College Student Council sent out a poll in early December asking students their opinions on the Global Core. Of the 171 students who responded to the survey, 65 percent said they did not feel the Global Core has a clear mission or purpose. Just over 70 percent said they felt that the best format for Global Core classes is ""small seminars, like Lit Hum and CC [Contemporary Civilization]."" ""There's such strong development in the Core Curriculum that the Global Core gets shafted, in a way, because it's so new,"" Amanda Tan, CC 'll and CCSC's academic affairs representative, said. Tan and Alex Jasiulek, the president for the Class of 2013 have been communicating about reviewing the Global Core, and hope to encourage more student participation in the revision process by holding a schoolwide open forum. The CCSC survey also showed a large divide among students about what the Global Core should accomplish. Almost 56 percent of respondents said they thought its main purpose is to ""introduce students to 'non-Western' cultures,"" and just over 45 percent said they think its purpose should be to ""give students a theoretical framework for examining both 'non-Western' cultures and the 'Western' culture that informs our own thinking."" Tony Baker, CC 'l3, agreed that a sense of ambiguity in the Global Core made for a superficial treatment of non-Western culture. ""I just think that two semesters is kind of token,"" Baker said. ""If you want to major in those areas, then you can really get a deeper appreciation of those subjects, but everyone just kind of does like a one year huge gloss-over survey."" Barry Weinberg, CC 'l2 and student representative to the University's Committee on the Core, said he hopes discussing the Global Core is part of a larger discussion on what the Core Curriculum means to Columbia students. ""There is an interest in the students for kind of a large event or a campus-wide dialogue on what the Core really means to Columbia and how it applies today,"" Weinberg said. ""And part of that would be how the Global Core fits in.""

31,Global Core,STAFF EDITORIAL Correcting the core,16 February 2011,"Correcting the coreAs a relatively new addition to the Columbia Core Curriculum, the Global Core is undergoing continual reevaluation. The proposed changes highlight serious flaws in the structure of Global Core classes. Global Core courses have been criticized for being too large, too broad, and too dissimilar from other core classes like Contemporary Civilization or Literature Humanities. The Committee on the Global Core is considering adding more discussion sections to large lectures and increasing the number of seminars, which may reduce the number of Global Core classes offered. While we applaud the initiative to decrease class sizes, we question whether the Global Core courses should be modeled after the arguably more successful CC and Lit Hum. A Western canonical trajectory may not suit the rest of the world. Either way, it's evident that the Global Core suffers from internal issues as well as structural flaws. The survey courses that most students take to fulfill the Global Core requirement often treat varied and complex material in a brusque and superficial manner.Survey courses try to narrativize the histories of huge, often dissimilar regions—the Middle East or Africa—in a linear fashion. This approach means that students are familiar with the texts that they study, but not in an intimate fashion. While the proposed changes may help address the Global Core's content-related problems, we still find ourselves unsure over the Global Core's role in Columbia's education. The place of Lit Hum and CC in a Columbia College education, while contested, is relatively clear.Though most students know that the Global Core's premise is to familiarize students with non-Western traditions, it seems that the University lacks a clear, unified vision—or has just failed to communicate the importance of the Global Core and explain why it exists. We sense this confusion when we sign up for a course that turns out to be ""too Western"" to fulfill the Global Core requirement. Especially around course registration, we find ourselves wondering by what standards—if any—the Global Core is based on.It's evident that the Global Core suffers from internal issues as well as structural flaws."
32,Global Core,UNPOPULAR MECHANICS Unpopular Mechanics the inner workings of student council—and whether or not we should care,7 April 2011,"Unpopular Mechanicsthe inner workings of student council—and whether or not we should careby Sarah Ngu cover illustration by Colin Sullivanby Sarah Ngu illustration by Colin SullivanThe inner workings of student council—and whether we should care,It's a Friday morning. Five students are sitting around a small table on the fifth floor of Lerner Hall, holding an executive board meeting for the Columbia College Student Council. One of the members, Learned Foote, has a 70-page thesis due on Monday and is contemplating skipping the meeting next Sunday. The catch is that he is president and is in charge of running that meeting. A half-serious debate ensues on who should lead it in his place. ""I can run it,"" Brandon Christophe, a junior, proclaims confidently. He is the pre-med frat boy from Texas who handles finances, which covers the executive board's programming and the funding process of student groups. ""No, I should be the one leading it,"" Karishma Habbu, a sophomore and the youngest of the group, steps in, with a fairly serious smile. She is not wearing her usual bright-red pea coat, but her energy is still evident as she gesticulates. Her role in the group is fitting: She handles communications between the council and the student body. ""Under the constitution, I'm supposed to lead the meeting if Learned can't be there,"" Andrew Nguyen, a junior, says. As usual, not a hair is out of place. Only the pullover sweater he is wearing, instead of his usual collared shirt and sweater vest, gives away the fact that he rolled out of bed 10 minutes ago. Nguyen is in charge of passing policies, such as the Good Samaritan Policy and installing a sign-up sheet for the Mcßain gym. They squabble some more, citing precedents and principles of fairness, but it is force that ends the debate. Christophe swiftly smacks Habbu lightly on the head, generating laughter from everyone, including Habbu. Foote is smiling, enjoying the back and forth. As president of the council, his primary role is to liaisebetween the council and the administration. Nguyen often gives him proposed policy changes to bring up in his weekly meetings with administration. Finally, Foote ends the playful bickering. Depending on how his thesis goes, he says, he'll see if he can make the meeting (he ends up missing it and Nguyen runs it) and proceeds to spit out the agenda from memory. Business resumes as usual. In a few weeks, after elections are over, a new board will occupy this room. The competition is more heated than in past years, with three tickets vying for the executive board. But the increase in competition might veiy well translate, for most students, solely to increase in annoying flyers with smiling people and increase in empty campaign promises—essentially, an increase in media to tune out. The walls of the meeting room that separate the executive board from the rest of student body are more than physical. The student body's general apathy toward student government, which the executive board presides over, is well known. Perennial complaints remain: Student government is an elite institution that is disconnected from the student body. Student government is a glorified party planning committee. And if ever they wanted to do more than just plan parties, they would be unable—student government has little power in this labyrinthine bureaucracy where graduate students outnumber undergrads. In January, curious about how valid these three main complaints were, I began attending meetings and interviewing current students and alumni. Undergraduate student government includes all four undergraduate schools, but 1 focused my questions on Columbia College, the largest of them all, and its executive board. Should we care about student government? And what has this board done over the past year? Complaint #1: Student Government is Disconnected from Student Body Disconnect between a government, consisting of a small number of people, and the public, consisting of everyone else, is inherent to some degree in any political system. Still, the disconnect at Columbia seems particularly severe, seeing as only 34 percent of Columbia College students voted in last year's election. The responsibility of facilitating dialogue between the council and the student body falls under Habbu, who leads the communications committee. When a recent Spectator editorial, ""Counsel for the Council, ""criticizing the council's lack of communication to the student body, is brought up at the meeting, Habbu immediately speaks up. ""Okay, I have something to say about that editorial,"" she says, launching into a point-by-point explanation of where the editorial erred, stressing that council members have in fact sat in Butler and Lerner every week, trading cupcakes for student ideas, as part of the CCSC Cafes initiative, which began last year. Given that the initiative had poor results—aver - aging only 25-30 ""fluffy"" responses per week—it was nixed this semester. This semester, to replace the Cafes, the communications committee met with 18 student groups to determine their biggest complaints. They forwarded the top three concerns to the policy committee. CCSC further facilitates dialogue between students and administration through monthly Admin Connects, which serve free lunch and provide an hour of discus-sion with an administrator. On an institutional level, this year's Council has created liaisons for sustainability, club sports, Greek life, and Community Impact. Three resolutions relating to sustainability and club sports have been passed, due largely to input by liaisons. Although attendance has improved, liasions are present at CCSC meetings inconsistently, with about half of the liasions absent regularly. Lastly, online outreach has been successful, especially when many students are already passionate about an issue. Around 750 students tilled out a dining poll sent through the Weekly Growler, filling up a total of 25 single-spaced pages with comments. Meanwhile, Foote receives around 10-15 emails a week from students after he sends out his Weekly Growler, and he reads Bwog and Spectator religiously. But while outreach to students has certainly benefited the council on the policy side, campus life and finance still lack feedback. Only 64 students filled out a poll about campus life events. ""There's a frustrating disconnect between the planning of student life events and what Columbia students actually want to see, as much as we try [to assess students' opinions through various avenues],"" Andrea Folds, a junior and VP of Campus Life, says. This gap between government and public runs the other way as well: The student body is generally uninformed of the activities of the council. Public ignorance fosters a public lack of interest in student council, meaning lower voter turnouts. This year's communications committee has tried to confront the problem by revamping the CCSC website, flyering, and, as all hip organizations do nowadays, tweeting extensively to its 148 followers. Informing nearly 5,000 Columbia College students on what its council is up to, however, is understandably and legitimately not high on the council's priority list. The council ought to focus on enacting change: The responsibility for informing the public of those changes falls on the campus media. Occasionally, a big story, like gender-neutral housing, is covered intensely, but otherwise, updates on student government mostly consist of soporific lists. There are no mid-year or end-of-the-year progress reports on ongoing policies, partly because reporters do not attend policy meetings, they attend general council meetings where fully-formed policies are voted on. But do the council's activities merit more coverage in the first place? Complaint #2: Student Government is a Glorified Party-Planning Committee Some parts of student government, namely the class councils and the campus-life committee, certainly plan parties. Their work is distinctly different from the work of the policy committee, whose historic accomplishments include keeping Butler Libraiy open 24 hours and encouraging gender-neutral housing. Under the current stewardship of Andrew Nguyen, the policy committee hasn't yet successfully pushed for any equivalently earth-shattering initiatives, but it has been quite active, with 14 passed resolutions, seven of which have already been implemented. Nguyen begins his policy meetings at 4 p.m. on Sunday, holding a document detailing all the campaign promises his party has made. Though these campaign promises are important, many of this year's policies issues, such as the sudden appearance of long lines at Lerner Mail Services, could not have been an-ticipated during last year's election season. Additionally, student groups have initiated some key policies; Students for a Sensible Drug Policy proposed the Good Samaritan Policy, and the heads of a few campus publications proposed supplying publications racks. The more significant ongoing projects, such as publishing course evaluations online, will require more than a year's work. That said, virtually all policies passed by CCSC, with the exception of the Good Samaritan Policy, involve small-scale, practical changes to make the lives of certain groups of students easier. This year's council may not just be planning useless parties, but they aren't quite shaking up the status quo either, at least not like the council did in 2006. Back then, Columbia had yet to eliminate loans for families making under $50,000 a year. Financial aid reform was a priority for the administration, but it wasn't near the top, despite the fact that a student financial aid coalition had been mobilizing for nearlya year. Seth Flaxman, then-president of the Columbia University College Democrats, ran for president of CCSC, making financial aid reform the main priority of his ticket. His victory sent a clear message to the administration: The majority of students wanted financial aid reform above all else. Within six months, grants replaced loans for families making under $50,000 a year. This year's emphasis on many small-scale policies rather than few large-scale policies intentionally departs from last year's. In a Bwog interview last year, both Nguyen and Foote mentioned that they want to increase the ""breadth"" of policies pursued. ""I think that the current council has been very impressive, "" Foote said then, commenting on 20092010's board. ""I think that there have been times, though, when, in the past year, depth has sacrificed breadth."" Last year's board passed around four policies, whereas this year's has passed 14. It might not be a stretch to say that breadth may have sacrificed depth this year. Nguyen says that he regrets not pushing for more ""big-picture policies,"" but says that it was a function of him trying to master the learning curve this year and pursue whatever the student body wanted him to pursue. Being the ""voice"" of the student body is a grand ideal, but the reality is that any"
33,Global Core,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR,29 April 2011,"To the Editor: Spectator's editorial, (""Finding Our Place,"" Apr. 25) correctly targets the failure of the University's new Global Centers Program to provide a place for undergraduates in either the planning or execution of the program—so far just a belated afterthought of the administration. A better afterthought would be to remember the recent adage ""Think globally, act locally."" What tends to be forgotten is that Columbia has been acting globally for some time at the core of its undergraduate program, which developed its Asian Humanities and Civilization courses in the late 1940s as the global extension of its initial Core. What is new today is that colleges in Asia, recovering and now rebounding from the traumatic effects of westernization, are trying to recover a'sense of their own home place in the midst of globalization and have begun to work with Columbia on a global core which would draw selectively on a common list of classics representing the major world traditions. So far more than 30 Asian colleges have joined in this process as reported in a publication of the Heyman Center for the Humanities, entitled ""Classics for an Emerging World"" (2008). If any of us wants to ""Find Our Place,"" as the Spectator's editorial has it, we should engage in this ongoing process of consultation, recognizing that our world is actually getting smaller and growth today means expanding, not into unlimited space, but into each other's spaces. It is a more crowded world and the crowd has to learn more about each other if we are to survive together. How can this be done without learning how each of us has managed to survive at all? The classics of the major traditions are survivorsthemselves. They tell us what every civilized people have considered their own ""tried and true values""—their take on the key issues of human survival—which could still sustain them in the globalization process. If ""globalization"" does not simply mean a spotting of market opportunities—a chasing of ephemeral, will-o-the-wisps that flash out here and there, all over the place—it should work out from a home base that is recognizable to people working out of their own home bases, hopefully to meet us at least half way. ""Working out"" means having a sense of where you are coming from and where you want to go. It should not be left to chance encounters and improvisation at global centers anywhere at all. Working with people abroad who understand the educational problem and are in touch with Columbia's Core program, as well as with our University Committee on Asia and the Middle East, we would have a home base on which to ground our new efforts. It would be entirely appropriate for Columbia students to take an active role in this effort. While the administration is flying high over the globe, students on the ground here who already have some experience with the Core, and especially with our Global Core courses, are in a good position to take the lead. Spectator is right on target in pressing for this. Sincerely yours, Wm. Theodore de Bary John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University and Provost Emeritus Special Service Professor Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures"
34,Global Core,What's in a canon?,6 September 2011,"Starting this year, the Literature Humanities section of the Core Curriculum changes again, adding Goethe's Faust but dropping three works—Hymn to Demeter, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and The Decameron—to reveal a new, leaner bookshelf for the class of 2015. The cut in itself is not unusual—the Lit Hum syllabus has evolved plenty in its time, with many texts on the list of revisions having come and gone long before our current batch of Columbia students ever set foot on campus. And, while the change may invite some small uproar from seniors who had to read, Sparknote, or feign ignorance about the few hundred pages that are now no longer required reading, the new 2011 syllabus is less likely to incur an outcry of ""If we had to do it, so do you!"" than it is to bring up the old question of what makes the Core the Core. First-years will not have to be on campus for very long before they are presented with a laundry list of complaints from aggrieved seniors: Lit Hum, especially, is often criticized of being composed almost entirely of dead, white men.The Core Text Comparative Chart 2010-2011 could be said to pigeonhole Literature Humanities readings into a straight-line chronology of the Western world, giving Ancient Near Eastern Texts and Archaic Greek Poetry a small fighting chance before plunging forward from Hellenistic Greek and Hebrew Texts to Latin Literature Under Rome, and then on through the Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods, and so on until we burst out into the brave, new, modern world. For a school that likes to lay claim to a diverse, international student body, Lit Hum can seem like a bald-faced rejection of the fact that the world exists beyond the amorphous geographic region we call the ""West."" Less well-known than Lit Hum is its Eastern counterpart, though perhaps ""counterparts"" may be a better word for the colloquia that exist in the borderlands of the Global Core requirement. There is, for one, the AHUM V 3999 and V 3400 sequence, which furnishes students with a historical Middle Eastern, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese reading list as (or more) formidable as Lit Hum's. Professor William Theodore deBary, who was behind the original conception of Asian Humanities at Columbia, continues to teach these classes as a testament to his belief in the importance of regional voices besides those presented in Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization. How feasible, though, is the creation of a Core that distills and teaches everything? As any Columbia student who took first-year Core classes knows, the chances of getting through just Lit Hum alone without ""accidentally"" forgetting to read a few chapters or double-checking Wikipedia ""just to be sure"" are statistically improbable. Everyone's human. Even the mighty get myopia. Dual-wielding Lit Hum or CC with Asian Humanities, as your columnist tried to do on more than one occasion, is an almost sure-fire way to land yourself in a padded white cell. So how are Columbia students supposed to get a well-rounded view of the world—the whole world—when we can't seem to pin down an inclusive but manageable set of core texts? The overall problem isn't, as I see it, that one canon, Eastern or Western or anything-ern, is more important than the other and should therefore receive a position in our schedules that bears more gravitas. The difficulty is in trying to define any canon—and, by extension, any Core—at all. The uncomfortable truth is that the world is wider than we could ever imagine it to be: Just walk down the corridor and knock on a neighbor's door. Chances are that the person who answers will have a view of race, gender, sexuality, politics, history, ethics, etc., that is staggeringly different from yours for reasons that are deep and profound. Studying where ""we,"" as a collective whole, came from is a global project that requires the detailing of endless influences. Yet the Core tries to do just that: to understand, and to find ways of reaching that understanding. As the Bulletin says, ""the pursuit of better questions is every bit as important as the pursuit of better answers."" Neither Lit Hum nor CC are, at the end of the day, best-guess answers to the conundrum of what a good liberal arts reading list should look like. Their value lies in the question (often screamed at our books, but more importantly at each other): ""Why are we doing this?!"" Why do we read what we do, and should we read beyond it, and why don't we read beyond it? And, on the other side, other canons are waiting: other cores, sans the capital ""C""; other shores.Po Linn Chia is a Columbia College junior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.

35,Global Core,"Stricter standards in place for Global Core 84 courses now count towards Global Core, down from 120 last year",23 September 2011,"84 courses now count towards Global Core, down from 120 last yearBY BEN GITTELSON Columbia Daily SpectatorThe Global Core is still very much a work in progress. This year students have returned to campus to find a revised list of Global Core courses that includes more seminar-style and fewer lecture-based classes. Patricia Grieve, the Nancy and Jeffrey Marcus Professor of the Humanities and chair of the Committee on the Global Core, said there are also stricter standards in place for determining which courses satisfy the requirement. Classes must now include the use of primary materials, and the Committee on the Global Core will give preference to comparative courses. Eighty-four courses are now approved, compared to more than 120 last semester. Grieve emphasized that the committee shortened the list as a result of its new standards, but could expand it again in the future. Alex Jasiulek, CC 'l3, who led a survey of the student body as the president of the Class of 2013 last year, said the changes are a step in the right direction. But he added that the administration still has a ways to go. ""They're glossing over the fact that while there are the added seminars, there still remain courses like History ofthe Modern Middle East that are huge,"" Jasiulek said. ""If they're committed to these principles, I want to make sure the courses that existed before the Global Core did are still being held accountable to the [new] standards.""Jasiulek helped prepare recommendations about changes to the Global Core last year. These recommendations included smaller classes, more ""theoretical engagement,"" and a ""discussion of the interaction between Western and global ideas."" Students have had mixed reactions to their new Global Core options. Isaac Bunch, CC 'l4, said he worries the new list will limit students' choices. He said the Global Core should givestudents a chance to branch out and fears that a shorter list could result in scheduling conflicts. ""If there wasn't a choice, the University would be telling us what global cultures are more important to learn about, and they've already done that with putting Western culture up front with Lit Hum and CC,"" Bunch said. But Malika Leiper, CC 'l3, said she thinks that the addition of more seminar-style classes will force students to delve deeper into the texts in their Global Core classes. She thought the previous requirements weren't focused enough and welcomed the tighter standards. ""I felt like it [the Global Core] was kind of just there to be there, but it didn't seem to have a focus,"" Leiper said. ""I think it could be a good thing that they're trying to have a clearer goal.""Naomi Senbet, CC 'l4, said she is ambivalent about the addition of new seminars, but concerned about the shortening of the list. ""Choice is always better,"" Senbet said. ""There are so many options out there that I don't think eliminating certain lecture-based classes is going to change how people view the Global Core."" Jasiulek said he is worried professors and administrators are not fully engaged in the restructuring process. But despite his concerns, he said he is pleased with the new list and course selection standards, adding that some of the new classes on the list are ""fantastic."" ""They [the Committee on the Global Core] did produce a lot of positive results this year,"" Jasiulek said.

36,Global Core,STAFF EDITORIAL Suggestions for Dean Valentini,30 September 2011,"Suggestions for Dean ValentiniDean Valentini has emphasized his eagerness to hear students' ideas on how to improve Columbia College. With such a receptive Dean at the helm of our school, students have a unique opportunity to have their voices heard on issues important to undergraduates. We have a few suggestions of our own to offer. Open Course Evaluations Just a week after Dean Valentini voiced his measured support of open course evaluations, President Bollinger formally endorsed the move to make course evaluations public. As students, we often have to rely on CULPA to glean information about our courses, which tends to attract feedback from students with polarizing views. The move to make course evaluations open would allow for alarger sampling of student opinions, including those who don't profess undying love or burning hatred for a particular professor. SEAS already has open course evaluations, and to our knowledge, they have proven helpful. Make the Global classes smaller Though Dean Valentini briefly suggested changes to the Global Core, reevaluating the effectiveness of the Global Core is imperative. The number of Global Core options aside, the majority of these classes are structured as large lectures. Since the Global Core serves as a counterpoint to the Western canon we learn in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Global Core classes should have a similar structure. Much of the learning that takes place in Lit Hum and CC occurs during discussion, and to miss out on such an enriching part of the educational process for the non-Western world is a shame. There are currently only a handful of options for Global Core classes that are taught as small seminars. Nevertheless, there are undoubtedly too many students in Columbia College to allow for all Global Core classes to function as seminars with current financial allocation.We hope that Dean Valentini understands that we would like to have Global Core classes that are as enlightening as those we take in the rest of Columbia's canon, and can do something to change that. Get rid of Cub Mail Though we are no experts of things computer-related, we do know that CubMail—Columbia's email client—is downright awful. While many students forward emails from their @columbia.edu accounts to Gmail, others just decide to grit their teeth and deal with Cub Mail's utter failure as a system. It shouldn't be too difficult for Dean Valentini to persuade CUIT to adopt a better email browser—Barnard recently made the switch from their old system to a version of Gmail. Martinis with Dean Valentini Last but certainly not least, we would like to see Dean Valentini offer a hip, cosmopolitan counterpoint to President Bollinger's ""Fireside Chats"" or former Dean Moody-Adams' ""Tea with Moody-Adams."" We recommend he inaugurate a series of ""Martinis with Dean Valentini""—spots would certainly fill up quickly."
37,Global Core,"Honey, I shrunk the class!",4 October 2011,"While many of us bemoan Columbia's course registration process, we often forget the schedule troubles that we faced in high school. Those were the days when the number of class choices was only in the dozens, when taking a ""regular"" class might encumber one's GPA, and when some of us were never able to take physics since state enrollment caps prevented us from getting into the class (Physics for Poets, here I come). For years, I had felt the blow of class-size laws as they stopped me from getting into desired courses and caused administrators to scramble to meet impossible standards. I just didn't get the fuss. Over the past several years, the issue of keeping class sizes small has been the centerpiece of the national education debate. The 2001 No Child Left Behind act ended the $4.1 billion class-size reduction program, bringing the issue to the forefront of the past decade's deliberation. In 2009, President Barack Obama's secretary of education Arne Duncan unveiled Race to the Top, a $4.35 billion education' competition between state's that included class enrollment caps as one of its primary criteria for funding evaluation. Today, despite a continued push for smaller classes, New York City schools are facing the highest number of oversized classes in a decade, with over 7,000 classrooms exceeding their contractual enrollment limits for the 20112012 academic year. Why all of the attention? Perhaps it is because the question of reduced class sizes doesn't have an easy yes-or-no answer. While hundreds of research studies like Project Student Teacher Achievement Ratio have focused on the benefits of smaller class sizes, the results have been mixed and inconclusive. Even in studies that have shown an overwhelming correlation between reduced class size and student performance, confounding variables are rampant. Comparing data from schools with smaller class sizes to schools with higher caps often involves a direct comparison between affluent schools that have the resources to reduce size and indigent programs that can't even afford to preserve the status quo. Moreover, schools often reserve smaller class sizes for students with behavioral problems or on the ESOL track, so poor performance from students in smaller classes is probably a better reflection of outside factors than it is of the effectiveness of a lower student-teacher ratio. A reduced ratio also comes with an immense cost. In May, the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution reported that ""increasing the pupil/ teacher ratio in the U.S. by one student would save at least $l2 billion per year in teacher salary costs alone."" Since the evidence doesn't say that smaller class sizes are inherently more conducive to learning, there is a prodigious incongruity between expenditures and efficacy. At a time when budget crunches have left no state unsullied and schools have had to cut back on textbook purchases and arts programs in order to fulfill class-size requirements, the fact that legislation has been based on inconclusive evidence is troubling. Yet none of this seemed to matter before I came to college. Spoiled by contained class sizes, I had never seen why the idea of adding a few extra students was branded as so deleterious. Then I was introduced to my first lecture-hall class. While my professor was engaging and the material was interesting, I couldn't help but feel like I was missing out on something as I was instructed from 15 rows below. I realized how lucky I had been and how lucky I am. Columbia's undergraduate students are incredibly fortunate to have the support of an administration that sees the importance of small classroom learning. The 22-person Literature Humanities course tucked away in Hamilton is an unthinkable anomaly within an American university system dominated by colossal lecture halls. Yet the advantages that we have in some classes show us where we still have room for improvement in others. When large lecture classes exist, departments make an effort to include supplementary TA-led discussions. However, this system leaves much to be desired. For one, the quality of TAs varies greatly across the board, leaving two students enrolled in the same course with very different classroom experiences. Moreover, this arrangement detaches learning from discussion. Physically separating the introduction of the material from critical discourse engenders an education barrier—in effect, we are taught that learning and thinking are two distinct processes. The recent commitment of the Committee on the Global Core to include more seminar-style courses and to tighten enrollment is a harbinger of good things to come. It is an issue that certainly needs to be discussed in other classes, notably Frontiers of Science, which has made a laughable attempt to have half of the first-year class attend a weekly lecture. Five weeks of college have taught me something that education research in elementary and secondary schools has yet to confirm—size matters.Jared Odessky is a first-year in Columbia College.

38,Global Core,Struggles to find Core teachers continue Declining percentages of tenured professors mean more adjuncts,14 October 2011,"Declining percentages of tenured professors mean more adjunctsBY SAMMY ROTH Spectator Senior Staff WriterMore than a third of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations classes were taught by graduate students last year, and more than 15 percent were taught by adjunct professors, while a quarter of Lit Hum and CC sections were taught by tenured or tenure-track professors. The Core has been the centerpiece of undergraduate education at Columbia for more than 90 years, but for administrators and department chairs, finding people to teach it is a constant struggle. The number of tenured and tenure-track professors teaching in the Core has been steadily declining, creating a need for more adjunct professors, postdoctoral students, and graduate students, and it's sometimes difficult just to find a teacher for every Core section. ""We worry about Core teaching every year. It hasn't changed,"" Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks said. ""Some years we do better than other years. But I mean, it's been a regular worry."" Philosophy professor Michele Moody-Adams raised concerns about the health of the Core Curriculum when she resigned as dean of Columbia College this summer. In her resignation letter to alumni, Moody-Adams cited impending structural changes to the University that would ""ultimately compromise the College's academic quality and financial health."" But administrators saythere is no reason for students to worry about either the College or the Core. And Dirks told Spectator that the Core Curriculum was not discussed in McKinsey & Company's recent report on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a report some have speculated prompted Moody-Adams to resign. Philosophy professor Christia Mercer, the chair of Literature Humanities, said that there are ways to strengthen the Core, but that its problems aren't new. ""I am not concerned any more than I was six months ago,"" she said. 'ANY INCREASE WOULD BE WELCOME' Some departments, like history and English, contribute disproportionately to the teaching of the Core, but other departments keep their distance. Dirks said that he works with departments to set quotas for Core teaching, but those quotas aren't always met. Departments are also tasked with staffing their own undergraduate courses and graduate level courses, and sometimes there aren't enough professors to go around. Of the nine tenured or ten-ure-track professors in the Slavic languages and literatures department, seven regularly teach in the Core Curriculum. But when it comes to staffing the Core Curriculum, the Slavic department is more the exception than the rule. Department Chair Alan Timberlake said that his professors really enjoy the contentof the Core. But that's not the only reason they teach it, he said. ""It seems like a natural place to participate in the University, to have a place in the University life,"" he said. Of the 22 tenured or tenuretrack professors in the anthropology department, for instance, only one is teaching a Core class this semester, save for courses that count towards the Global Core requirement. ""We've made deals with departments at different times, and we've sought to get the departments to ante up to the agreements stipulated,"" Dirks said. ""But it doesn't always work, and then we have to hire adjuncts or others to teach in the Core."" Dirks, an anthropology professor, said that in the 1993-94 academic year, 17 percent of Lit Hum and CC sections were taught by tenured professors, compared to 15 percent last year. But in the long term, tenured and tenure-track professors are teaching in the Core less frequently. East Asian Studies professor and former provost William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, MA '4B, PhD '53, who has taught at Columbia since 1949, said that the proportion of Core sections taught by tenured and tenure-track professors used to be ""much larger."" ""Any increase would be welcome,"" de Bary said. Dirks added that in the 199192 academic year, there were 195 Lit Hum and CC sections, compared to 242 last year, which has made it even more difficult to keep the Core staffed by regular faculty members. ""The faculty is stretched really pretty thin, and we have to treat the Core as a priority, but that nevertheless has to be thought of in relationship to all the other things the departments have to mount,"" he said. Lit Hum and CC in particular have been impacted by those trends, particularly in light of increases in the Columbia College student body without a corresponding increase in the size of the departments that tend to staff these classes. Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that there is a ""downward trajectory of percentages"" when it comes to tenured and tenure-track professors teaching these classes. ""I'm optimistic that now that it's on people's agendas, we can focus some of our work in this area,"" Yatrakis said. PERSUASION AND CAJOLING But hiring more faculty members to teach the Core might not be enough. Even if departments had enough professors to teach the Core and all their specialized classes, administrators and department chairs would still have to convince individual professors to teach. And for some professors, the Core just isn't a priority. ""Even chairs have a great deal of difficulty telling their faculty what to teach,"" Dirks said. ""They have to persuade them, they have to cajole them."" Many professors would prefer to teach their specialties, and young tenure-track professors especially are driven by the need to do research and publish. ""If you haven't published, you have a hard time getting a job at all,"" de Bary said. ""And you're not going to get published unless you have something special to offer the publisher."" Senior professors, too, are pulled in many directions. ""A senior professor has a lot of different obligations, and it's hard to juggle those,"" Mercer said. Meanwhile, teaching in the Core takes a lot of work—especially Lit Hum and CC, which meet almost four hours per week, involve heavy reading loads and require professors to grade essays without the help of teaching assistants. And in general, teaching in the Core forces faculty members to teach outside their specialties, something which, as Director of the Center for the Core Curriculum Roosevelt Montas, CC '95, M.A. '96, Ph.D 'O4, put it, ""no professor does willingly."" ""The incentives of the profession pull against teaching in the Core,"" Montas said.ADJUNCTS AND POSTDOCS Lit Hum and CC classes that aren't taught by professors, associate professors or assistant professors—all of whom are tenured or tenure-track—are taught by a combination of grad students, postdocs, adjunct professors, a few retired professors like de Bary and several one-year departmental appointees known as lecturers. History professor Matthew Jones, the chair of Contemporary Civilization, said that ""we want as few adjunct professors teaching in the Core as we can."" But he added that some postdocs, who are often hired as adjuncts at Columbia on their way to tenure-track jobs elsewhere, are ""exactly the sort of professors that you as students want.""Similarly, many University Writing classes are taught by adjunct professors and parttime hires, according to English professor Nicole Wallack, the director of the Undergraduate Writing Center. Music professor Elaine Sisman, the chair of Music Humanities, said that some full professors continue to teach Music Hum, but that many sections are taught by pcfttdocs. ""It both cushions them between graduate school and the job market and keeps excellent teachers in the Core,"" Sisman said. Biology professor Darcy Kelley, a co-chair of Frontiers of Science, said that the bulk of the weekly seminars in Frontiers, too, are taught by postdoc research fellows. Most of these fellows teach two seminars per semester—which, Kelley noted, Columbia College defines as a full teaching load—while still doing research to ensure that they can get jobs after their fellowships end. Additionally, a few years ago Dirks started the Core Assistant Professorships program, an initiative to hire postdocs who already taught Core classes while graduate students at Columbia. Dirks said that CAPs are currently funded out of the Arts and Sciences budget, although A&S is working to raise funds to support them. University Trustees Jonathan Lavine, CC 'BB, and Gerry Lenfest, Law '5B, each recently pledged $2.5 million to match gifts that endow CAPs. 'BURSTING AT THE SEAMS' Finding more tenured and tenure-track faculty to teach in the Core is one thing, but just finding someone to cover each section is a challenge on its own. There are some systematic staffing problems in the Core—every year, teachers drop out of classes at the last minute or decide to go on leave, and the number of students from the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of General Studies enrolled in Core cjasses changes from year to year. In the last few years, though, there have been fewer grad students applying to teach in the Core, too. ""We are expecting and have been getting big drops in graduate students,"" Montas said. There are a few reasons for this drop-off. For one, GSAS deliberately decreased its class size by 10 percent three years ago, a change that Montas said is just starting to hit the Core. Another complication is that three years ago, the grad school decided to more strictly enforceits policy that students cannot receive funding past their seventh year of study, GSAS Dean Carlos Alonso said. Grad students had frequently applied for a two-year Core preceptor position in their seventh year, and GSAS had previously made an exception and and funded eighth-year students teaching in the Core. Alonso attributed the decrease in grad students applying to teach in the Core to ""the onerous nature of the commitment to teach in the Core,"" but added that he has lobbied Columbia College to accept Core preceptors for just one year. Yatrakis, though, said GSAS students were never actually required to make a two-year commitment to the Core—rather, the Core was committed to keeping the graduate students it hired for two years if they wanted to teach a second year. She said she hopes that once this confusion is cleared up more grad students will teach in the Core during their seventh years only. ""Those who teach in the seventh year and complete their dissertation, now have an incentive to also apply to be a Core Assistant Professor,"" Yatrakis said. But when it comes to staffing, sometimes the ends still don't meet. In University Writing this semester, a perfect storm of professors dropping out at the last minute and an increased number of SEAS students, combined with a pre-planned ""tight"" enrollment of classes, left UWriting without enough instructors, Wallack said. Since all Columbia College first-years must take UWriting one semester and Frontiers of Science during the other, Frontiers is overenrolled this Semester. Kelley described the course as ""bursting at the seams somewhat."" ""You need more faculty to teach it,"" she said. ""And the teachers are the most expensive part of the Core."" 'THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN THEIR MISSION' Paying for teachers is expensive generally, but paying for Core teachers is even more so, as Columbia provides several financial incentives for faculty who teach in the Core. Currently, the Chamberlain Fellowship provides tenuretrack junior faculty with one semester off at full pay if they teach six semesters of the Core. And senior faculty are rewarded with a summer stipend of $7,000 after teaching four sections of the Core, although they can only get this stipend once every four years. Mercer said that to make the Core ""as great as it can be,"" incentives need to be increased. She suggested that the first time a professor teaches in the Core, there should be a $5,000-$6,000 bonus, followed by $2,000$3,000 rewards for each additional Core section taught. ""We need to put our money where our mouth is,"" she said. It's unclear if and when incentives will increase, but Yatrakis and Dirks said they are working to raise money to expand those programs. Dirks noted that he is fundraising for the Chamberlain endowment fund, and Yatrakis said she would like to raise the summer stipend for senior faculty to SIO,OOO. But Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini said that he has been talking to professors about how they decide what classes to teach, and he hasn't yet decided if increasing monetary incentives will do the trick. ""It's a general consideration of a structure which involves rewards, inducements, incentives, whatever, to satisfy all of the objectives,"" Valentini said. ""Of which the Core is one, but not the only one we have."" De Bary said that while greater monetary incentives would certainly help convince more senior faculty members to teach in the Core, the biggest roadblock is not financial. ""The principle strength of the Core in the past was the sense of collegiality among those who were teaching it. They really believed in their mission. That's more important than anything else,"" de Bary said. ""Trouble is that that mission does not count very heavily in appointment and tenure promotion."" sammy.roth @columbiaspectator.com""We've sought to get the departments to ante up to the agreements stipulated. But it doesn't always work, and then we have to hire adjuncts or others to teach in the Core."" —Nicholas Dirks, Executive Vice President of Arts and SciencesCORE OF THE CORE Mark Lilla, a tenured professor of humanities and religion, teaches a section of Literature Humanities."
39,Global Core,Alumni gift supports new Global Core classes,28 October 2011,"BY PARUL GULIANI Columbia Daily SpectatorA quarter-million dollar gift is spurring the development of new classes for the Global Core, which is continuing to evolve more than four years since its inception. Five Global Core courses being taught this semesterAfrican Civilization, Sex in the Tropics, Archaeology and Africa, Native America, and Slavic Cultures—were developed at a weeklong workshop this May, the first in a series of five workshops focused on developing new Global Core courses and improving existing ones. Arnold Chavkin, Business '77, and his wife Laura Chang, Business '77, gave $250,000 to fund the workshops. With four to go, the list of global core options is sure to keep shifting. The IS faculty members who attended the first workshop developed eight courses in total, and were asked to commit to teaching those courses no later than fall 2012. The workshop—which Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis described as ""productive beyond my expectations""— was led by Spanish professor Patricia Grieve, the chair of the Committee on the Global Core. Columbia College students are required to take two Global Core classes, a requirement instituted in fall 2008 to replace the old Major Cultures requirement. The list of Global Core classes has been in a state of flux since then, and a major focus of theworkshop was refining what exactly the Global Core should be. ""We don't want to publicize a single template of what a Global Core course should look like,"" Grieve said. Grieve said that the ideal Global Core course should be multidisciplinary, with a focus on primary texts or artifacts, and should either be seminar-style or a lecture that has small discussion sections. Professors are also being encouraged to develop courses that are team-taught, and which feature some subject matter that spans different eras and geographical locations. But Grieve noted that a specific model for what a Global Core class should be has not been developed, emphasizing that there will probably never be a ""single class that all ColumbiaCollege students should take"" in the vein of Lit Hum or CC. But the current Global Core model has come under fire. East Asian studies professor William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, MA '4B, Ph.D '53, who has taught at Columbia since 1949, said that all Global Core classes should be modeled after the Western Core courses. ""What format of education is best suited to getting students best included in the learning process? Not large lectures,"" he said. While Global Core classes such as Asian Civilization, which de Bary teaches, are modeled after Lit Hum and CC, they are buried among large lecture courses that also satisfy the Global Core requirement, he said. ""Since the Global Core requirements have been stretchedout so far, it's a meaningless requirement,"" he said. Grieve also said, though, that it would be too expensive to remove all large lectures from the Global Core list. ""Because of fiscal realities, the number of faculty, number of grad students, and the number of students we can't just have a requirement met only by seminars,"" Grieve said. ""But we can ask that a large class have smaller discussion sections."" The Major Cultures requirement consisted of courses that were strictly non-Western, to contrast the Western-only Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses, according to Classics professor Stathis Gourgouris. Gourgouris, a member of the Global Core committee and aworkshop attendee, said that the Global Core is meant to deal with the intersection of Western and non-Western cultures. ""Global is precisely about the fact that things are intertwined and not separated,"" Gourgouris said. Grieve explained that while many of the courses currently on the Global Core list do not satisfy the new guidelines for Global Core classes, they must remain on the list to satisfy student demand. 'We have [large lecture] courses on the list, but when you have student demand that exceeds what we can do realistically, you have to make a choice as to whether the small class matters more than the availability of a particular subject matter,"" she said. news@columbiaspectator.com"
40,Global Core,Faculty calls for more involvement in Core decisions,14 November 2011,"BY JEREMY BUDD Columbia Daily SpectatorIn 1991, when the faculty of Columbia College was folded into the newly-formed Faculty of Arts and Sciences, longtime professor William Theodore de Bary started to worry about the Core Curriculum. ""It had a terrible effect,"" said de Bary, CC '4l, MA '4B, Ph.D '53, who has taught at Columbia since 1949. ""Nobody took responsibility for the Core."" The CC faculty has never been formally disbanded, but it no longer holds meetings or has any functions. And amid ongoing discussion about the health of the Core—sparked in part by philosophy professor Michele Moody-Adams' resignation as CC dean in August—professors and administrators are asking whether faculty need to find new ways to take ownership of the Core. Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks, who is also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said that FAS has not been able to take the place of the CC faculty. ""The Faculty of Arts and Sciences should have assumed the responsibilities of the schools it took over,"" he said. ""I would like to see them take over interests that the College [faculty] involved itself with."" According to de Bary, before FAS was created, the CC faculty would hold monthly public meetings, and would host ""smokers,"" evening meetings where faculty would gather to discuss issues about the practice of the Core, in between the meetings to discuss the content of the Core.""It was a constant discussion among college faculty,"" de Bary said. ""The people teaching it should have a vote in the direction and conduct of the Core."" FAS holds a two-hour allfaculty meeting once per semester. De Bary described FAS as more of a faculty interest group than an academic body, and said that the Core is rarely discussed at its meetings. ""Meetings consist of receiving reports from central administration and other opinions concerned of the faculty unions,"" he said. One of the few venues for faculty to affect the Core is the Committee on the Core Curriculum, which was created in 1988. The committee has 12 faculty members—the chairs of the different Core classes and several administrators, including the CC dean. It also has student members, including Barry Weinberg, CC 'l2. ""The committee ... deals with broad issues, like should Frontiers of Science be a Core class, what sort of supportsystems we should have for the Core classes, can we coordinate between classes, so that's essentially what this body does,"" Weinberg said. There are also committees to oversee the individual Core classes. The Committee on the Global Core, in particular, gives many faculty the chance to get involved—because Global Core classes aren't limited to professors with particular specialties, like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations are—but many professors remain uninterested, according to Classics professor Stathis Gourgouris, a member of the Global Core committee. This committee is responsible for overseeing proposals for Global Core courses each year. ""I do think faculty as a whole should become more involved with issues about the Core,"" Gourgouris said. ""The more faculty involvement would mean that the way the Core is done or what it is would have to encounter more opinions."" To foster more involvement, de Bary has proposed the creation of an independent ""corps"" of faculty members who wish to discuss issues that affect the Core and increase the transparency of the decision-making process. He said he pitched the idea to University President Lee Bollinger earlier in the semester, but that Bollinger was hesitant to endorse it.Outside of the Core committees, several administrators are involved in Core deci-sion-making, including Dirks, who works with departments to convince professors to teach in the Core. Professor Roosevelt Montas, CC '95, M.A. '96, Ph.D 'O4, is the director of the Center for the Core Curriculum, the administrative body of the Core, as well as a member of the Committee on the Core. Montas called the decisionmaking process in the Core ""tremendously complicated,"" and said he would like more faculty to get involved. ""I teach in the Core, but my job is to administer courses and participate in conversations that determine policy."" Montas said. ""Discussions have dealt with the Global Core, Frontiers of Science, and issues of academic integrity within the Core. Those were the big issues in committee last year."" He added that the chairs of Core classes are frequently responsible for decisions that affect their respective courses. University Writing chair Nicole Wallack, an English professor, and Lit Hum chair Christia Mercer, a philosophy professor, both said they would like more faculty input in the decision-making process. That involvement could constitute just teaching Core classes, professors said. Wallack explained that while she is responsible for selecting texts that are used in UW and the sequence of assignments, each UW instructor is given discretion to select additional readings, and Mercer noted that all Lit Hum instructors are responsible for selecting and voting on a version of the final exam. ""We've been rethinking the curriculum and developing UWriting with the Committee on the Core,"" Wallack said.

41,Global Core,Core may soon travel abroad,9 December 2011,"BY SHAYNA ORENS Columbia Daily SpectatorIt might not be long before Columbia students are reading Rousseau in France, Don Quixote in Spain, or maybe even both in Japan. An initiative to bring Core Curriculum classes taught by Columbia professors to study abroad locations is underway in the Office of Academic Affairs. ""The idea has floated around for a while,"" Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said. ""It's taking more of a shape.""This initiative could potentially create sections of Lit Hum, CC, Art Hum, and Music Hum abroad, making it easier for Columbia College students to study abroad before their junior years. Brenda Salinas, CC 'l2, spent last fall in Paris and said she feels that offering Lit Hum or CC abroad might relieve a lot of pressure for Columbia students who struggle to finish core requirements prior to study abroad. ""It would be great to do it early on. Being in a different context made me think about what I really wanted to do anda semester away from Columbia made me more engaged when I came back,"" Salinas said. She added that for this initiative to make sense, faculty must keep certain factors in mind. ""I think they should take each different place into account and say, 'How can we use the core in this place to get the most out of it?""' Salinas said. But other students said they weren't sure about taking the Core on the road.""It's a stress to get all the core requirements done and also go abroad,"" Katherine Marshall, CC 'l2 said. ""But if it lets more people go abroad, it's a good thing. In terms of how it would enhance the experience, it's a logical disconnect for me."" Marshall said she feels that the curriculum would need to somehow ""align with the cultural context"" to make sense. Yatrakis, however, said that putting the core in a different cultural context might make all the sense in the world.""I think it could mean an even richer experience of combining what has been the intellectual signature of Columbia College, which is the Core, with a new and very different educational and pedagogical experience that students would have in a different culture, even possibly in a different language,"" Yatrakis said. Gillian Rhodes, CC 'l2, is a dance major and spent last year at Columbia's study abroad center in Paris, Reid Hall. She said that she only took the classes atReid Hall that were required and spent the majority of her time immersing herself in the vibrant dance culture of Paris. ""I really wanted to experience life and culture and not get too involved in academics,"" Rhodes said. ""I'm not convinced that I would have taken core classes had they been offered."" According to Yatrakis, the potential for cultural enrichment works both ways. 'You could even imagine, and I think this is very exciting for the faculty, that you teach a coreclass, but in addition, you would co-teach a class with a colleague in the local university—a course that you designed collaboratively,"" Yatrakis said. 'You trade ways of teaching and intellectual viewpoints, and you share this with students of both countries."" Yatrakis said she doesn't dismiss the idea of bringing classes like CC to locations where the texts are not as culturally relevant. She said that it would be interesting to critically analyze Western texts from another perspective, just as it would beacademically stimulating to be immersed in a culture while taking Global Core classes. ""It would be so interesting to have a Global Core class taught by someone familiar with East and West perspectives,"" Yatrakis said. As for now, the initiative is beginning to solidify. ""It's just the beginning of this conversation,"" Yatrakis said. ""But a number of professors have said that this is an idea worth pursuing."" news@columbiaspectator.com""You trade ways of teaching and intellectual viewpoints, and you share this with students of both countries."" —Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis"
42,Global Core,Fifth-year study abroad program to be offered next fall,18 January 2012,"BY MELISSA VON MAYRHAUSER Spectator Senior Staff WriterSeniors graduating this May will have the chance to spend a fifth year in school, traversing Columbia's network of seven global centers and doing research projects. Up to 10 students could be accepted to the new Fifth-Year Fellows program, which will emphasize the liberal arts over career specialization. The price tag for the program will be roughly $40,000, although admission is need-blind and there will be financial aid. Between October and March, participating students will spend time at several of Columbia's global centers—located in Nairobi, Beijing, Paris, Istanbul, Santiago, Amman, and Mumbai—depending on their research interests. Theprogram, which is open to students in Columbia College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of General Studies, will be bookended by on-campus seminars in September, April, and May. Vice President for Global Centers Ken Prewitt, who worked on the program with history professor Charles Armstrong, anthropology professor Rosalind Morris, and English professor Gayatri Spivak, said the program is part of the University's effort to res-, spond To' glbbalizatibri by internationalizing its educational program. ""The global centers themselves are a platform to help facilitate, in effect, a new educational philosophy for the conditions of the 21st century,"" Prewitt said. According to Morris, part of that international philosophy isproviding a strong liberal arts education, rather than beingtoo concerned with career competitiveness. Fifth-year fellows will receive a certificate at the end of the program, not a degree. ""We do not think of it as mere job training, and we do not think of education as that which is limited to market value,"" Morris said in an email. ""For those who are only interested in enhancing their capital for the market, this is probably not a good program."" Morris added that fifth-year fellows will use the year abroad to evaluate the Core Curriculum, and that their feedback on the Core might impact the way professors teach it to future students. ""[The program] is also intended as a vehicle through which [the Core] curriculum can be re-activated,"" Morris said. ""It will also help us to reflect on the relevance of the Core, so that wecan consider ways of enhancing it."" Students said the program could be a chance to internationalize and add depth to their Core experiences. ""I think the program's international travel is interesting because a lot of the Core is Western-based,"" Allison Scott, CC 'l5, said. ""They have Global Core, but it's not really that much outside the West."" Kofi Opoku, SEAS 'l4, said the ability to study at different global centers would be a welcome ""addition to the Global Core. ""If they'll find a way to incorporate [the program] into the Core, I think that a lot of people will take advantage of that,"" Opoku said. Some students, though, are worried that the program would just force them to put off findinga post-graduation job, especially in a time of economic uncertainty. Adwoa Banful, CC 'l3, said that she would consider participating in the program, but only if she could also remain focused on her career. Columbia, she added, might help interested students do that. ""Let's say they could work with CCE [the Center for Career Education] to get people on track to getting a job after they finish so that it's not neglected—justso people would be a little less concerned about what happens after,"" she said. Administrators have not yet released detailed information about the cost of the program, and some students are questioning whether paying tens of thousands for a fifth year of liberal arts education is worth it. Prewitt, in a Bwog comment that he confirmed he wrote last month, rejected the idea that the program is a Columbia scheme to make money. ""If you actually believe that [the University] paying allexpenses for a year overseas ... can, at s4ok a person, make a profit, we haven't educated you very well,"" Prewitt wrote. Prewitt also clarified that qualified students will receive financial aid from the University, possibly for plane tickets, food, and housing. ""We don't want this to be a program only for those with the luxury to afford it,"" Armstrong said. ""We just haven't gotten into quite the nitty gritty of where this aid would go."" melissa.vonmayrhauser @columbiaspectator.comGLOBETROTTING I VP for Global Centers Ken Prewitt helped design the fifth-year program."
43,Global Core,"STAFF EDITORIAL New committee, new power structure",15 February 2012,"New committee, new power structureIn a Spectrum interview last Thursday (""Your daily dose of Deantini,"" Feb. 11), Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini hinted at the creation of an Educational Policy and Planning Committee as recommended by the Task Force on Undergraduate Education in its April 2009 report. According to the report, the EPPC would be formed with ""the belief that undergraduate liberal arts education is a central mission of the Arts and Sciences at Columbia."" The report justifies its recommendation by stating that the University has ""historically lacked a well-established institutional structure"" to plan for undergraduate education, graduate instruction, and faculty development ""in relation to one another."" Almost two years after the report was published, it is encouraging to see that the University is finally looking to implement the TFUE's recommendations and concretely address what seems to be a valid concern. Recent events such as the resignation of former dean Michelle MoodyAdams and professor Andrew Delbanco's lecture regarding the status of Columbia College appear to validate the task force's concerns. Both events indicate that the University needs to improve the manner in which it handles administrative processes. When handled well, administrative woes should not distract from the University's primary educational and research mission. This year at least, we have focused on the administration too much. Thus we welcome the decision on the part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as recognition of major concerns that have repeatedly distracted the University from its primary mission. We acknowledge that there has been no official word on how the committee will function or what its powers will amount to. However, the proposed structure of the committee gives reason for pause. If the report's recommendations are fully carried out, the committee would include the vice president of FAS, dean of CC, dean of the School of General Studies, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, chair of the Committee on the Core, chair of the Committee on Global Core, and chair of the Committee on Instruction for SEAS. Finally, the vice president of FAS will appoint a faculty chair and three additional members of the faculty. We take issue with having the vice president of FAS appoint all four faculty members of the committee. Vice President Dirks unquestionably has the right to sit on the committee himself, and we recognize that he has a level of faculty perspective as a professor of anthropology. However, we believe that his expansive role as an administrator, and the multiple interests he must balance, present a conflict when making decisions that should, ideally, most benefit the curriculum. His influence should therefore be balanced by, rather than be superior to, his fellow faculty members. If the committee is to have significant influence over the faculty members, it is only just that they directly select their representatives, rather than surrendering that authority to the vice president of FAS. We are also uneasy about the lack of student involvement, but we acknowledge that it is difficult to comment without knowing more about the extent of the committee's powers. We are glad to see, however, that Dean Valentini has indicated support for including students. There is positive potential for the EPPC to be a solution to a wide variety of problems that have put the administration at odds with the students and the faculty. However, the proposed appointment structure is an unnecessary and counterproductive centralization of authority in the office of the vice president of FAS. In the past semester, faculty members have raised their voices and have shown us more than ever before that they want more control over the leadership and direction of the University. We ought to give them a direct stake when there are new power structures being put in place."
44,Global Core,They're shooting at us,16 February 2012,"I got into a fight in class last week. In four years, I've had my share of disagreements, academic and otherwise— I've smiled agreeably through the Marx sessions of Contemporary Civilization, and as editor-in-chief, I defended 132 editions of Spectator from charges of racism, sexism, and plain old dishonesty. I didn't think an objectionable point about forms of government had the power to raise my hackles. But I've never swung like that before at Columbia. I argued dirty. I was out for blood. I may have invented a piece of French history. What got into me? Maybe it was a little Light Blue spirit. For decades, even as our financial and academic fortunes have waned and then waxed again, Columbia has distinguished itself among prominent American universities for its students' and faculty's unceasing eagerness to leap into the fray and fight the issues of the day. What Vietnam and civil rights were to the 1960s here was apartheid in the 1980s, expansion in 2006, and ROTC in 2011. When Jim Gilchrist, the border security activist, appeared on campus six years ago, protesters stampeded him off the stage, leading to a physical brawl between supporters and opponents of his controversial message. He recently declined to make a return visit. ""It seems pointless to speak to a campus where witch-hunters of free speech so often dictate, through intimidation and disruption, who will be allowed to participate in liberty and who will not,"" he wrote. Gilchrist probably decided that he couldn't garner enough attention for himself at Columbia, not that it was time to make a sacrifice for freedom. But the point stands: Do we, in our endless internecine fights over politics and identities and colonies and wealth, make things better? Five years ago, seven students and one professor stopped eating for over a week to change the study of global cultures here. The Global Core remains an insubstantial appendage to the undergraduate curriculum. For half a decade, students, alumni, local residents, and faculty who opposed the Manhattanville campus mounted a massive campaign to limit the University's ambitions. They failed. Was it all worth it? Henry Coleman was an administrator at Columbia from 1958 to 1979. The second most significant moment in his lengthy tenure was the Tuesday afternoon when a student, thought to have been a sophomore who had been suspended for bad grades, brought a gun into Hamilton Hall and shot Coleman six times in his chest, arm, andjaw. Regardless of how we judge the hunger strikers, antiexpansionists, or even the 1960s campus occupiers, we acknowledge that they fought for something greater than themselves and their own interests. But a good cause isn't always enough. In fall 2009, the College Republicans invited Geert Wilders, a Dutch politician who had faced international censure for his opposition to the Muslim faith, to speak on campus. The College Republicans were promised that Wilders would discuss free speech, not religion. They were misled. In front of a tensely quiet room, Wilders said some of the most profoundly offensive things I've had the misfortune to hear at Columbia. Members of the audience who tried to challenge him in the Q&A were cut off. Wilders' appearance sparked a small firestorm of debate about anti-Islamic prejudice and European immigration. Nobody on any side learned anything that fall, except perhaps for man's capacity for inhumanity toward his fellow man. What was launched in the good cause of free speech had ended in a ridiculous show and a fight. That said, while I'll try to keep my cool in class, I can't condemn those of you who wage wars between Broadway and Amsterdam. We are animated today by the memories of fights past. With a cohort of intelligent, engaged students, brought together with brilliant faculty, rich tradition, and history, a good cause produces something greater than the sum of the parts. And I have to think that when classroom chatter turns heated, it's because we are aware of how hard our forebears here fought for what they believed in. We have an unspoken sense that what we say, do, and think matters because of them. In late 1814, as British troops burned the White House and an invasion of New York seemed imminent, a group of Columbia College students and alumni organized to protect the city. Marching north from Columbia's 19th-century campus on 49th Street, the volunteers fortified a part of northern Manhattan that was then called Harlem Heights. Near the dawn of the 20th century, Columbia would move uptown to the site its graduates had.defended 90 years before. A group of SEAS faculty, with no medical training, put Coleman into a borrowed station wagon and drove him to St. Luke's Hospital. He survived. The campus emergency medical squad that got its first vehicle that day is now known as CAVA. And even after a group of student radicals took him hostage in April 1968, Coleman still saw to it that they got into law school. Perhaps, someday, we'll lay down our arms. Samuel E.

45,Global Core,The Canon,7 March 2012,How should non-Western traditions feature in the Core Curriculum? Is the Global Core adequate?
46,Global Core,STAFF EDITORIAL Extending our Core,7 March 2012,"Extending our CoreRecently, administrators, faculty members, and alumni have been discussing a broadbased fundraising initiative to endow the Core Curriculum. Although the endowment could aim to stabilize the Core in the long term, the practical uses of the money are still up for debate. As talks continue, we should not only focus on strengthening the Core financially, but also look to augment the curriculum itself. One obvious objective should be improving the Global Core requirement. The main goal of the Core Curriculum is to give us a foundation in Western thought and, through an exploration of the Western canon, allow us to better understand and interact with the modern Western world. Still, we should engage with non-Western thought on an equal footing so as to challenge established Western beliefs and begin to acquire an ability to interact with an increasingly globalizing world. The Global Core should—as a counterpart to the rest of the Core—provide a foundation in non-Western thought. The Global Core was introduced in 1988 as the Major Cultures requirement, after professor William Theodore de Bary released his report on the Core Curriculum. Although de Bary recommended a seminar format, the Major Cultures requirement consisted mostly of lecture classes in specific departments. With the infamous hunger strikes of 2007, students sought to amend the flawed Major Cultures requirement, and the administration promised to look into reforming it into a single mandatory seminar class. In 2008, Major Cultures was renamed the Global Core, yet the ""extended core"" remained as flawed and ineffective as before. The current Global Core is superficial and peripheral in nature. Rather than seeking to provide an alternate foundation to challenge Western thinking, it offers disparate and de-partment-oriented courses, such as Salsa, Soca, and Reggae, alongside broader classes like Asian Humanities. Unlike the foundational Western courses of the Core Curriculum, the vast majority of courses that fulfill the Global Core requirement do not draw from a body of classical works that underpin a mode of thinking. They do not provide the foundation that a core class should. ""That's what is the trouble with the present Global Core: it's too indiscriminate,"" de Bary told Spectator. ""It's all over the place. It has no core. It has a specious globality, but it has no core."" While logistical hurdles prevent the Global Core from being as extensive as the Western | core, which extends to literature, philosophy, art, and music, the Core Curriculum would benefit from a non-Western equivalent of the Core's flagship course, Contemporary Civilization. The Global Core should seek to provide a foundation in non-Western political thought parallel to CC, laying a groundwork for an exploration of nonWestern cultures and providing an alternative to Western thought, along with cultures that draw from the intersection of the West and the East. A class modeled after Asian Humanities is readily available and would provide that groundwork. We must also acknowledge that the nature of such a course might be limited and imperfect. As de Bary noted, the very nature of a civilization is a recent construct. Yet more practically, a core class is limited to the study of literary texts and not all civilizations are based in literary traditions. In de Bary's view, the two traditions that should feature in the Core are the Western tradition and the Eastern tradition—that of East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East—because they have developed out of ""literary civilizations."" We do not reject the value of non-literary traditions, nor do we see them as inferior. Rather, the literary nature of the modern university limits us to literary scholarship. To carry out an exploration of non-literary cultures is simply not feasible as part of a core, as it would require an entirely new course structure. A natural question arises: What about a LatinAmerican or African canon? Given that we do not have access to classical literary artifacts from Latin America or Africa, there are inherent problems in constructing these canons. Yet if we can understand both the fundamentals of Western and Eastern thought, we have the capability to better explore most cultures and schools of thought in the modern world. With a Global Core seminar modeled after Asian Humanities, the principles of the Core would be preserved. As with Lit Hum and CC, every student would be taking the same class designed to spark discussion and a common experience, a characteristic essential to the Core. Furthermore, the class would provide a ""core"" of knowledge, rather than random, auxiliary classes, as the Global Core does today. By providing a foundation in the Eastern canon, the Global Core would provide a basis for all students to understand that there are alternatives to Western thinking. Creating a centralized, uniform Global Core may seem daunting given administrative considerations, but given the increased attention being paid to the Core as the foundation of the Columbia College experience, it is a possibility. More specific details, such as when the course would be taken, how many semesters it would be, and whether it would be separated into several courses, would have to be fleshed out. But as undergraduates, we recognize the constant need to rethink the structure of the Core. With an endowment for the Core on the horizon, it is time to think about its global component."
47,Global Core,Argue but obey,7 March 2012,"Wasif Jawhariyeh was born in Jerusalem in the late Ottoman period, at a time when the city was incredibly dynamic, with Christians, Jews, and Muslims living in a symbiosis almost unimaginable given today's tense geopolitical climate. French, English, and German missionaries, administrators, and businessmen had become part of a newfangled landscape of tramways, automobiles, and telephone poles. From this ooze of proto-glo-balization, Wasif, the son of a prominent Eastern Orthodox community leader and lawyer, emerged to become one of Palestine's preeminent lute players. His unique ability to incorporate Western rhythms and melodies into his masterful performances earned him widespread recognition and acclaim. At age nine, Wasif entered a Lutheran school where he was instructed in Arabic grammar, arithmetic, and Bible recitation. He then went on to the Dusturiya National School, where he learned English, French, and Turkish, and took a course designed to introduce the Quran to Christians. Switching schools once more, he mastered the English language. Having completed his education on the eve of World War I, Wasif entered cosmopolitan Jerusalem with a firm grasp of the many cultures that colored the dynamic city. This account has stuck with me because it feels so modern in its premise. It is humbling to realizethat notions of a ""global"" education are at least a century old, if not plainly inherited from more ancient traditions. Yet despite the timelessness of such pursuits, we continue to remain uncertain as to the purpose of a global education and the form it should take. Wasif, vacillating between numerous languages, intellectual traditions, and institutions of learning, was seemingly on sure footing as he and his contemporaries pursued their educations. We seem to lack the same fortitude—at once compelled to seek a global outlook, but also uncomfortable with embracing foreign perspectives. The uncomfortable middle ground we occupy, with all its intellectual pitfalls, is endemic to the American university. Diagnosing why we are in this predicament is a difficult task, but one aspect of Wasif's experience explains his cosmopolitan education. At the time of his upbringing, many trappings of the nationstate had not yet reached the Middle East A central characteristic of the nation-state is its use of education as a tool to craft a national ideology in order to form a loyal citizenry. In the late Ottoman Empire, identity and ideology were determined organically, and at ground level, no one tradition was privileged through channels of hierarchical political ordering. As a result, Wasif and his contemporaries had total latitude to constitute their identities through a multi-faceted education. In the Jerusalem of long ago, the default position of education was one where the individual was expected to pursue learning through multiple traditions in order to enable fruitful interactions in multicultural communities. In present-day America, we are pushed to learn a single privileged tradition before all others. This condition is unavoidable, at least untilsomeone figures out how to float Columbia on the high seas, relocate it to the Antarctic, or jettison the campus into orbit It is fruitless to imagine that a Global Core, however well articulated or rich in its offerings, could counteract the deep structures of education in the modern nation-state. Nor should we go so for as to say that the idea of a distinctly American education is defunct, despite its strictures. A strong, cohesive national identity is a necessity for collective action, even in a globalized world. If anything, the Global Core, the process of learning non-Western traditions, ought to remind us that our educations should be of the ideologically freewheeling type that Wasif was privileged to enjoy. The Global Core goes some way toward satisfying this need. But it is simply not in the interest of the University or the nation at large to give Western and non-Western perspectives equal billing. A neutral education is the most Utopian of dreams. Despite all of this, there is something wonderful and redeeming about the fact that we are even asking the question. It speaks to both the accommodating nature of American identity and to the intellectual courage of our university. It is unlikely that Columbia will definitively resolve the question of how to feature non-Western traditions at the institutional level. This is probably because it is impossible to return to the freedom of thought that existed before the arrival of modern political realities. Even Kant, a stalwart for intellectual freedom, concedes that in the face of sovereign power, ""Argue as much as you want and about what you want, but obey!""

48,Global Core,The core of Global Core,7 March 2012,
49,Global Core,Inconsistent West,7 March 2012,"BY FELICIA BISHOPThis campus consistently proves hostile to students and faculty members who resist the pedagogy that undergirds Western-based curricula. Instead of critically engaging with the material presented at the recent CCSC Core forum, /for example, one Contemporary Civilization professor assured his class that the dissenters ""just don't understand the purpose of the Core."" Although this dismissive response is white noise to activists who organize around the idea of intellectual violence, I want to take the time to unpack the conceptions of power and hierarchy that enable it, and, more importantly, the pedagogical inconsistencies it reveals. We need to begin conceptualizing and discussing education as a means ofboth preparing and disciplining bodies and minds for a particular social, political, and economic landscape. When we begin to understand education as a means of induction, the politics of inclusion becomes more charged. Chosen material is marked as valuable in these processes of preparation and discipline. What is excluded, then, must either be irrelevant or dangerous. ""This is a course on Western Civilization, so it makes sense that other people aren't included,"" one student at the forum concluded. What I don't understand is how intellectuals trained in the Western intellectual tradition are systematically excluded or, perhaps worse, rendered optional. Albert Memmi, Richard Delgado, Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Catherine Mackinnon, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston. These intellectuals have made foundational artistic and philosophical contributions to Western thought They were trained in Western schools. To exclude them is to attempt to preserve an obsolete conception of the 'West"" that was achieved through suppression and oppression. What people just don't understand is that the 'West"" is a conceptual construct much like any other, attempting to delineate—in a classed, gendered, and racialized way—who belongs and who doesn't We've come to that critical point though, where the West"" is denying the very intellectuals and thought it has created. This brings me to my critique of the Global Core. Its not surprising, to begin with, that courses focusing on marginalized identities of the West do not fulfill the requirement African-American, Asian-American, and Latino-centered courses don't satisfy our growing global and cultural fetishism. To write these people of the Americas into the Core, in any capacity, would begin to problematize the very binary between West and non-West that it aims to sustain. These kinds of inconsistencies need to be more ardently critiqued. How, then, do we richly and critically engage with ""non-Western"" traditions? I do think we should remain faithful to the design of the Core in our engagements. Literature and philosophy should be the realms in which we rigorously work through other global traditions. Thinking that African Art achieves what CC or Lit Hum does is to suggest that foundational literary and philosophical canons can be replaced by any kind of cultural exploration. There is a reason CC is the linchpin of our education, one of the most academically celebrated elements of who we are as a university. That the Global Core is framed, and often understood, as a ""cultural"" venture reproduces the power dynamics that it is purportedly meant to disrupt An authentic commitment to rigor and respect would mean entirely redesigning the Core to include a series of sequences that mirror Lit Hum and CC for nonWestern intellectual traditions. The shortcomings of the Global Core cannot be addressed by alteration alone. It means re-conceptualiz-ing the idea of the West to make it representative of the people and thought it actually includes. It means being honest about how the 'West"" has changed and who is responsible for these changes. It means recognizing cultural voyeurism as reproducing asymmetrical power dynamics. It means giving power and resources to marginalized and underfunded departments. It means recognizing that the suggestion we ""just don't"" understand the purpose of the Core is really a way of preserving intellectual hierarchies and dangerously depoliticizing our educations.

50,Global Core,10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE GLOBAL CENTERS,30 March 2012,"1. Columbia launched its first two global centers in Amman, Jordan and Beijing, China in March 2009. 2. The Beijing Center has not had a director since Xiao Geng stepped down in mid-2011, but administrators are actively searching for one. The center received over 100 applications and now has a short list of about half a dozen finalists. 3. University President Lee Bollinger told Spectator that Columbia is considering opening a global center in West Africa. Vice President for Global Centers Ken Prewitt mentioned Dakar and Johannesburg as possible locations for an Africa center in January. 4. In most cases, a new global center has both a launch ceremony and an opening ceremony. A launch establishes ties with the regional community and government, and those relationships are formalized during the opening ceremony. The Nairobi center's launch was in February, but it has not officially opened yet. 5. Columbia originally considered Sao Paulo before choosing Rio de Janeiro as the site of its Brazil global center. ""We started in Sao Paulo, the financial capital and increasingly the cultural capital, and we were encouraged, but nothing specific came out of those conversations,"" said Thomas Trebat, who will soon become the Rio de Janeiro center's first director. Nairobi global center director Belay Begashaw said that because of the center, African leaders are turning to Columbia scholars rather than the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for economic advice. 7. The average cost of running eight centers is $6-7 million per year, according to Prewitt. Some administrators have suggested that the global centers could become part of Columbia's Global Core curriculum. As Prewitt said, ""I think the Core questions are the right questions, but I don't think you can understand them if you only understand them in the Western tradition."" 9. The Amman global center, which received its 45,000-square-foot building from the Jordanian king and queen, faced a shake-up during the Arab Spring. ""We are already now dealing with a prime minister and several ministers who are different from the ones we started working with,"" Prewitt said. 10. ""The number of alumni who have attended events at the centers is more than 2,000,"" Prewitt said. ""That was 0 in 2008.""I GRAPHIC BY YUMA SHINOHARA AND MELISSA VON MAYRHAUSER"
51,Global Core,Help nominate the new Columbia College dean,11 April 2012,"BY ALEX JASIULEKNow that the time has come to select a new dean of Columbia College, I urge students to participate in the process. We need more than transparency during the committee's search. It is students' responsibility to give critical feedback in the process. Austin Quigley was the dean of Columbia College for 14 years, and whichever dean is chosen could last as long if not longer in that position. We currently have until April 15 (half a week) to produce a list of candidates from which the committee will appoint a dean that could be here long after we have graduated and gone off into the world as alumni. Being complacent is not an option since our previous dean, Michele Moody-Adams, resigned due to upcoming changes that she deemed would ""compromise the college's academic quality and financial health."" As current students invested in the long-term health of our school, we must nominate. As issues arise over the next years like the Core Curriculum endowment, physical expansion, and other changes that we can only speculate about, it is important that we have a dean who is willing to go to bat for students on the most important issues. If students do not participate in the process, then it is very likely that there will be a shortlist of candidates who are not willing to dissent against the central administration. When making my nomination, I expect the candidate to understand the diverse interests of students on campus and be critically engaged with the academic experience of undergraduates. My candidate will push for a Core that interrogates the notion of western civilization and global history in an era that fundamentally challenges those categories. This naturally must be coupled with support of a more dynamic and structured Global Core. My candidate will support greater emphasis on marginalized studies like ethnic, African-American, women and gender, etc. My candidate will not sit idly by when student privacy is violated by the New York Police Department or when issues of the college's long-term health arise. Lastly, my candidate will demand ethical expansion both in Harlem and around the globe as the University continues to grow. These issues matter to me as a student havingwitnessed the ongoing hate between Columbia College students and those at Barnard, General Studies, and School of Engineering and Applied Science, as well as the many bias incidents in the past years and community agitation over labor and land disputes. Students need to have a stronger background in social sciences and identity studies if we are to better engage with each other civilly and improve our world at large. We must also be aware of our impact on our extended communities and act in a way that benefits all. While these issues matter to me and many other students from identity-based, social justice, and political groups on campus, there are other positions important to students that I do not know how to voice. These voices must be heard for the selection committee to best represent all student interests. Additionally, the student council of Columbia College will be submitting a resolution that gives minimum expectations to the incoming dean like meeting regularly with students, attending campus events, maintaining transparency, and fighting for students' rights. This year we noticed a sloppy transition process that, despite Dean James Valentini's good faith, will be utterly unacceptable in the incoming year. Students must hold the incoming dean accountable for meeting basic requirements while taking the initiative to improve undergraduate life. The best way to ensure this is by nominating the right candidates. So again I urge you, it takes 15 minutes to write a letter explaining who you would like to be dean and what qualities they hold that makes them fit to lead our school for the years to come. In these 15 minutes you might be providing the support a faculty member needs to be chosen out of the pool of applicants the committee will be reviewing. Whether you will be graduating this year or not, or even if you have already graduated, take the time to think about what this school needs and who can help make the positive change that you are looking for. Then send an email to nominations@columbia.edu. The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science and comparative ethnic studies.

52,Global Core,OPINION,13 April 2012,PAGE 4Meaning behind the Matzo Jessica Hills examines the Passover Seder's contemporary significance. Intercultural Core Professor Rachel Chung on the role of the Global Core in a global world.
53,Global Core,Toward a true global core,13 April 2012,"BY RACHEL E. CHUNGIn 2008, Columbia hosted an international conference on Global Core curriculum, which drew much attention to our historical role in shaping die direction of global core worldwide. As we continue in the struggle to find the right approach and balance within our own Global Core—which I will abbreviate as GC—it occurred to me that GC carries enormous ramifications for the standing of the University as a whole within the global community, touching everything from the success of the new global centers to Columbia's ability to represent future leadership of the ""American university."" It also occurred to me that the solution to our struggle rests not in structural or curricular changes, but in rethinking the pedagogy. Our students will soon be living in a time when it will be increasingly meaningless to speak of a Western Core or indeed even of ""the West' without having global consciousness front and center. In some circles, the word ""global"" has become a kind of ""non-speak"" lately, but in my view that's only because 1) we've become used to a very one-sided view of history, 2) we tend to equate globalization with inevitable syncretism and loss of local identity, and 3) most of all, because we haven't clearly distinguished between multicultural consciousness and global consciousness. ""Global"" is a very different animal than ""multicultural."" Columbia was among the first universities to recognize theEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome. core-ness of learning about other civilizations, but for all that, our non-Western Core has been more or less ornamental addons to what is frequently regarded as the ""core of the Core."" For decades, this was fine. If it didn't anticipate the future, at least it reflected a working reality of the world, and it allowed for an educational model prioritizing one's own tradition—whatever one's soil—before going on to learn those of others. If we use the metaphor of ""the Great Conversation,"" Contemporary Civilization imparted to students an awareness of the nature of the ongoing Conversation and an appreciation for the fact that as thinking citizens, they had the right and the responsibility to participate in it. Multicultural Core simply made students aware of the fact that similar Conversations had been going on in other civilizations as well. The struggle within current GC today is that it's still operating on the level of this multicultural Core, and in some cases, watering even that down to what I call ""myculturalism."" ""Global"" is not merely adding more diverse voices or Conversational topics to the fray-though it's open to that, if desired. Rather, global involves a reconceptualizing of civilizational identity as something gotten in isolation through insistent going over-and-over of landmark moments in one's intellectual/cultural development. Rather, global involves an ongoing process of self-transformation made vital by meaningful interaction with other beings, ideas, and things. I call this interaction on the deepest level ""interculturation."" The West did not become ""the West"" on its own. It was shaped from the coming together of Judeo-Christian and GreekRoman worldviews, from the rich infusion of Arab science and knowledge in the Middle Ages, and from Confucianism and Buddhism that inspired the European Enlightenment,etc. Moreover, these interactions didn't have fixed boundaries—i.e., their influence is so deeply saturated that they have become part of the very way we see and think even as individuals, in that sense becoming generative in their own right. And yet to recognize this does not make the West any less the West, just as the saturation of Buddhism in East Asia is understood today as a revitalization of the culture and not syncretism. In locating civilizational identity in a culture's creative receptivity, its ability to absorb new ideas and adapt them for its own contexts, we empower students to consider, with greater range and depth, the creative, regenerative potential and responsibility of interculturation taking place today—going beyond center-periphery categories to develop simultaneously global and local identities. Interculturation, then, is a pedagogy not to dismantle Columbia's Core, but to shift our collective vantage point to see the Great Conversation that has been happening across civilizations, energizing the Conversations that occur within civilizations, and vice versa. A Core founded on interculturation would focus not on learning about the brilliance of the West and diversity of the rest, but on how and what to learn from the civilizations around us, including the West, without losing sight of what has been central and best to one's self. The timelessness of ""core"" is that we have been doing this throughout history. To be timely means turning to learn from their examples as we face the challenges of globalization in our own contexts. It is only in making this shift to global thinking that I believe Columbia can once again continue to lead the future of the American university and of global corenot just Global Core—in higher education internationally.

54,Global Core,Panel considers future of the American college,20 April 2012,"BY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterWhat is the future of the American college? It's uncertain, according to a recent book by Professor Andrew Delbanco, as well as a panel discussion featuring Delbanco and several other students and prominent professors Thursday night. The panel, moderated by Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini, focused on the place of a liberal arts education amid preprofessional pressures. Delbanco's book, ""College: What it Was, Is, and Should Be""—which was published last month—served as a springboard for the discussion. Delbanco, the director of the Center for American Studies, said that the ""idea of college as a place for reflection, a place where you can take a breath—that's not happening very much anymore."" ""This is a mild version of the problem where college is conceptualized as a vocational institution,"" he said. ""They're not endangered institutions, but the question is what kind of place they will become."" Director of the Center for the Core Curriculum Roosevelt Montas and political science professor Ira Katznelson, CC '66—a onetime interim executive vice president for Arts and Sciences—also served on the panel with Ganiatu Afolabi, CC 'l2, and Samuel Roth, CC 'l2 and former Spectator editor in chief. 'When we ask about the future of the college, we're taking about a particular idea of the college that is developed in the American context,"" Montas, CC '95, M.A. '96, and Ph.D. 'O4, said. ""And that is to put at the center of the college the idea of a liberal education. That's pretty uniquein the United States."" • Delbanco discussed some of the issues that he believes students and faculty should be concerned about, including increases in class sizes, the difficulty of staffing courses, and the challenge of navigating complicated university bureaucracies. He talked about similar issues, specifically as they pertain to Columbia College, in an on-cam-pus speech in October. ""None of these problems is new, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't complain about them,"" he said. ""That's our job as critics of the present."" The panelists also spent time talking about Columbia specifically. Afolabi said that the administration's lack of transparency concerns her. ""It's really interesting that, in general, we educate students so we can take part in this democracy,"" she said. ""How am I supposed to be a responsible student when I don't even know how the democracy of my own school works?"" One problem at Columbia, Delbanco said, is that several important committees keep their work confidential, limiting public discussions and debate. He cited the Committee onInstruction, which is responsible for approving new courses and reviewing degree requirements, as one example. Still, Delbanco said that some professors remain dedicated to the Core Curriculum. Political science professor emeritus Douglas Chalmers—a member of the Society of Senior Scholarstold the panel that faculty should spend more time refining the Global Core requirement, as students are ""living in a very different world"" than the world that the Core was created in. ""The world is changing. The United States is fading away as a major power,"" he said. ""The West is being confronted with all kinds of new sorts of things—the word is 'globalization.'"" ""The Core Curriculum is kind of stuck on teaching the Western Core and being very prominent,"" he added. ""I think we need to think seriously about how that should change."" Delbanco responded by saying it is ironic that many East Asian universities are considering implementing the fouryear American version of college, rather than the three-year British version. He emphasizedthe importance of discussing the style of the American college. ""My primary motivation is that we need more conversations like this,"" Delbanco said. ""The community that cares about the college should be talking about these issues and not grumbling privately."" Valentini, the moderator, stayed silent for much of the panel. He said that ""the way to have good ideas is to have a lotof ideas, and the way to have a lot of ideas is to have a lot of people thinking,"" but that implementing ideas is always a challenge. ""One does not have to be dean very long to realize that in this community, the porridge is not just too hot or too cold—the porridge needs to be an individual, specific temperature for each of us,"" he said. ""And each person would like the dean to establish that temperature for everyone."" jeremy.budd @co\umbiaspectator.comTHE FUTURE I A panel of prominent professors and students discussed the state of the American college on Thursday evening.CORE QUESTIONS I Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini moderated a panel on the future of the American college."
55,Global Core,ACADEMICS AND THE CORE,7 May 2012,"If the Core Curriculum is to achieve its goal of helping students ""understand the civilization of our own day and participate effectively in it,"" it must take science seriously. The science requirement demands the same focus that is the strength of the rest of the Core Curriculum, and Columbia should begin by requiring an introductory course in probability and statistics for all students. ""Numerically human,"" Jacob Andreas, SEAS 'l2The Global Core should seek to provide a foundation in non-Western political thought parallel to Contemporary Civilization, laying a groundwork for an exploration of non-Western cultures and providing an alternative to Western thought, along with cultures that draw from the intersection of the West and the East. A class modeled after Asian Humanities is readily available and would provide that groundwork. ""Extending our Core,"" the Editorial BoardThe essentia] point is that faculty should measure up to genuine public standards, not just exhibit popular appeal, and in academia the public standard should be educational—neither just academic in the research sense nor grandstanding before a popular audience. ""An active faculty,"" William Theodore de Bary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University, CC '4lEven the most erudite and long-serving professor will not be an expert in all domains of the Core syllabus.

56,Global Core,3 Globalization,27 August 2012,"BY MELISSA VON MAYRHAUSER Spectator Senior Staff WriterColumbia is kicking off several globalization programs this semester, the latest steps in an effort to make a Columbia education a more global experience. In September, the University will launch its newest global center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, adding to a list of centers that already includes Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, and Santiago. University President Lee Bollinger has said that eventually, he wants all students to spend time at the global centers, which serve as research hubs rather than branch campuses. The centers' directors will assemble in New York next month for a conference, as part of newly appointed Vice President for Global Centers Safwan Masri's agenda of increasing communication between the centers and theMorningside Heights community. The directors also plan to speak at the World Leaders Forum, an annual series of events during which heads of state and other international leaders convene at Columbia. Meanwhile, a group of six students participating in a new fifth-year study abroad program will set off on their globe-hopping independent research projects in October. And in March, Barnard will hold a women's leadership symposium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, as part of its ongoing efforts to increase its international reach. Additionally, General Studies students will be required to take Global Core courses for the first time this fall, as students at Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science are already required to do. Committees have also formed to discuss the idea of offering Core Curriculum classes at the global centers. melissa.vonmayrhauser @columbiaspectator.comWELCOME TO JORDAN I Columbia's global center in Amman opened in 2009 under the patronage of Queen Rania A 1 Abdullah."
57,Global Core,Storytelling and the task of the university,7 September 2012,"BY WEN JINRecently, a Chinese press approached me to discuss a possible translation of ""The Anatomy of Influence,"" Harold Bloom's most recent work of criticism, promising that the translation would draw a big audience. Bloom's earlier book, ""The Western Canon,"" has undoubtedly become the most talkedabout English-language work in literary criticism in China, to which the Chinese readers have left a flood of responses on various book sites expressing opinions ranging from admiration to reverence. These opinions echo, and are reinforced by, New York Times Book Review editor Sam Tanenhaus' recent comment in an NYT podcast that ""in the end you kind of come back to the great books"" as well as his claim in an NYT 2011 interview of Bloom that the latter remains the ""most famous and controversial literary critic of our time."" The canon is by no means dead and gone: It acquires more legitimacy and strength through transnational circulation. So, what do we do about the power of the canon? Where does ethnic or minority literature go? The minority writer emerged in the radical 1960s and early 1970s as an important cultural figure, whose position was both cemented and contested in the ensuing culture wars. Is this figure now starting to lose its purchase on the national imagination and academic curricula? Is there a way in today's universities of honoring both our desire to master the great books and our interest in, not to say responsibility toward, what has been left out of them? One telling sign of the difficulties facing non-canon-ical writers is the reconfiguration of Columbia's Core Curriculum. The new concept of the Global Core does not include courses that investigate the workings of race, ethnicity, or other modes of differentiation within a nation. A course on East Asian literature would certainly count toward the Global Core requirement, but it may not shed light either on the ethnic paradigms in Asia or on the racialization of overseas Asians. The idea of world or global literature may well end up enhancing the power of national canons, however we emphasize their permutations through translation.Each Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome. This is not to say that ethnic cultures have lost their pres- • ence on campus. If we just peruse the Center for the Study ■ of Race and Ethnicity's updated calendar of events, we can easily see how the semester will be densely populated with lectures, talks, conferences, and performances featuring ideas related to immigration, ethnicity, and indigeneity. The tussle between general knowledge (associated with! the great books) and specialized pursuits centering on mi-1 nor and minority archives has for a long time been central; to debates on the functions of the university. Should the; university (both the college and the graduate school) focuson imparting broadly acknowledged ideas or excavatingforgotten and neglected ones? Should the university devote! itself to forging the symbolic bonds bringing people together! or fostering plurality among them? There have never been,and should not be, clear-cut answers to these questionsf The university is simply a space for legitimate intellectualdebates and fights. In the end, the university is not an end in itself. It prepares' us for intellectual and practical projects that can never be accomplished within its confines. Melville is the one who claims that ""true places"" are never in the maps. Indeed, a novel like ""Moby Dick"" can never be conceived on the basis of the knowledge acquired in the academy, and yet it tells us much about the task of the university. Reading ""Moby Dick"" makes us wonder why anyone would elaborate tirelessly on whale classification and the drunken bantering of the shipmates in a book devoted to such exalted ideas as the mythical and symbolic meanings of whaling. The author suggests that he wants to tell a grand story in which every part receives ample attention and careful treatment. A goodstory, like a good place, consists of many strange sites that complement the more popular ""attractions."" The university is that which helps launch us on a lifelong project, in a field of our own choosing, that will ultimately depend on the story we would like to create and present tc£ the world. Whoever will be our audience, nothing should take away our ambition to learn how to tell a grand or even universal story brimming with eccentric, oblique details that used to matter to only a few people.

58,Global Core,Keeping things transparent,13 September 2012,"Here's a meaningless statement: I am a member of the Columbia College and School of General Studies Committee on Instruction. Most students have no inkling of what it is or does—myself included. The first I heard of the COI was when I submitted an application for it, having found the link hidden in the subpoint of a Columbia College Student Council email—not exactly the best way to reach and inform students. There is no good reason why a body like the COI should be opaque. On thecontrary, we should know that students (theoretically) have a voice in a group that has decision-making power over the most important aspect of college: academics. We should know that it has the power to approve or reject classes, majors, and entire programs of study. And we should also know that the student representatives (e.g., me) are unelected, and, in practice, have no accountability to CCSC or anyone else. I write about the COI because it's what I'm familiar with, but it is just one of many acronyms in the uncurated mess that is our academic bureaucracy. Have an issue with Frontiers of Science? It's up for review before the COSI (Committee on Science Instruction) this year. Unhappy with the Global Core course offerings? The COGC (Committee on the Global Core) is constantly developing reforms. Think that it's unfair that international admissions are now need-aware? Take it up with the CAFA (Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid). The point is that Columbia has organs that can and do address most of the pressing and perennial issues facing students—only, they are not much use to us if we don't know they exist. It becomes impossible to air grievances or float important reforms in any sort of productive manner, given the obscurity under which much of the University's machinery operates. Take, for instance, our ambivalence towards many aspects of the Core. I do not think I am too far off the mark in saying that we value it and want it to thrive, which is why we, year in and year out, have discussions on how to improve it and keep it relevant. There have been town halls, meetings with individual administrators, and of course late-night conversations in dorm hallways, out of which have come some interesting and promising proposals. We have spoken of removing the Global Core in favor of integrating non-Western texts in an extended version of Contemporary Civilization, of replacing Frontierswith a more rigorous and field-specific introductory science course, of exchanging the current chronological approach to texts for a thematic one. These are all ideas worth further exploration by the community—students, faculty, administration, alumni—yet the furthest they ever seem to get is a quickly-forgotten Bwog post or a note in the minutes of CCSC, for the simple reason that we do not know how to approach those who actually have the power to make these changes. Precisely because it is not clear how our opinions are to be heard, when the administration rolls out policies affecting student life, we can only complain that decisions are made unilaterally, with little thought for us. Whether this is actually the case or not, that we are able to make the assumption in the first place speaks to a dearth of trust between students and the University, hindering productive dialogue and leaving a sour taste in more than a few jaded students' mouths. The whole Columbia community would benefit from increased transparency on the part of the University. There is certainly no shortage of student-interest in participating in the discussions that will make Columbia better, but we need to be given the information and tools to do so. The number of applications for a spot on the newly-formed Educational Policy and Planning Committee (over 60) are indicative in more ways than one, given that we know almost nothing about its real scope or powers besides what faculty, who are themselves unsure, tell us. The operations of any ""committee"" or ""task force"" that could potentially impact student affairs should be made public to students, even if we have no direct representation on the body. Clearly defined roles for advisory and executive committees, greater student involvement in the decision-making process, and public minutes would all improve the tone of discourse—and allow everyone to get more done. The University must make a real effort to engage students in matters relevant to their well-being. There will always be legitimate reasons to keep some firings confidential. The onus, however, should be on the administration to prove why the information should be kept secret, not on the students to prove why they should have access to it. If Columbia is serious about involving all members of its community in academic policy, it should be as transparent as possible. Anything less degrades students' perception of administrators, and makes it impossible to have an intelligent and constructive dialogue.

59,Global Core,Cultural technology,10 October 2012,"Together with the global city, the urban university is on the rise. The long-standing ideal of the cloistered university in the bucolic setting is being supplanted by a new image of the busding institution in the urban setting. Schools such as Columbia, Imperial College London, ETHZurich, and Tsinghua, among others, are reasserting the desirability of the urban setting for globally competitive universities. But what is it about the university that seems to enjoy a symbiosis with the global city? What is the role of the university in these localities? The role of the urban university is to develop what we might call ""cultural technology."" Perhaps unexpectedly, I am borrowing this term from Lee Soo-man, the founder of one of Korea's most successful record labels, and a major force behind the global rise of K-pop (I concede this may seem like an attempt to channel Malcolm Gladwell). In Lee's case, cultural technology is a method of training his musical acts to achieve a ""perfect localization"" no matter the market into which their music and their public personas are introduced. CT, as it is called, is a vast program to hone each artist's image and presentation to match local attitudes while still maintaining the global feel that makes such acts alluring. Whenever Girls' Generation performs in Shanghai or Los Angeles, they are equipped with specific cultural instructions to allow them to maximize their commercial outcomes in particular environments. The comparison between this training and the function of the university may seem strange, but it is useful for conceiving of the somewhat intangible offerings at stake. By seeing culture as a kind of technology, we can imagine the university as a lab for the innovation of culture. Universities in global cities engage students and faculty in dialogues that support the development of this cultural technology. As faculty members advance their research projects, they are doing so in environments that are increasingly calibrated toward a global awareness, and located in increasingly dynamic global cities. The students who receive instruction from these professors represent a generation with a markedly international ambition, tailoring their areas of study to match. At the bare-bones level, most universities now feature some analogue of the Global Core. Taken together these processes of knowledge production and knowledge acquisition represent an attempt on the part of the university to create the artfully scientific ""perfect localization"" Lee Soo-man describes. Columbia and NYU produce a cultural technology unique to New York. But given that New York belongs to the category of global cities much like London, Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong, its cultural technology shares interfaces with those of other leading cities, rendering it of international relevance and utility. Perhaps this is to say that in the coming decades the only true global universities will be urban ones. It would be wrong to claim that suburban or rural universities can't play this role—they certainly can. We could hardly exclude institutions like Dartmouth or Cornell from these discussions (the latter recently went to great lengths to secure an urban campus in New York). But there is something about an urban environment that better lends itself to the production of cultural technology. Consider again the international student body. In facilitating cross-cultural exchange and common educational experiences for students from a wide range of national backgrounds, urban universities build stronger foundations for transnational networks to emerge, and lower transaction costs in the engagement of those networks. At the simplest level this entails the creation of a cosmopolitan fabric. As students, interacting with international peers gives us a better sense of the mosaic of cultures and affinities we will encounter in our increasingly globalized careers and lives as members of an active citizenry. A nonurban university may be able to offer the same benefits at the level of campus life. However, it is the global city that offers the greatest ability to magnify the importance of these shared experiences vis-a-vis the creation of cultural technology. If your interaction with a Chinese peer gives you an initial, interpersonal awareness of Chinese culture, then the art museums, restaurants, and theaters that a city offers can hone that awareness in a broader contextual sense, while the active presence of multinational companies and international bodies can reaffirm the importance of those cultural inputs as part and parcel of global forces. In this way the university enmeshes with larger projects of cultural technology at play within the city, rendering them more durable and more impactful. If the global city provides the full toolbox for the production of cultural technology, the urban university is perhaps the most critical tool.

60,Global Core,Absurdity in culture,30 January 2013,"S pending the past week packing for my study abroad program in the Netherlands and watching my friends endure the stress of the return to school really felt great. Schadenfreude, I guess. And while everyone has been busy being busy, I have had the luxury of pondering why ggrggg g some choose to go abroad and some g;g§,g.. choose to stay. wggggg The percent of Columbia students . _ I‘ who study abroad is unnecessarily Thlllklllg low. Studying abroad should be the Twice default track, and it should be worked into the Core Curriculum if it claims . ‘ to provide a diverse experience for undergraduates. I would strongly argue that there is no substitute for lived experience. . Most people who choose not to study abroad have a stock excuse that’s some permutation of “it won’t fit into my life.” Some common examples are “I have too many Core classes left” or “I’m quadruple majoring” _ . or “I have a Barclay’s interview in March that I really can’t miss.” I ‘ , These reasons are usually genuine. People want to study abroad but feel unable to. For some students it seems impossible to vanish for a semester. There are two major ironies about this situation: the first is that the Core, which is supposed to broaden our horizons, actually hinders students from the broadening experience of living in another country. This is an easy fix—-eliminate the various unnecessary prerequisites for study abroadand offer it as an alternative to Global Core. V ‘ The second is more difficult. All of these trivial things (clubs, majors, internships, interviews) are . facets of our very specific culture. If we took the time to study other cultures, we could free ourselves from Colurilbia’s oppressive collective anxiety. But we are so wrapped up in the communal delusion that these commitments are all-important that we don’t even have time to look at other cultures. Thus the cycle is - perpetuated. So it turns out that without exposure to other cultures, people drown in their own. Lived experience is the only way out of this loop. I In other words, I ""don’t Want to become cultured, I want to_become cultureless. And it just so happens that the way to become so is by immersing yourself in other ’ cultures until you reach the point where your own seems as absurd as the rest. The content of the culture you immerse yourself in is trivial—you can poke around the world’s wells of wisdom and take a few ideas that you like. But the ultimate benefit is to gain a basis for comparison and, hopefully, perspective. I don’t have a particular vendetta against the highlyproductive, Ivy League-educated, American way of life—l like it a lot, but there are still some things we could learn from the more relaxed corners of the World, just like they can learn from us.When I see my friends obsessing about internships or grades, I find it funny that they can be so invested in a culture without recognizing it as such. They are just as immoderate as the people in Papua New Guinea who munch on the brains of their dead pals. Binging on career fairs and self-medicating with Everclear and Five-Hour Energy is no more normal than the customs and lifestyles around the world that we consider bizarre. . The beauty of studying culture is that it has a geoL metric quality to it. We start off only at a point, just knowing one culture. Learning about how other people live doesn’t only give us another point, but it also cre- ” ates a line of perspective. And a third creates a plane, and so on, so that our understanding increases exponentially when we learn about culture linearly. It’s so hard to break the shell of that first culture, though. ‘ Plato had it right when he said we want to kill whoever informs us of our own delusion: Nobody wants to find outthat they have been living in a world of absurdity, but each culture is just another absurd way to live. i r If we took the time to study other cultures, we could free ourselves from Columbia’s oppressive collective anxiety. a Culture routinely convinces its subjects to do . things that are objectively terrible, like fight in a war A or work eighty-hour weeks as an investment banker or go to law school. What a perfectly evolved way for a society to get what it wants: cultural stigmas and merits convince individuals to suffer for everyone’s sake merely with the promise of status and honor and other things that cost nothing to manufacture but cost your precious time to earn. Your time is worth more to yourself than to anyone else, and without cultural perspective, it is easy to simply become part of someone else’s plan, in which you are sure to be . undervalued. I don’t know what I’ll learn in the Netherlands, but that’s precisely the point. If I knew what I would learn, I wouldn’t have to learn it. I have to take a leap of faith and recognize that there are some things that can only be known through experience. I am trying to heed what the Core has to say: “Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.” The shackles are self-im-posed, and the key to unlock them lies in the knowledge that there are things worth knowing I cannot yet predict; I can only push myself in the direction of stumbling upon them. ‘ Jake Goldwasser is a'Columbia College junior majoring in Middle Eastern studiesand linguistics.

61,Global Core,"USenate talks Global Centers, quality of life",4 February 2013,"BY CECILIA REYES ‘ Spectator Senior Staﬂ Writer The University Senate discussed the results of the Global Initiatives Task Force report as } well as the initial stages of the 1 Student Affairs Committee’s l quality of life survey during ; Friday’s plenary meeting. , . The task force, composed of , both faculty and students‘, focused not only on the Global ‘ Centers, but also on international study options and Global Core requirements. The key issues in the global initiative, according to the task force, are a lack of clear lines of authority, organizational transparency, and effective communication. “Overlapping jurisdic--tions make it difﬁcult to get things done,” senate Executive Committee chair Sharyn O’Halloran said, adding that administrative global functions are often dispersed among different ofﬁces withdifferent constituencies. “We have been thinking aboutthe opportunity of conso_lidating some of these activities.” O’Halloran said that the Global Centers, “if well managed, can play a powerful role in research, educational outreach, and sites to anchor online learning.” - Still, O’Halloran presented a survey indicating that 80 percent of students surveyed were unfamiliar with the Global Centers, as Were 68 percent of facultymembers who were surveyed. . “If you had to put on the board right now one place where faculty and students‘ could get information, could you do that?” physiology professor Samuel Silverstein asked O’Halloran. “Wouldn’t it be useful to centralize diffusion of similar information?” The meeting also reviewed the incipient stages of SAC’s quality of life survey, which was put forth as the ﬁrst of its kind to assess-students’ quality of life beyond local surveys from their respective schools and their associated services. A The project, led by School of International and Public Affairs senator Aly Jiwani, is meant to i become a longitudinal approach to improving students’ quality of life, sent out every two years. . He said that it is not meant to evaluate theperformance of4 individual Columbia services. l A“I am concerned aboutthe long-term implementation of this program,” Daniel Savin, a senior astrophysics researcher, said. “It’s going to extend beyond the tenure of most students here. I would suggest that there be a very clear of- ' ﬁce, administrator, or person at Columbia who has that longterm responsibility to"" ensure there is continuity.” V ~ The surVey’s pilot will be distributed to all student senators to generate an initial response rate of at least 10 people per senator. SAC plans to have the first results by Feb. 22 to begin analysis. The plenary also voted ‘to establish an M.A. in global thought and brieﬂy discussed the Task ‘Force on Smoking Policy’s proposal-to establish designated smoking areas. ’ cecilia.reyes e i V @columbiaspectator.com I"

V I find this practice distracting and annoying—the concept of the West is too broad and ill-defined to . be of productive use in most class discussions. Too many Columbia studentsemploy the term too loosely, ignoring the complexity of many ideas that often clash uncomfortably. An Asian humanities seminar, while discussing the Qu’ran, can easily spend two hours coming up with dichotomies dividing concepts familiar to the Islamic tradition with those of the Western tradition: communities and individuals, charity and self—love, faith and secularism. C A different Asian humanities seminar, while disA cussing the Analects of Confucius, could spend another two hours discussing a different set of binaries: filial piety and the autonomous self, observation of Wtradition and progress toward a telos, communal agricultural economy and free market capitalism. I I use the example of Asian humanities because I '' am most familiar with the courses and because my impressions are fresh. Yet I do not think it an overstatement to say that in our attempts to learn about non-Western cultures and question Western thinking, there is a frequent tendency to hastily toss a simplistic, sweeping, and inadequate characterization of the West onto the discussion table.

Bastardized and unfairly depicted, the Western mentality is often caricatured as some combination of Plato, Smith, and Kant, but rarely in their complex and full, true form.

63,Global Core,The opportunity cost of study abroad,14 February 2013,"My unseemly stack bf lug- _ I gage was ready. My ‘visa and scribbled list of the finest pastries ‘ per arrondissement were in hand. I C was (properly) concerned about the French skills I had garnered after about a year of study and how they = §”¥§§E‘§§?Z§” would fare in philosophy classes at ;‘%‘ﬁ.r§..;‘§.'§;.f§.. - the Sorbonne but I was incredibly thrilled. I 5111311 I never planned on studying , Talk. abroad during college, but at the , ‘ii, ‘ beginning of last semester I applied . straightway. I Wanted out. I knew I was struggling with perspective. I thought the best option was a - change of, scenery and a reminder that there was i more out there. Paris, c’est toujours une bonne ' idée. But it was a difficult decision for personal and academic reasons. So the semester progressed with copious vacillation and the creation oflengthy pro/ con lists ad nauseam. ‘ Each subsequent person gave me a different , opinion and the opposite recommendation. I received word that none of my intended or assured classes would count for my graduation requirements. Finals week trudged by, and I still did I not know whether or not I was going abroad. My friends were appalled and stunned it was still an option. In my defense, endeavoring to procure credits for my majors was time-consuming and bureaucratic but ironically not as challenging as fulfilling . I my Global Core requirement while abroad. (Which genius decided to release petition results for Global Core classes only after the completion of the class?) Then certain factors out of my control put an end to my study abroad plans and I started the semester I here in New York City. Back on our wintry campus, I only wanted to stroll down Boulevard SaintGermain. leven longingly looked at my intended host family’s petite apartment on Google Earth. However, since then I have realized that staying at Columbia was unequivocally thedecision I should have made last year. » ‘ ‘ First, let me establish that this is not an argument against cultural immersion, traveling, or living abroad. It is an account of why our eight semesters at Columbia University should be spent here. The A opportunity cost of studying abroad when we attend a school of the caliber of Columbia University is extraordinary. Why accept those costs when all the benefits of studying abroad can be achieved both now and after graduation? . The financial costs alone are staggering. It costs ’ , about $10.55/hour to be here. If you study abroadyou pay Columbia tuition, but, across the board, university tuition in Europe and other countries around the world is significantly lower. Although , international students often pay higher fees than citizens, the difference is negligible in comparisonto our tuition costs, In six European countries, including the Czech Republic and Italy, tuition is the same for local and foreign students. In Italy, the average fee is $1,928.44/year. You can study in the best universities in Buenos,Aires for as little as $3,700/year. ‘ - ‘ Instead of shopping in Paris, I had to settle for shopping for classes. During those two weeks I , went to a classduring every single time slot of the A day. Simply witnessing the breadth and diversity of knowledge and passion bursting from this_institution was astounding. We should feel privileged every day to be at Columbia, where over 90 percent of the individuals who apply are rejected, not.to mention the billions around the world who never have the opportunity to apply. ' After intending and then failing to go abroad, I realize how much I should appreciate Columbia. I was ‘chasing perspective by running away. A Ask yourself if you are making the most of your time here. The most valuable thing about Columbia is its human capital—the professors ‘and students. I made a concerted effort to get to know more of both this year, and I only wish I had started earlier. Go to your professor’s office hours solely with the agenda of havingia conversation. Sit in on a lecture just once. I found myself considering petitioning for 32 credit hours before realizing with resignation that choices were obligatory and that I only had three semesters left. _ . . Beyond the gates of Columbia lies a metropolis ' that cannot be mastered in four years. New York City is an amalgamation ofmany countries and cultures. Try something new, whether it’s an El Anatsui exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum or casually stalking Bill Cunningham. Turn the corner from 1020 and you’ll encounter a small plaque at 501 ,W. 110th St., where Gershwin wrote “Rhapsody in ~ Blue”. Simply questioning the people you encounteron a daily basis can paintyour worldviewa different color. My last cab driver lost all of his family in the Cambodian Killing Fields, but he was so exuberantly happy to be alive and in America. When’s the last time you asked someone his or her story? All of the legitimate reasons for studying abroad apply after graduation. Live abroad, work abroad, I travel, or study after college. This summer, take a job in a city you’ve never been. How many of the Columbia students who extol studying abroad come back during the summer to live in NYC or in their hometown-s? I am the biggest proponent of per-spective-taking, reflecting on how to give our lives meaning, interdisciplinary study, and learning at every moment. I want to live abroad when I graduate. I want to attain fluency in the languages I speak-. I love traveling. But after intending and then failing to go abroad, I realize how much I should appreciate Columbia. I was chasing perspective by running away, and that is not necessary. . Gaining perspective is a daily struggle, and you donft have to fly across the world to do it or to think outside of the box. Decide to open yourself to understanding others. On a personal level, actively consider why someone thinks and does what they do. Change yourself. No matter where you are, you can learn more about who you are, draw upon a ' wealth of values, and improve. This topic ultimate- ’ ly reduces to a problem with a flawed philosophy about college. College is not the be-all and end-all, but don’t take it for granted. I often manage to fail on both fronts. Imagine the peasants you might encounter while studying abroad in Peru who would "" give anything to be here. Make the most of your time here so you can better the world when you are forced to leave. , We tend to view the world in terms of weeks, months, and finite chunks of time. We work until . the weekend, we think we have to make our best _ friends in college, and we may often hear that “it all goes downhill from here.” But life is a continuous process, and ultimately, no one will care more about the path you chart than yourself. Life doesn’t end when college ends and your situation doesn’t define you. As Buddhist philosopher and leader Daisaku T Ikeda has said, “Your environment does not matter. Everything starts with you I urge each of you to create something, start something, and make a _ success of something. That is the essence of human existence, the challenge of youth.” Sydney Small is a Columbia College junior majoring in ~ economics-philosophy and neuroscience.

64,Global Core,LETTER TO THE EDITOR,19 February 2013,"To the Editor: » V Lanbo Zhang’s article (West versus west, Feb. 7, 2013), which critiqued the way students encountered and discussed the concept, “the West,” was ‘problematic, offensive, and thus begs a response. Throughout his entire article, whether intended or not, Zhang essentially V claims that the Global Core and similar spaces where students are asked to deconstruct “the West” are antiintellectual, uncritical, and unscholarly.”He writes that L in those spaces, “the Western mentality” is “bastardized and unfairly depicted” and that class conversation “devolves into an indictment of Western civilization’s most cherished values.” These points are of great concern to me not just because they’re ridiculous and extreme, but because they reflect a larger institutional problem—a reactionary response from students andfaculty to academic disciplines and scholars that require students to rethink their most cherished beliefs, including—but ' not limited to—“the West” and its relationship to the Third World. . .- _ ‘This dismissive response has resulted historically in the underfunding or dismantling of academic fields of study, the denial of tenure, or even the denial of Ph.D.s for certain scholars. I suggest Zhang read the work of A professor Paul Zeleza for a thorough discussion of how these dismissive responses explain why African stud-. ies is not given its due respect. I would also suggest he read about the experiences of Senegalese scholar Cheikh Anta Diop whoiwas actually denied a Ph.D. from a university for his attempts at encouraging a solid deconstruction of “the West.” Zhang’s response, and others like it, reflect an unwarranted fear and encourage an academic setting in which it is considered wrong to require students to rethink their dearly held beliefs regarding “the West.” ‘ He doesn’t demonstrate even a cursory understanding of the history, function, and content of certain classes considered part of Global Core. Zhang engages in the very same game of caricature he claims he derides. He begins his piece by mentioning the Global Core, then moves on to his experiences from Asian humanities (which is still too general) to make his point-but then indicts Global Core as a whole. This is unfair. It treats his experiences in this narrow subset of classes (withina large field) as exemplary of intellectual practice in the Core more generally. He doesn’t demonstrate ‘even, a cursory understanding of the history, function, and content of certain class‘es considered part of Global Core. His claim that we “desire to compare and contrast the Western with the non-Western” is false and misses the point of classes such as professor Mahmood Mamdani*s Major’Debates L in the Study of Africa. There, the framework of comparison is precisely what is rejected in his class on the grounds that itisets up one society or one way of being as “normal” and another as not. Moreover, the notion that class conversation “devolves into an indictment of cherished” values from the West grossly misrepresents the nature» of class conversations. In the class, I am specifically asked: If there is solid evidence that science, mathematics, monotheism, philosophy, agriculture, and writing, existed in places like Northeast Africa and Southwest Asia long before they were present in regions we now call “the West,” how can they be termed “Western values”? This is a perfectly legitimate question to pose to students in an effort to get them to rethink the concept. A A Kambi Gathesha, GS ’l4"
65,Global Core,The value of the arts,20 February 2013,"BY SAM MICKEL -It’s not just the arts that are important—but art education, too. This is a point argued again and again, and it's one I’m going to state as -fact. I’m a firm believer in the good that arts can bring to a learning environment ' regardless of the goals of a specific education system. I’ve found that those who truly become successful (to the fullest extent of the word) are those who encompass the well-roundedness attributed to that of a Renaissance woman or man. These people appreciate a personal, na- , tional, and global culture that makes life more stimula'ting—not to mention the benefits of an increased sense of creativity, dedication, and collaboration one gains from 1 studying an art. What amazes me, then, is the extent to which our education system is doing away with arts. This largely has to do with the increased pressure for various academic institutions to perform highly on standardized tests under the No Child Left Behind Act or simply that money is tight for most schools in the country. If you_ have to choose between cutting an arts class or a math class, you’re going to cut the former. I am the evaluaC tions coordinator for Artists Reaching Out, a Community Impact program that currently serves as the arts program for P.S. 125 Ralph Bunche’s kindergarten through second grade classes. ‘ It’s worth pointing out that their third to fifth graders currently have no arts program, as those classes were cut specifically so that time could be used for test prep. I acknowledge that it’s very difficult to draw concrete results from an arts program. In most cases ‘there is no clear identifiable outcome. It isn’t like a math class, in which a child can’t do basic arithmetic at the beginning of the year and by the end he/she can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. However, as someone who has taught arts to elementary-age students, that by the end of a year, children were willing and, in most cases, excited to tackle the challenge of drawing the superhero they just made up, write a poem about breakfast, or make up dance steps to a rhythm they’ve come up With themselves. They not only want to create but also take pride in their work and want to share it with us, their teachers, and their fellow. students. . A’ If you have to choose between . cutting an arts class or a math class, you’re going to cut the former. To reiterate a point made by Solomon Hoffman, CC ’l4, many students will never use their knowledge of geometry or calculus past high school or their first years of college, yet we’ve deemed it important to study. I think the same case can be made for art. Yes, most people are not going to go on to become musicians, painters, actors, writers, or dancers. But practicing and studying those things, as with learning that alternate interior angles are congruent, make us more valuable as human beings. -Despite whatever issues exist or don’t exist within the Columbia bureaucracy and arts on the campus (student or « otherwise), the amount of art present on this campus is uncanny. It’s a large reason Why I came to this school. Even. . as institutions trend towards specialization in speciﬁc academic areas—particularly the sciences and engineering——and away from a general liberal arts education, what endures is the Core and Columbia’s dedication to making sure everyone receives some semblanceof a well-round-ed education that includes the arts. Even SEAS students who are given the option to take Lit Hum, Contemporary Civilizations, or peruse the Global Core, still have to take either Music or Art Hum. Beyond simply the required art ‘classes that we are all required to take, I’d say that, to make a very (very) rough estimate, something like 75 percent of the'Columbia community is in some way, shape, or form is involved in the arts scene on campus. Whether that means being a member of a dance, theater, visual art, music, or creative writing group on campus, going to see or participate in an event on campus hosted by one of those groups, taking advantage of the TIC, or going to a museum for free, we manage to get a whole bunch of people involved. I hope it forever stays that way, appreciating and making the arts accessible and ideally using its inﬂuence to help increase the presence of arts in school from pre-school on up to higher education. .

66,Global Core,THE CHINA GAME,21 February 2013,"I I PLAYING POLITICS WITH INTERNATIONAL STUDENTSBY WILFRED CHANAndy’ never expected to see a Chinese food cart next to the gates of Columbia University. ' » “I was surprised when I saw it, ” he says of the newly opened cart, which frequently draws long lines of Chinese students. “I ‘ thought, this place is getting less and less American.” ' Andy is from China. He is tall, lanky, and sports metal glasses beneath his swept haircut. Despite language difficulties, he came from Guangdong province at the age of 18, hoping to immerse himselfin American culture and make white friends (With, he says, “blue eyes, yellow hair, and a hairy face”). But now a senior in Columbia College, he has come to accept a different social reality. b “Here, there are a lot of events I’ve never thought about taking part in,” he says. “Bacchanal? Nope. Orgo Night? » Never been there. The Varsity Show? HaVen’t seen it. In the first place, you feel like the environment is not very friendly _ to you so you voluntarily limit yourself. But also, I’m just not that interested.” T This is not just about a misfit. This is the story of a rarely discussed but complicated group of students whose lives are ’Editor’s Note: Name changed. ’: increasingly intertwined with bigger questions of global politics a ' and race—Chinese international students. This is the story of how they’re changing Columbia. The Hottest Game in Town 2 V V Five years ago, there were 929 Chinese international students T. f enrolled at Columbia, comprising about one—seventh of the'Univer—sity’s international population. But by fall 2012, the Chinese international student population has exploded to 2,254 students, making up almost one—third of all Columbia international students. Because the University does not release breakdowns for all schools, it is unclear how many of these students are undergraduates—though the general consensus is a lot. . What is clearer is that the increased Chinese student presence , is one result of a deliberate and determined effort by Colu.mbia’s leadership to go “global.” During a 2008 fireside chat, University President Lee Bolljnger said that Columbia strives to obtain the “best minds of the world, ” regardless of geographic location or nationale ity. In 2012, Barnard President Debora Spar told the New York ""limesin no uncertain terms, “we’re growing [the international student population] dramatically.” In the rhetoric of today’s American higher education professionals, going “global” is almost always - a good thing. What they don’t say is that it usually means going to China. , I According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, foreign student growth in the United States is largely due to “double—digit growth from China, primarily at the undergraduate level.” Student growth from other countries, such as India, South Korea, and Canada, has ﬂatlined in recent years, owing in part to the . economic downturn, ' A That’s why China, with its continued economic growth, is the hottest game in town. One need only look at the University of Delaware, which drove Chinese international enrollment from just eight students in 2007 to 517 students in 2012; or Barnard, which has seen a 540 percent increase in applications from China over the last seven years; or the other Ivy League schools, which all maintain deeply funded, aggressively competitive Chinese outreach efforts, to see that the race is on. “It’s about keeping up with the Joneses, ” ex—plains one former Columbia administrator. “You have one of the most crazy—interested—in—education ’ markets in the world, and a very large number of the population is now capable of funding their kids to go to the U.S. Let’s say you let Northwestern, UChicago, and Georgetown sort of run you over in the China market. That would really damage your international brand, which is something that schools need to take into consideration.” , “Sadly we still live in the world where the more students that apply, the more prestigious your school is. So to stay relevant in this market, you have to up ‘ your China game.” i _ But while today’s mad scramble for Chinese students appears to represent a broad consensus in higher education strategy, there was not always as , much agreement. Columbia Provost John Coatsworth told Spectator last semester that the move to a more global univer—sity followed intense debate among adrnin—istrators and faculty during the 19905. .“It was a really serious issue, the question of whether we would berecruiting abroad for talented students,” said Coatsworth. “Would it change the character of the University? Would it change the mission of the University?” Welcome to America Each fall, the new waves of Chinese international students who ﬂood into Morningside Heights face a simple challenge: fitting in. This is harder than it looks. GOING ‘GLOBAL’ IS G THING WHAT THEY DON’T I Andy says that he initially planned to explore new social groups when he arrived. “Even though I wasn’t sure if I would be corrlfortable hanging out with white V people all the time, I was prepared for it,” he said. But, he explains, he didn’t feel like other students were interested in him, or saw beyond his appearance. Most of his close friends now are Chinese.“I’m not disappointed—l got used to it, ” he says matter—of— factly. “Still, would you want to go to China to meet American people?” Chris’ Cheung graduated from Columbia last year and remembers ﬁnding it difficult to branch out. For him, it was because of the close friendships he formed in the Hong Kong Students and Scholars Society, of which he was president. “Once I found this group of good friends,” he says, “I became comfortable settling down and was less proactive to take advantage of the rich diversity the student community had to offer.” _ ; Yet Chris considers himself “very lucky.” Observing that ' most international Students Suffer a sense of “disorientation anddisplacement,” he says he is thankful to have found a . base “rather quickly. ” But these friendship circles are sometimes viewed by bewildered observers as counter— productive forms of “self— segregation. ” A One of my friends, a female, Indian international student at Columbia College, says the Chinese international community seems to form an “insular culture and nationality—based community for themselves, ” which she describes as “frustrating,” “alien—ating, ” and “completely baffling.” “Why come to an American university, why travel thousands of miles, , why seek out this unique educational experience if you’re going to close yourself off from the majority of your peers and just recreate what you could’ve had back home?” she asked. A » Indeed, some Chinese international students avoid Columbia’s Chinese community altogether. Barnard senior Natalie Lau grew up attending the American International School in Hong Kong, and decided to steer clear of Chinese culture clubs at Columbia. “I think I went to a few of their events and I was like, cool, this is so not my scene,” she says. “I’m looking for a place where I can have the freedom to be a part of my culture without necessarily having to be completely submerged in it.” ’ . As Spar advised Asian international students in a recent New York Times article, “Don’t just hang out with people from your country—l think that’s a real risk.” But “hanging out” is sometimes just the beginning of students’ problems. Strict immigration laws—kept stubbornly in place by Congress——often prevent even the most well—ad—- ' justed foreign students from becoming full members of Americansociety. Lau identifies as “culturally American,” but says it is “pretty much impossible” for her to remain in America after graduation and pursue her dream of teaching or nonprofit work. ' As a student on an F—l visa, she is only allowed to work in the United States for one year following graduation under a program called Optional Practi— v cal Training, before she is required to find a company that is willing to shell out tens of thousands of dollars to pay for a permanent work visa. However, only corporate and ﬁnance jobs come with the resources to sponsor these students, and this severely limits the options of international students with other dreams.“I’m terrified of the prospect of going home, \ « because I never really fit into Hong Kong culture. Growing up, I never had the freedom to explore what was out there. But I’ve had a taste of freedom. And - now, having, in a way, been ruined, I can’t go back,” she says with a rueful laugh. 3 ’ Other Chinese international students struggle to fully fund their educations. As Bollingerwas quoted as saying in an April 2012 Spectator article, Columbia does “not have sufficient financial aid for international students.” But whether or not Columbia can fund international students, it does profit‘ from them. As the Spectator article points out, while the international student population grew by 60.1 percent from 2004 to 2011, the University’s income from those students rose by 121.3 percent in the same ‘amount of time. I - In this case, there is evidence that money matters are tied into bigger, more complex racial and geopolitical tensions simmering beneath the ‘ surface. In the same article from last April, the ’ comments section spiraled into a 57:post th-read debating the merits of Chinese international stu~ dents, with the top—rated comment declaring their increased numbers to be “some sort of sick joke, ” accusing “anti—American admissions policies” of arming Chinese students to become “dangerous competitors” to American power. A comment below says, “Agreed. These Chinese and Asians maybe [sic] smart in math and engineering, but generally cannot speak, read or write English at anywhere near an ivy league [sic] level. Let alone if they know anything about Western philosophy, literature, culture, amd [sic] art. Why are they being admitted?” And, eight months later, an op—ed by Connor Hailey, a Columbia College sophomore, accused Columbia of admitting “wealthy internationals in the name of diversity, only to turn away an American who could have been the next great statesman.” Sometimes, though, the motives behind prejudice are less clear. . One of my white friends, a Columbia student, I confesses to me privately, “I know it’s wrong, but ""sometimes I still want to laugh when I hear someone with an Asian accent speaking in class.

67,Global Core,"Awn hopes to expand Lit Hum, CC for GS",1 March 2013,"- BY JORDAN F REISLEBEN Spectator Staﬁ” Writer Adam Gentle, GS ’l5, had what he calls a “rigid, preconceived vision of the world” when he arrived at Columbia last year, but he now credits his Contemporary Civilization course with helping him re-evaluate the world around him. Though Gentle is currently enrolled in one of the two CC sections exclusively for School. of General Studies students, GS stu- ' dents are not required to take CC or Literature Humanities as part of their Core Curriculum. But GS Dean Peter Awn said he wants to change this. “This idea ﬁrst started a couple of years ago, but the implementation has been a little, slow,” Awn said. “The key is that there are not enough sections for all of the students in GS, so you can’t make it a requirement.” Currently, GS students can take Lit Hum or CC to fulﬁll their literature or social science general education requirements, respectively, but only a handful of students can ﬁt in the two CC sections. A third GS-only Lit Hum section was added this year. Awn said that adding Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization as GS requirements would be the “ﬁnal step” in synchronizing the Columbia College and GS curricula, a process that began in the mid-1980s. A Global Core requirement was added for GS students last year. “ '’ ' i “There is progress—not as rapid T as people would like it to be, but there’s progress,” Awn said. The primary roadblock to the addition of the Lit Hum and CC requirements is funding. “It’s an exceedingly expensive program to run, as we know through the college,” Awn said. “It’s not designed for efﬁciency, but for intense collaboration between the students and faculty.” Though Awn does not have a timeline for the changes he wants to make, he said GS is slowly increasing the number of GS—only Lit Hum and CC sections until it is feasible to require all students to take one of the classes. For Gentle, Lit Hum and CC were integral parts of his Columbia experience. “I think what makes a Columbia education a Columbia education is the Core,” Gentle said. “Given the opportunity, I would love to take the same Core requirements as the college, and I think it’s good for the GS degree to have the same backing as the college.” Ann Gleason, GS ’l4, is cur- ' rently enrolled in a GS-only Lit Hum section. She said she agreed that the Core is a deﬁning aspect of Columbia. “CC and Lit Hum are the back— g bone of the undergraduate program at Columbia University,” she said. “CC and Lit Hum remind one that Columbia is not just a trade school with the lovely veneer of classical architecture.” Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Dalia Inbal, an instructor of one of the GS—only Lit Hum sections, said that the two courses are important precursors to other classes at Columbia. . “From my students, I’ve heard that since CC and Lit Hum are such important parts of the Columbia curriculum, texts read in these classes automatically come up in other classes,” Inbal said. Inbal added that the breadth of GS students’ backgrounds onlyadds to the classroom dynamic. “Discussions are particularly rewarding and challenging given the very different backgrounds and life experiences GS students have,” she said. Sandipto Dasgupta, GSAS, teaches one of the two GS-only CC sections. Last year, he taught CC at the college. “To be honest, I wish I had a course like CC in my undergraduate experience,” Dasgupta said. Like Inbal, Dasgupta appreciates the diverse backgrounds of the students in his GS section. “As a teacher, it’s always a joy to teach with that because you have a lot more to work with,” he said. “When you have people with muchmore life experience, it creates a richer class.” ~ Awn said that ﬁnancial issues aside, the proposal to require Lit Hum and CC for GS students faces no opposition. “There’s no intellectual or administrative resistance, except we’re all realists about what can be done and what can’t be done with budgets,” he said. The next step, Awn said, is to fund a Core endowment, which he said “would help free up the tension for funds that could be used to add additional sections of CC and Lit Hum.” While Gentle is a proponent of making both courses requirements, he acknowledged the difﬁculties it could pose for some GS transfer students.“There’s a huge time pressure,” he said, adding that there “would? have to be some ﬂexibility” forl transfers hoping to graduate inf two years. » ‘ ’ Gentle said he wants to gradu-j ate knowing that he received the signature Columbia education. “VVe don’t want to be ‘lesss than,’ and I think a way not to be: ‘less than’ is to remove the per—Z ception that GS is an academically: less rigorous environment with: _ fewer requirements,” Gentle saidgj “Sometimes there’s abit of an insecurity—l like to feel like we’re re-: ceiving the exact same education”: “If the Core’s the same, then: we’re doing the same thing,” he f added. j jordan.ﬁ‘eisleben;_ @columbiaspectator.com"
68,Global Core,Cursory conditioning,3 April 2013,"My ﬁrst Lit Hum class ‘ ' began with a discus- . . , sion of literature. Why is it ; important? Why do we study ‘ i the humanities? How can we ,_f 3 >- i represent the human condi--1 tion, and can we learn more rggfg about it through art? RAg;a§'g{gV~§g_3§§_ Frontiers of Science ‘ . started with a look at the , scientiﬁc method, a few basic but vital lessons relating the uses and shortcomings of statistics, and a heavy emphasis on the logical and analytic crafting of estimations. In The Rise of Civilization, my ﬁrst Global Core class, we examined biases and assumptions that I had not even realized I held. We spent weeks trying to deﬁne “civilization” to no avail. But that was the whole point. The path we have taken. through history splintered. It became A irreversibly nebulous and subject to academic guesswork and philosophizing. Biting questions regarding that path in the future were raised. When I took karate, we stretched, ran laps, did push-ups, and received our uniforms. What I am aiming to point out in these comparisons is the rather deﬁning divide between most Core Curriculum classes—-whether a speciﬁc course or a fulﬁllment of a distribution requirement—and the physical education classes, which are also included in the Core. You might say that this parallelism does not highlight what I mean it to. The ﬁrst three are academic but the fourth is physical. Why should it have to be cerebral, too? Would that not be missing the I point of physical activity’s presence in our curriculum? Sound mind, sound body. We need a healthy, growing body to balance our likewise changing minds. Now, I’rn no opponent of exercise. I understand and appreciate the positive impact physical activity has beyond just calorie burning. I’ve read the articles and I took health in high I school. I go to the gym to run, relax, get happy, and empty my head. The power of movementof harnessing the body and using it as more than a vehicle for our brains—is one of liberation. To me, though, the argument behind Columbia physical education classes that it prioritizes a space for meditation in our lives simply does not match the reality. ' This institution—both Columbia and the institution of college on a broader scale——is a cerebral one. We self-identify as students here, before anything else. Studying, learning, and ultimately geffiiig an academic degree are our means and ends. We ﬁnd Columbia appealing for its capacity to strengthen both our minds and the opportunitiesthat the worldwide recognition of that capacity affords us. Yes, there is a great deal else to do here. It is certainly a necessary and formative part of the learning experience to involve ourselves in a variety of cultural, athletic, creative, and social pursuits that are challenging. Through these extracurriculars, we pick up skills and interests and forge relationships that might fundamentally change us. At the end of the day, though, we “ return to our roles of intellectual apprenticeship and settle back comfortably with labels like pre-med or poli—sci/econ that dictate our ’ primary paths. That does not mean that I think physical education unimportant. In fact, I consider physical education to be an essential element of the Core’s philosophy. Only, here, I think we must recognize thevdistinction betweenphysical I education and physical activity. I took karate for a semester and greatly enjoyed it. The difference lays in why I enjoyed it. It required little effortno deep or critical exertion. I found it fun, but it did not challenge me. And so I asked myself: Why do I have to take a class like this? Ivbelieve the weakness of our physical education classes is due to the fact that we privilege intellectuality, which both the school and its student body indulge in. We also do not understand how physical education should really act in the Core. I am not interested in being forced to lightly participate in some cardio exercise twice a week for ﬁfty minutes. If Columbia took physical education more seriously, it might consider offering a course concerned with why the body, exercise, sports, and soon are so.important. Some sort of Body Hum would prove inﬁnitely more useful in imparting an awareness to the beneﬁts of physical activity than mandated exercise that many of us do not take very seriously. i » l This would mean, of course, more reform in the availability and transparency of Columbia’s athletic faculties. It is not hard to learn—inj -deed, Columbia’s bureaucracy encourages the study of—our university’s intricate rules regarding academics. For a variety of reasons, though, I ﬁnd it inﬁnitely more difﬁcult to navigate the athletic facilities. Less care is given to advertising this side of our education to the majority of us, and so we do not take advantage of the things we have (or should have) at our disposal. Columbia’s physical education, as an extension of the Core, fails. It assumes we follow the logic of sound mind, sound body. But even worse, it does not critically examine that tenet as it asks us to do of everything else. The inclusion of physical activity feels like it is tacked on. This is a shame. There is space for so much to be done for such an interesting and central topic of life. ~ Ben Rashkovich is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in creative writing.

A ’ "" ’ I went to Lehman Library to check E 4 1%. N 3 Q out a book earlier this week. The ZIIAN S building’s facade is unsightly and the interior is dilapidated. N o preservation SeC 0 n d society will ﬁght to preserve the ar- I mp 1- e S chitecture for its aesthetic worth. The - wrecking ball can’t hit soon enough, SlO n S and I’m glad that President Spar has the good sense to plan ahead. Barnard’s ﬁnances have been in shambles for as long as any current student cares to remember. It is telling that in the same meeting in which Spar announced her intention to replace Lehman, she simultaneously voiced doubt about Barnard’s ability to pay the $l5O million bill for demolition and reconstruction. _ More importantly, as the 21st century moves along, I wonder whether Barnard can continue to justify its existence as an independent undergraduate school alongside Columbia College. Meaningless rhetoric and labels aside, I wonder whether in 20 or 30 years Barnard will be able to offer its students a college experience that is substantially or even noticeably different from one at Columbia College. I wonder whether it does right now. I don’t want to compare mission statements or dwell on the merger between Barnard and Columbia that almost took place 30 or so years ago. We are told that Barnard is a small liberal arts college in New York and that Columbiaifis the big research university under whose ’ umbrella Barnard resides. Yet beside the label and the ~ rhetoric, I doii‘t see how the substance of a Barnard education necessarily differs from a Columbia College one. While different degree and major requirements exist, the classes that fulﬁll those requirements are often the same ones—with the obvious exception of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Degree and major requirements are, by design, ﬂexible and lenient enough to accommodate a wide variety of academic experiences. While Columbia’s academic program does not directly correspond with Barnard’s—that is to say there isn’t a Columbia equivalent for every Barnard requirement and vice versa—the differences seem to me more administrative and arbitrary than substantive. I understand that there are minute differences between the Columbia College science requirement and the Barnard Laboratory Science requirement, and that the Global Core is slightly different from Cultures in Comparison. Yet, it is entirely possible that two students, one registered at Columbia, another registered at Barnard, can graduate with similar degrees, having taken many of the same courses. Having never used the advising, health, career, or any other support services at Barnard—and to be honest,having barely used the ones at Columbia either—l can’t speak to whether tangible differences exist between the two. However, I don’t think there are necessary and essential differences between the host of administrative and support services available on both sides of the street. Perhaps differences exist now, but there is no reason they have to. What differences there may be do not deﬁne Barnard or Columbia—they are incidental. If Columbia split its undergraduate support services in half, the ﬁrst half catering to students whose names begin A—L, the second half catering to students whose names begin M-Z, there might be some differences in the quality of one half compared to the other half. However, that is not to say that the two halves will differ in kind. Barnard’s advising system might be in much better shape than Columbia’s, but that difference hardly merits a separate school. While a Barnard— Columbia merger might seem logical, it is more likely to be caused by economic reasons than one of educational philosophy. : I can’t for the life of me ﬁgure out how the social ; life could be so different on the other side of the street.’ . Living in womens-only dormitories could be seen as ; signiﬁcant, but given that Barnard students have the op- ' portunity to live off-campus or in Columbia residence ‘ halls, it is hardly an unshakeable pillar of the Barnard I experience. The fact is that Columbia and Barnard share classrooms, we eat at the same restaurants, go out to the . same bars, and ride the same subway trains. _ l' While a Barnard-Columbia rnerger might seemhlogical, it is more likely to be caused by economic reasons than one of educational philosophy. Barnard is in a rather dire situation—pools are being closed, doubles are being turned into triples, and physical education requirements are being curtailed. Columbia, despite the Manhattanville expansion, will continue to View limited space as its biggest impediment toward further expansion. Especially if they become more acute, Barnard’s dire ﬁnances and Columbia’s demand for space would make a merger mutually beneﬁcial. If and when a merger occurs, I don’t know whether we—that is, Columbia AND Barnard—will lose much aside from the administrative overlap that currently exists. And where does that overlap come from? It comes as a result of the separate history of the two schools, because at one point in time, Columbia didn’t see it ﬁt to accept women. A I So, why isn’t a merger being seriously considered?

71,Global Core,Grant will fund more courses abroad,1 May 2013,"BY SAMANTHA COONEY ‘’ AND'CECILIAiI€EYE'S' I ’ i Spectator‘Senior Staff Writers In 2014, undergraduates who study abroad will have even more courses to choose from as Columbia continues to embrace a global mind-set. With the support of a $2.1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, administrators and faculty are embarking on a project to design and approve courses that will be offered exclusively abroad. = Nine departments have submitted 10 proposals for courses. Interim Executive Vice President ' for Arts and Sciences David Madigan, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Carlos Alonso, and Columbia College Dean James Valentini will review them with regard to instruction and budgetary possibilities. The Committee on Instruction will then have to apI prove them. » _ “Some of them are the same types that are currently taught in New York that will be modiﬁed somewhat to be taught in a location abroad,” Jack Snyder, chair of the subcommittee of global education in the Educational Policy and Planning Committee, said. “Some of them are brand , new courses that are designed speciﬁcally around the location abroad where they will be taught, dealing with the culture or his- ' tory of that area.” Faculty are still discussing the possibility of using the grant 'to offer Music. Humanities, Art Humanities, and Global Core classes. abroad, a change l-that University President Lee ' ' Bollinger has expressed a strong interest in seeing. Some courses will only be offered during the summer. In the fall of 2012, the EPPC appointed Snyder, a profes- ' sor of international relations at the School of Internationaland Public Affairs, to chair the subcommittee. He ledia survey of academic departments to evaluate how well global programs were serving their students. “We also surveyed undergraduate students, too, just_ to ﬁnd out what their plans were, what their concerns were, what their hopes were for opportunities,” he said. The survey results showed that undergraduatesmost Want to learn about a particular region’s culture, expand their O knowledge of foreign languages, and participate in summer internships or programs abroad with more ﬂexible schedules. When the committee learned that Columbia had been awarded the Mellon grant, Snyder said that “there was a question of how to turn the general language of the grant into a speciﬁc plan.” The project is estimated to last for the next six and a half years, and the Mellon Foundation has pledged another $2 million in ""support of the project after the ﬁrst three and a half years. i Four additional faculty members across all relevant departments will be appointed over the ﬁrst year. Snyder said new hireswould most likely replace senior faculty who choose to teach abroad, noting that the proposals “are designed to let current faculty members go abroad.” The locations of the new courses will not necessarily be tied to any one of the eight Global Centers, although some proposals make use of locations where Columbia already offers study abroad programs, such as Reid Hall in Paris, Snyder said. Dean of General Studies Peter Awn said he was excited to be able to offer courses that engage in a “robust, multicultural environment” to his students, though he added that there should be i careful consideration about the placement of these courses in countries that have censorship =codes. . “There is no use in meeting in an environment without intellectual freedom,” Awn said, “though it all depends on the courses.” is The global education subcommittee still has yet to hammer out logistics, including ﬁnancial aid and language prerequisites. “We’Ve made it clear that this, for us, is a big priority to make summer experiences abroad available, at least to Columbia College undergraduates,available regardless of their l personal ﬁnancial situations,” Snyder said. ‘ “One of my goals, which I have stated many times, is to be able to offer every student in the College one funded summerexperience, whether it be an internship, fellowship or study ' abroad opportunity,” Valentini ' said in an email. For most study abroad programs, ‘students are required to have completed two years"" of college language courses or the equivalent to participate. But Snyder noted that this may not be a practical requirement, given the nature of some of the new courses. A Snyder said that the, goal of the subcommittee and faculty members spearheading this project is to provide students with opportunities that interest them most, from courses abroad to undergraduate research opportunities with faculty. “I think that we should offer global education opportunities that respect the diversity of student needs and interests,” Snyder added. “We want to have a menu that has lots of really good options for students and to allow students to pick the kind ~ of experience that will be good for them.” news@columbiaspectatorzcomAROUND THE WORLD | Jack Snyder says the grant will fund new, exclusive study abroad classes."
72,Global Core,Chained to campus,13 September 2013,"g BY KIMBERLY MILAM Last year, whenever I would bite into a Dough donut in Brooklyn, sip on some Eataly hot chocolate in the Flatiron District, or devour an arepa at Caracas Arepa Bar in the East Village, I knew that there was a hidden cost to my enjoyment: my meal plan. With either 15 or 19 meals per Week already paid for, most Columbia ﬁrst-years are paying for both their consumed meal and their forsaken meal at‘ the dining hall when eating out. The excessive cost of eating out due to the meal plan adds exclusivity to New York City and restricts ﬁrst-years from truly exploring the city, First-years are essentially punished for eating out and experiencing the city that attracted many of them to Columbia in the ﬁrst place. '— - Columbia’s application requests a listing of concerts, shows, and cultural events the applicant attended in the past year. By doing so, the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions is looking for candidates who will leave the Columbia “bubble” between 120th and 110th streets, who will partake in the cultural experiences that the city offers, which should supplement the education received on campus. As Columbians, we are expected to make the most out of our location, utilizing New York city as our off-campus classroom; We are taught not only how to be students, but also how to be cultured and worldly. However, this is an unrealistic expectation for firstyears, who are required to buy a large meal plan. Themeal plan is not conducive to promoting education through life experience. In order to escape paying for two meals——the meal eaten out and the forsaken prepaid meal—we must be back for the 8 p.m. closing time of John Jay and Ferris, and we must limit dgijirfexplorations, especially of restaurants. . The meal plan is a restriction limit--Ing free movement around the city, chaining ﬁrst-years to campus for meals. Food is a medium for exploration and experience. Almost weekly, I‘ went to Brooklyn for Smorgasburg, an artisan food market. I came for the food, I stayed and returned for the experience. Smorgasburg drew me to Bedford, and I fell in love with the area, wandering throughthe vintage clothing stores and boutiques. This wasn’t a rare occurrence for me: I’ve traversed the city in search oflrestaurants and have loved experiencing many of the city’s neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many of my peers cannot say the same, because they rarely leave the conﬁnes of Morningside Heights. The meal plan is a restriction limiting free movement around the city, chaining ﬁrst-years to campus for meals. Much of New York City culture is embedded within itsfood. You are not a true New Yorker until your ﬁrst Shake Shack burger, Momofuku cookie, or Magnolia cupcake. These are iconic culinary staples of New York City for tourists and locals alike. To truly experience the city, such fares must be sampled. ' Q"" g A past and present city of immigrants, Manhattan offers the cultural experience that classes, especially those in the Global Core, aim to offer. Restaurants that offer ethnic food can be an active classroom, conveying the true essence of a culture—food. In New York, we are offered easy access to foreign cultures. Taste the Korean barbecue in Koreatown. Consume the fresh pasta in Little Italy. Sample the noodles and dumplings in Chinatown. Though geographically different from their origins, these Manhattan neighborhoods offer authentic food and culture. Other neighborhoods offer present historic American immigrant culture. On the Lower East Side, I visited the neighborhood where my Jewish Russian grandfather grew up to experience history and culture through gastronomy. I ate the knishes and kugel typical of his upbringing, and through them, I truly got a glimpse into his life. I. Removing ﬁrst—year meal plan restrictions can only help Columbia. By instating a large, mandatory meal plan, Columbia is limiting our education, which should go be» yond the classroom. Allocate the meal plan by semester rather than by week. Reduce the meal requirement. Make it not be required. Just, please, loosen the chains that tie ﬁrst-years to campus and Morningside Heights.

73,Global Core,A storied history: La Maison Française at 100,17 September 2013,", BY SARAH ROTH Spectator Senior Staﬁ’ Writer This semester, the campus is saying “joyeux , anniversaire” to La Maison Francaise. \ ~ 2013 is the 100th anniversary of the founding _ of Columbia’s cultural institution devoted to the study of French culture—the ﬁrst of its kind on an - American campus—and it’s being celebrated with \‘s‘Century 1913-2013,” an ongoing exhibit of international, institutional, and military signiﬁcance held ' ~ in the lobby of Buell Hall. La Maison Francaise’s P story began in 1913 on the eve of World War 1, under University President Nicholas Murray Butler, who “felt it was important to offer an international _, perspective to students at Columbia,” Shanny Peer, j ""the director of La Maison, said. I ‘ A “Global education is an important emphasis «V pf the University today, and what is interesting ' is that there was a similar kind of move around the time of when the Maison Frangaise was created,” she said. ‘a In particular, Butler had close ties to France, both academic and personal, as the president of the France—America Society, which was originally headquartered at La. Maison Francaise. The exhibit features calling cards from some of Butler’s French correspondences—including viticulturist 3‘ Maréchal Joffre and historian Gustave Lanson—as well as a number of medals given to Butler in recognition of his attendance at the 1900 Exposition i Universelle in Paris. These pieces highlight the intimacy of Butler’s relationship with France. Research for the exhibition, which opened Sept..s, began more than a yearago. in “It’s really a process of looking at a lot of material and distilling it and ﬁguring out where the stories are and how to shape it,” Peer said. “We wanted to tell the story of the Maison Frangaise, but we also Wanted to inscribe that story within a few larger narratives.” . . The exhibit also touches upon the important role that La Maison Francaise played in the two world wars. On display are photographs from October 1918 showing the Columbia Student Army Training Corps doing drills behind Low Library, as well as images of a professor in his military uniform writing the lyrics to the French national anthem—a stark reminder that not even Columbia students were safe from the tides of war. “We wanted to tell the story of the Maison Frangaise but we also wanted to inscribe that story within a few larger narratives. ” s ~Shanny Peer, _ director of La Maison Frangaise V Alongside these photos sits a 1942 letter from the Committee for French Scholars asking for do-li-ations to help French professors and students who were sent into exile after the Nazi invasion. One line from the letter stands out: “Are you interested and will you help?” The answer to both was “Yes.” ’ “Nicholas Murray Butler was very instrumental ‘in getting the United States involved in the war,” Peer said. . Butler and other members of the France- . America Society, including treasurer J .P. Morgan, “lfobbied behind the scenes to build up American public support to go into the war,” she said. 3 ln conjunction with the exhibit, La Maison Francaise will also be offering a series of special _events throughout the coming months, including _ documentary screenings, theater performances, roundtable discussions, and lectures. The ﬁrst lecture in the fall series, titled “Thought Police: The J FBI and French Philosophers,” will feature a talk Andy Martin, of the University of Cambridge, on Wednesday. The lecture series is carrying forward the tra- ‘ dition of prominent French intellectuals speaking at the University. In 1945-6, French philosopliers J ean—Paul Sartre and Albert Camus spoke at Columbia on their ﬁrst trip to the United States. Throughout their visit, the two men were followed by the FBI, and the content of the FBI ﬁle forms the basis forthis lecture. - A A A_ “They were suspected of being political sub~versives and their ties with the left and ﬂirtation -with the Communist Party made them suspects in the eyes of J. Edgar Hoover,” Peer said. While the, physical exhibit is rooted in the history of La Maison Frangaise, the institution is ‘still very much a presence on campus today, and its original purpose of promoting international relations can be glimpsed in everything from Columbia College’s Global Core requirementto the political science major. , . , In the ﬁnal section of the exhibit, titled “The Columbia Maison Frangaise Today,” two pictures ‘sit side by side. One is dated 1961, and shows a crowd of people making their way into a lecture given at La Maison Frang:aise’s original 117th Street 1 building. The adjacent photo depicts a scene of students huddling around a table to sign up for a lecture given by philosopher J cques Ranciere last September. The two images icely echo each other, a testament to the building’s history. 1 “Century 1913-2013” runs through Oct. 30. sarah.roth@columbiaspectgtoncom"
74,Global Core,WILLIAM THEODORE DE BARY,26 September 2013,"Professor William Theodore de Bary, the John Mitchell Mason professor of Asian humanities and provost emeritus of the University has been a presence at CO- - his freshman year in the College in 1937. After serving in World War 11, he came back to Columbia to earn his master’s degree and Ph.D. in 1953. His lifelong dedication to conversations between Eastern and Western civilizations and his active advocacy of a Lit Hum—style East Asian core have won him enormous respect in the Columbia community and worldwide. CAMILLE PETERSON sat down with professor de Bary for a chance to hear some Columbia wisdom.What first interested you in East Asian studies and in developing Co|umbia’s East Asian studies program? It started with the first class I had in Hamilton Hall, which was Contemporary Civilization taught by Harry Carman. At that first class, when I was sit—ting in the front row, he said, “Of course you know that CC is just civilization in the West. What We need is some young people to prepare themselves to include Asia in the process.” Well, I didn’t have any good idea What I Wanted to do. That seemed like an appealing idea to me, so I started learning Chinese. You’ve been an advocate for bringing nonWestern thought into the Core for a while. What do you think makes the expansion of the Core imperative for a college education? We’re living in one world. And if we want to understand our World the Way We think We can understand the West through CC and the humanities, we have to extend that same process.In my book, The Great Civilized Conversation, I consider the key Word to be “conVersation. ” This appears Very early in the Writings of former Columbia professors John Erskine and Mark Van _ Doren. What they were doing was picking up on the conversation with the great minds of the past. That is the best Way for you to come to terms With your past—everybody has to do that. There isn’t any ﬁxed quantity or canon that can sum up your past, but you can get the best access to it by reading what the great minds said about the issues that were foremost in their minds. Do you think there are significant conflicts between Eastern and Western philosophical tradition? There are differences, but I don’t think they’re fundamental. You?l1 ﬁnd both that there is a great deal held in common as Well as that there is a great deal of difference. These things go together~ common Values and different contexts. You haveto deal with both. You have to recognize that the combination is irreducible in all human experience. What do you think is the one essential thing that we need to learn from East Asian texts? ‘ ' I don’t think there is any one thing. You need to learn to read the texts. The process is very irnpor—tant. You read the texts and size them up for yourself. Then you get together With your peers and discuss to see what they think. Have they drawn the same conclusions? Have the classics spoken to them in the same way? Then, you have that check. Your first reaction is subjective, but once you articulate it, it becomes objective. It’s out in the open. Then it can become the basis for conversation. In your book, Nobility and Civility, you mention that Confucius focuses on the “true nature of leadership.” What do you think world leaders today could learn from Confucius’ teachings? The key concept is trust. There has to be some common element that provides the basis for dealing with other people. They know that they can trust your word, that you will act according to your word, and that you can come together to deal with shared problems because you can, to some extent, count on somebody else to be a true human being. The irnpor—tance of trust is true for all people, but it’s especially important for the leader. You can recognize that , when you look at our present Congress. To the extent that we have any hope of resolving the current problems in Congress, it depends on certain people in Congress being recognized as promoting genuine conversation and compromise. Do you have any words of wisdom for current Columbia students regarding thetCore? The most important thing I could say to them given the conditions that exist now with respect to the Core requirements—they are not focused on a A ' “core. ” You have a Global Core and What is, in effect, a distribution requirement that goes off in any direction you want. It doesn’t bring people together on “core” issues. The only way I could suggest they do it is to take the courses We designed for the CoreAsian humanities and Asian civilization—and not the alternatives that have been proposed. If they take those classes, then they would make a start on a genuine world conversation. If they don’t do that, then forget it. Their education is aborted after they take Lit Hum and CC. They don’t progress in a normal way to expand that same process to a larger World. The other thing I would tend to emphasize is that I don’t think global centers contribute to the undergraduate learning process. Students go out to commercial centers in the rest of the world, and all they get exposed to is commercialism. They’re not going to learn the culture of those countries—they’ll take what’s immediately available in the current culture. It’s just academic tourism, and it doesn’t add up to anything. What do you think the most important impact of a global conversation would be? , Most important would be simply that they’d be able to talk together—and if they talk together, recognizing that they share certain things in common, they can appeal to those common values to deal With their differences. That would apply to any international problem. ."
75,Global Core,"Bollinger talks Global Core, shutdown, M’Ville",7 October 2013,"BY SAMANTHA COONEY ‘ Spectator Senior Staff Writer Spectator sat down with University President Lee Bollinger on Friday to discuss ' the government shutdown, the Arts and Sciences’ budget, construction in Manhattanville, dean searches, his tenure, and more. Q. What are your thoughts on the government shutdown and how it’s affecting Columbia? A. Executive Vice President for_ Research Mike Purdy’s judg- . ment is that as long it stays short term—that’s one to two weeks—there will not be major consequences for the University. So that’s that. Obviously, the debt ceiling is a different story, but that’s a different story for the world. We all know that’s catastrophic. As of right now, there are not signiﬁcant impacts on the University. . Q. Have you been involved inanyconversations about Frontiers of Science lately? A. No. People—Columbia College Dean Jim Valentini, Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Madigan, others—regularly tell me where this issue is, but I’m not playing any role in its resolution. Q. Some have criticized the Global Core’s reach and scope. Is this a concern of yours? A. One of the things I’m most _ concerned swithis orientingthe University more towards global issues. Work has been done to get some funding from Mellon for Work on a global core. My own personal belief is you can take any set of ‘texts of the great teXts——any of -.§yi‘s'%-3‘-‘=.«=»lthem-—and you can talk about b them richly as partof a global ’ understanding. That’s why they’re so great. - ‘i Q. What’s happening with theFifth-Year Fellows Program? A. We suspended it for this yearin the sense that we took a pause. I loved the idea of the Fifth-Year Fellows Program. You would have the option to stay and have a group of faculty work with you to understand global issues and then go off to the Global Centers. It did work for one year, but we want to think about it some more. I’m , sure we’ll reintroduce it, because I really believe in it. The limitation of the idea is that these are students who obviously have left and are leaving. What you want, ideally, is ' students who come back from an experience like that and are then in classes that mean more to them because of that experience and they contribute in ways that are different because of the fact that they’ve had that experience. It’s much harder to introduce reforms in your standard four-year curriculum. Looking forward, you’ll have a class on migration, and in the course of that, studen ts all leave at different times and you’re able to connect by virtual class meetings via Skype and . you really feel that you’re part of a global discussion. We’re not there. Q. I n terms ofManhattanviZle, how are you feelingat the toppingout of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center? , i A. For me, this a huge moment, all these steps along the way. When I started this, it was the idea that Columbia absolutely needed space for an entire half-century or more to grow. It could not thrive and was not thriving in circumstances where it had to expand build- ~ ing by building, block by block. There’s just too much energy, too much frustration in adding physical space to the University. It became my ﬁrst priority. We could create something in Harlem:-our:home+that lar university campus in many respects: no gates, more welcoming, more integrated, with absolutely beautiful buildings and grounds and a 21st-century sense of that. That was the dream. It’s a great thing for the institution. It will be a mental change, it will be a spatial change, it will be a very different feel. Q. What about ﬁindraising for the Business School’s buildings in Manhattanville? A A. The Business School project is still underway. They have not . reached their goal yet, but I’m conﬁdent they will. Q. And what about The Lenfest Center for the Arts? A. All the faculty is hard at work. This will be a spectacular hub. It Will have an absolutely magniﬁcent screening room for ﬁlms, a black box theatre, the Wallach Gallery will be there. It will have public spaces that can be used for artistic"" activities. Q. On to dean searches, what’s happeningwith the search for a new ‘ Law School dean? Have you met with the search committee yet? A. I met with the co-chairs in July and I’ll meet with the search committee in a Week or two. The process is underway. Q. What’s next for the Law School? A. I think there are several things. One—-you would expect me to say this-—is the question of changes in the global economy and the legal landscape. You just need to have more 4 work done on international problems because they’re so signiﬁcant. I also think you have to ﬁgure out what legal education is going to be—its form, its structure, its years. The third year is a real issue and there have been a number of commentaries that‘ you should eliminate the third year. I would keep the third year, and I would provide more experimental forms of learning. Obviously, things like the Global Centers are there to use them and there are many ways to do this. I think also there is a very great need for more funds for students to choose nontraditional career paths. Law school has a very, very ﬁne pool of funds—relative to other schools—for loan forgiveness, but it’s not nearly enough. It’s a common experience for people who go to law school to say they’re not going to Work in big ﬁrms and do good work for the World, but by the second or third year, they’ve changed their mind. And that’s ﬁne, people should be able to change their mind and work in big ﬁrms. But, we should want as a society to make it possible, easier for more students to perform less lucrative, more meaningful legal careers. Q.Are you willing to consider internal and external candidates for the deanship? A. Yes, absolutely. Q. What about the search for a new clean for the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation? VVhat’s next for that school? A. Mark Wigley, Who will step down at the end of the academic year, has been a great dean and a very good friend. And he’s done a wonderful job in making the place an intellectual beehive and taking the school to the world and bringing the school to the world with Studio-X, which is done in collaboration with.»the Global Centers. I think more of that has to happen. I have the sense that the school is very much academically and intellectually alive and vital. They’re very eager to embrace technology, and have a culture of experimentation, and even radicalism, and very much engaged with practical things around the world. There’s a. foundation there for someone to continue these things and have a very big impact. Q. Last week, Spectator talked to Madigan about the Arts and Sciences budget. How can we _ solidify that budget? A: I appointed David, I think the world of him, and I think he’s going to be great. I share his and others’ concerns that we need to get the Arts and Sciences budget richer. The Arts and Sciences at any university will never fund itself, at least at the level that We all Want it to be, because the Arts and Sciences never generates the kind of resources that other schools are able to generate. We stretched this budget, and We have been putting very large amounts of money into the Arts and Sciences over the past decade. We’re hopeful then, through greater collaboration with the College, which is happening, and greater resources coming through other means—fundraising is the principle onethat we are able to increase that budget. Arts and Sciences now has a budget, it is a good budget, it is a solid budget, but we need more funding and we’ve got ways to work on that. Q. Madigan also said that attendance atArts and Sciences faculty meetings have been low. How can attendance at these meetings be increased? A. The way We’re going to get better attendance is to have serious issues raised. An example is the creation of the educational policy committee. That committee will focus on serious questions of courses, majors, undergraduate education, science, any number of issues. You want a system where a committee Works on these things, investigates thesethings, Writes a report, and it comes to the faculty for the decision. The expectation is that we’ll be bring more and more substantive issues to the faculty for advice, but mostly for decision-making. V Q. Have you seen the results for the $3O million diversity initiative the University is pursuing to hire A more diverse‘ faculty? A. One of the ﬁrst things I said to David when I offered him the position, and he accepted, was that we still have to work on diversifying the faculty. It’s not just diversity in terms of a $3O million second— or third-phase program. It’s also the culture of the place, the kinds of subjects We value, the supports we give to people in a variety of ways. And we still have to work on this. We’re a long ways away from where We should be. Q.Are you looking right now to hire a chief digital oﬁicer to replace Sree Sreenivasan? A. Yes——that reports to Provost John Coatsworth. Q. How would you say that structure of havinga digital ojﬁcer is working out in terms of online initiatives? As far as we could tell, there wasn’t a lot going on. A. Well, I think it’s just right. I really mean that. This is probably an area that will be of great signiﬁcance for universities and the World. I don’t have any doubt that this is an area of major change. This is not something that you want to underestimate, in the Way that the press underestimated it 10 years ago, and arguably it’s paying a high cost. On the other hand, you don’t want to jump into these things and spend an enormous amount of resources and energy when you can be just a little bit behind and Watch other people and learn from their mistakes and successes. If you were to name the top places in the country that were experimenting with online education, you knovv, Columbia. wouldn’t be in thattop-ﬁve list; There’s actually a lot more going on here. Q. So what’s going on? A. Well, the big thing is the School _ of Continuing Education, which has developed this very successful hybrid modelcome to the campus and then go off and do things online. This is a big change, there’s no doubt about it You don’t want to underestimate it, but you can also waste a lot of money in it. Q. You’re now the Seth Low , Professor of the University. Why did that come up right now, 11 years into your tenure? Does it change anything for you? A. It doesn’t. It's a very nice, Wonderful honor. The trustees Wanted to do this and do it now, after 11 years. It does many things; I like the association with Seth Low. ‘ But, most importantly, it gives me the freedom to teach in any place in the University. I’ve had that freedom as president, but this gives me the freedom after I step down. This has nothing to do with when I’m stepping down, which remains in the future at some point. I’m making no j plans about when that will be. I’m continuing to act as if I’ll do this forever, which, obviously, is not true. But the kind of illusion that this goes on and on is the right Way to approach this job. It’s a great honor and I’m . very appreciative. Q. So you’ve thought about staying on past2ols, when your current contract expires? A. Yeah. I’m not setting any date at this point.

76,Global Core,Expanding our core,10 October 2013,"BY OLIVIA HARRIS During my sophomore year in Columbia College, I du— ‘ tifully completed my Contemporary Civilization reading, sometimes half-heartedly, but with an interest to begin understanding the thoughts that shaped the modern world. As I read the Lectures on the Philosophy of History by Hegel, i I came across a sentence that has stuck with me to this day. I Hegel’s brief opinion on Africa was as follows: “It is no his- : torical part of the world. It has no movement or development to exhibit.” As my professor began breaking down the theories of zeitgeist, I found myself continuously returning to the absurdities ‘of Hegel’s claim that an entire continent‘ had nothing of import to contribute to world history. I am aware that Hegel is one of Contemporary Civilization’s more bizarre philosophers, but the fact remains that the course proved his point about Africa: We glossed over the writings of an entire continent and centuries of opinions that influenced the world. From the perspective of the Contemporary Civilization student, apparently nothing had ever happened in Africa besides slavery so that W.E.B. Dubois could write about America. As a person of color, I felt a voiceless sense of shame. If I came from a people with noth- Iing to say, how dare I come to this institution and attempt to establish myself within the white world of academia? While it is understandable that Contemporary Civilization covers a very small group of critically important Western European writers, it seems somewhat unfair that the “high points” of the Western canon leave out most of the communities on this Earth. That’s where the Global Core requirement serves an important purpose. But the Global Core isn’t enough, especially when so many of us take our two classes only to satisfy the requirement. Every American schoolchild learns about our nation’s~ forefathers and the European history backdrop to the Revolutionary War. But when will we have the opportunity to learn about Mansa Musa, Haile Selassie, or the Buffalo Soldiers? And if we have come to college to learn new things, how will any of us, regardless of color or ethnicity, understand our place in‘ the world Without knowing what the rest - of the world might look like? How can we, as an institution, pride ourselves in a world-class education that ignores the rest of the world? And even if we sought to . learn about members of the African diaspora, we would still have to go through the Institute for Research in African American Studies, the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African stud- t ies department, and the Latin American and Caribbean studies department to ﬁnd what we were looking for. - But We can unite the African diaspora through studies ofliterature from writers of African descent throughout the world. We can rediscover the voices of those who have historically been silenced or have faded into the background. This is why I have revived the African Diaspora Literary Society on campus. ‘ - Without these elements of history and current events that are not highlighted by current academia and media, we run the risk of missing out on fundamental pieces of our own history. The story of the African diaspora is deeply intertwined with the story of the Americas and Europe and fundamentally inﬂuences how we think of other peoples of color throughout our global system. The African diaspora is a resilient group of people Who, despite great hardship and relocation, has Woven its own tales from the pieces of the scattering. Through the literature of different groups, We can observe the ‘ways that various communities of color are alike and yet distinctive. But this studying is not just for black people only. It is for anyone with desire and interest to hear the other side of the African’s story that is often hidden or not included in the mainstream narrative. Everyone can beneﬁt from\ hearing the voices of all people. And there is always more to the story. The author is a Colulnbia College senior majoring in music. She is the president of the African Diaspora Literary Society. _"
77,Global Core,Different paths to med school,12 November 2013,"i BY ARI SCHUMAN There’s a feeling among premeds that We’re on an assembly line for medical school—that college is just a series of classes to take in preparation for the basic science years of medical school, that clinical volunteering and research are the only valuable extracurriculars, and that if we’re not the best within this set of parameters, then we won’t be able to , get into medical school. But where does this feeling come from? It’s misinformation—a prescriptive standard of medical admissions taken from the Student Doctor Network (and , other online repositories of applicants with 4.0 GPAs and a thousand community service hours) and passed around by word-of-mouth until it became the standard that weaspire to. In all reality, medical school admissions ofﬁcers are more I understanding than We give them credit for. Are GPA, MCAT scores, and certain extracurriculars important? Absolutely. Clinical volunteering, for example, proves that we looked inside of medicine and liked what we saw. But aren’t we more than just medical school applications? Is there more than one path to medical school? What we as premeds sometimes forget is that the.answer to that question is a loud and resounding “Yes.” » » v I This forgetfulness fosters the kind of competitive attitude that makes people dislike premeds. It makes many of us feel like we need to be the best in every class because all an admis- V sions committee will see is a letter grade on an application, and it’s easy to feel like that’s all that matters. That feeling, that focus on grades, makes it very easy to forget where We are. We forget that We’re members of a community, a community that could lend a helping hand to someone who needs it, that could band together through the difﬁcult path to medical school instead of dividing over a bell curve. ‘ When we isolate ourselves from this community, we remove ourselves from a support network, and the path to medical school becomes a solitary march, forced and grueling, instead of the road trip it should be. It’s a corny metaphor, but it works: The path to medical school should not consist of a series of classes taken because they are required, or of a group of extracurriculars that we cram in because they look good on an application. Premed groups on campus should not be a way of padding our résumés, but instead a place for us to band together, help each other, and figure out who We want to be as doctors. We should be willing to meander sometimes, to take a risk, to take a class that’s just interesting, not to worry about which Global Core is an easy A, and to participate in extracurriculars that are just fun. We should be willing to hang out with friends on a Friday night. This is what should happen—but. it’s not what is going on. ' Recently, while speaking in Hamilton Hall, the dean of admissions of Duke’s School of Medicine said that she was looking for students who were willing to ‘fail, students who - could get up after they stumbled. Admittedly, many of us already stumble and fall in our basic premed sciences—but too many of us are afraid to get back up. This doesn’t mean that we should go and fail a class intentionally just so we can show how awesome we are when we get an Ain it the next semester. Instead, this means that we need to be willing to take risks. If you want to be a music major, be a music major. If you want to take that internship with an advertising company downtown, do it! And if you want to do research in a lab, be a bio major, or do anything that we call “traditional,” the more power to you. I It’s become somewhat of a cliché to say that admissions processes are holistic—l went on a lot of college tours, and not a single one told me, “We only look at your GPA and SAT .scores.” However, holism is something that we as premeds too often forget about: We compartmentalize learningbiology and taking Art Hum, but they’re not so different. All of these classes that We’re taking develops the same ability to analyze, to communicate, and to do all of the things that, hopefully, will make us good doctors someday. Not just competent doctors, not just knowledgeable, but doctors able to communicate effectively with patients and share a connection with them. And that’s something every doctor should be able to do.

79,Global Core,STAFF EDITORIAL Where's the Core in Global Core?,20 November 2013,
80,Global Core,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR,25 November 2013,"To the editor: . The editorial titled “Fire M. Dianne Murphy” describes a partial solution for Columbia’s woeful athletic performance. But the solution proposed—for President Bollinger to bring in a new athletic director—does not address the real problem. Columbia Football has had a dismal history for the last 76 years. There have been nine winning seasons since 1937, many years with between zero and two wins, and no winning seasons since 1996. During that period, we have had many coaches and a variety of athletic directors. With each change has come hope, which is then replaced by disappointment and eventual frustration. This awful record speaks to fundamental problems with the football program, problems that the University has never, in three quarters of a century, identiﬁed and/ or articulated. And to a greater or lesser extent, these same problems carry over to many of our other teams. Because we have never identiﬁed the underlying’ problems, each time we have hired a new AD or coach all we have done is put a new face in the same old place. Each time we change, we hope that we have found a solution to our athletic problems, when we don’t even understand what the underlying problems are.It is time for this cycle of futility to end! While I totally agree with your conclusion that for a variety of reasons Murphy must go, I believe that before we repeat history by simply hiring a replacement AD, We should retain a competent, impartial outside consultant that is Q experienced in Working with athletic programs. This consultant should examine all of our programs and interview both past and current athletes, coaches, AD’s, faculty, and administration, as Well as non-athlete-students and alumni, to learn ﬁrst hand why our programs suck. If we get the right consultants and they do an eXcel- l lent job, perhaps they can identify those problems that “ clearly go far beyond the present AD and coaches. Once we have that information, perhaps We can solve these problems with a comprehensive plan that will hopefully l include a total reorganization of the athletic department. But have no illusions that the cures will be simple or inexpensive. And most importantly if they are to be successful, they will require that the entire Columbia community coalesce in support. Only then can the Lion once more Roar!

82,Global Core,In pursuit of social solutions,4 December 2013,"Twice a week last year, I would walk out of my Global Core class, wondering if the world would end be—fore I live to turn 40. Global Urbanism, taught by profes— i,iff:Z. sor Saskia Sassen, is a class with an -I‘ ambitious agenda. By the end of the §AE‘§NA course, Sassen’s students should have s§§&N§AR§ a comprehensive social, economic, and environmental understanding Ke epi 11 g of today’s urban development, how Balance , it happened, and where it’s headed. Spoiler alert: The world is doomed from every angle. One day we’re B h an d al. i learning about the growing inequality gap, extreme poverty, and the exploitation of the poor. Next, We’re discovering that the worldwide water shortage is no longer a problem of the future——it’s a problem of the present. A few weeks later, I sit wide-eyed as Professor Sassen gives us the facts onout-of-control pollution and describesan island of garbage’ twice the size of Texas that floats in the Pacific Ocean. There was a new crisis for every c class, and I would leave/each one feeling despondent. Instead of simply contributing to an academic discussion of a problem, one could shift the academic discourse away from theory and onto solutions. _ Looking back, I shouldn’t have had to. Professors like Sassen and classes like Global Urbanism don’t ‘ have to be Wet blankets for optimistic students. In fact, these professors and classes provide a rare opportunity: They can present their field’s biggest probT lems and also highlight the best solutions to these 1 problems. Sassen is as much a human database as she a l is a leader in her field—which, I believe, makes her a } prime candidate for pitching and endorsing a select group of solutions to the problems that she studies 3 for a living. In fact, all of our professors are experts in their fields. But we tend to look only at theacademia I of hard’ science for solutions to problems. ' I believe that the social sciences, if they are to begin generating solutions to societal problems, must develop the solutions-based mindset that hard sciences foster. Research and education in hard sci- . ences focus on creatingand solving. The emphasis on practice and implementation over theory and history allows hard sciences to explore solutions instead of simply ideas. People like to joke that a liberal arts education is a waste. In reality, the social sciences today face the toughestproblems to tackle. War, poverty, inequality,racism, intolerance, and territorial disputes—these are ‘ problems that can’t be solved by hard science. Instead, they need to be addressed by political science, urban studies, sociology, anthropology, history, economics, ‘ psychology, and other social sciences. But while hard science excels at presenting technical solutions, social science has yet to figure out how to create solutions for society. Why? Social science academia generally does not support solution-based research. Rather, it tends to support theoretical and model-based approaches. That explains why, in many social science classes, students hear their professors talking’ far more about theories and models than potential solutions to major problems within their fields. I understand that theory and modeling form crucial foundations for social science , academia. But, in order for social science fields to , advance—-maybe even inspire a groundbreaking social solutioh—academics need to take a step further in their research and teachings by engaging in solutionbased thinking. i ‘ Of course, some problems are tough to even attempt to answer—who knows the best way to address a trash island twicethe size of Texas? But professors don’t need to present the “right” answer. As long as they include more solution—based material in their syllabi, they will at least be opening channels for solutionbased discussion. Even lectures can be re-formatted I to foster problem—solving thinking: professors present a problem, and then they present potential solutions. Additionally, professors can re-examine their own research and begin a quest to find solutions to the very problems that they have explored. The ability to incorporate progressive thought in an academic setting doesn’t just lie with professbrs, though. Students have incredible power to reform the system, too. I wrote six essays for Global Urbanism, . and they tended to share a similar format: Here’s a major global problem, here’s how it came about, and here’s a final paragraph about the dismal state of p the world. If I could do it over again, I would have changed my format to something like this: Here’s a major global problem, here’s how it came about, and here’s a discussion on current efforts to solve it. p In presentations of research on social problems, solutions shouldn’t be reserved for the concluding remarks. Writing about solutions instead of problems ‘ would most likely require more research-one would need to thoroughly investigate solutions to a problem in addition to investigating the problem itself—but the payoff should be worth it. Instead of simply contributing to an academic discussion of a problem, one could shift the academic discourse away from theory and - onto solutions. I Columbia brings together some of the brightest ideas in the world./If our professors and students were to engage with more solution—based research, the real-world benefits would be spectacular‘. We ‘ . have the necessary intellectual capital to address our world’s toughest problems. What we need now is a push to explore solutions.

For one, CC and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences transfers are now guaranteed on—campus housing. “We understand that transferstudents, having alé ready experienced some level of higher education, have 1 _ some needs that differ from those of traditional firstyear students and a different set of challenges, ” Interim Dean of Student Terry Martinez says m an email. tColumbia deﬁnes a transfer student as someone who has completed at least 24 points of credit (or one year of full—time study), but no more than four semesters, at another institution. Barnard deﬁnes transfer students similarly—these students have completed a minimum of 24 credits, but no more than 60 credits at their previous college. The School of General Studies enrolls transfer . students Who have taken a break of a year or more in their education, but Vice Dean Curtis Rodgers is hesitant to compare GS transfer students to SEAS, CC, and BC transfers. . “Whether students transfer or not is... I don’t . want to say it’s irrelevant, because it’s part of the review...but it’s not the same as a more traditional admissions offlce—like our sister college, Columbia College, Where you apply either as a flrst—-year ' or as a transfer, and it’s sort of a different and separate process,” Rodgers says. i _ As someone who transferred to CC for her sophomore year, I sometimes forget that I didn’t start out here. But the extent to which transfer students feel fully integrated into the community . depends on a combination of factors, including the Ways they have felt supported by the administration and their satisfaction with the culture at Columbia and Barnard. _ A A , HOME SWEET HOME . p S “I Wouldn’t identify myself now as a trans- 3 ~-fer,” Sarah Elrafei, a Barnard junior, says. “I Cdefinitely feel like a student Who’s totally imé mersed herself.” ' ‘ Elrafei entered Barnard after spending her first year at Connecticut College. “It felt very unfulfilling,” she says of her time at Conn. “I felt like a lot of what the school advertised itself to be didnit really come through in the end.” Dissatisfied with career services and the “cliquey” community, and unchallenged by classes, Elrafei decided to re—apply to Barnard, her dream school when she was first applying to college. She Was accepted for fall admission for her sophomore ‘year,’ and quickly found her niche on campus by joining the Columbia Metrotones. “Im~ mediately, right off the bat, that became my family on campus,” she says. ’ ' Monique Bartley, a Barnard sophomore, also had a positive transition, which she partially attributes to living in Elliott Hall——the Barnard dorm with the highest concentration of trans? ferstudents. Elliott has a corri'dor—style living arrangement, Witha common lounge and two . bathrooms and kitchens per ﬂoor—a layout that the school hopeswill be conducive to meeting new people. i . ~ - _ ’ ’ “I know some people had a little bit more trouble if they didn’t live in Elliott, ” ‘she says. .“But ‘for me, I made friends instantly.” ~ » ‘ ~ ’ Hovvever, Barnard has never guaranteed housing for transfer students. ‘ln the fall of 2012, a group of transfers learned first—handjust how short on housing Barnard had be—come. , “They kind of just shoved us anywhere,” Elrafei, who transferred at the height of Barnard’s housing crisis,‘ says. “And I know that it was ‘actually a huge problem my year.” Luckily for Elrafei, she was one of “very, Very few” transfers who received housing, and was placed in Hewitt Hall. Gabby Borenstein, a Barnard junior,~was less fortunate. Three weeks before ori~ _ entation, the housing office notified her that she was unlikely to receive housing, and placed her on a waitlist. Housing also provided her with a link to a website for other students in the ‘same situa— ' tion that “functioned much like an online dating website for finding a roommate, ” Borenstein, now studying abroad in Israel, says in an email. After she met a match, she and her roommate , faced Manhattan real estate on their own. “Re- . ceiving little assistance from the college, it was overwhelming to say the least,” she says. Luckily, Borenstein landed an “amazing” apartment near Plimpton Hall. “Of course, three days after signing the lease, Barnard notified me that they found . [me] housing,”‘she adds. In the end, about 70 transfer students were housed in Elliott, Cathedral Gardens, and Plimpton. Single rooms in Plimpton were converted into crowded double rooms in 7 order to accommodate some students. Although. Borenstein was disappointed that she couldn’t have “the quintessential dorm experience” —the ' reason she transferred to Barnard from the decidedly less campus~centric New York University.she. says’ that the housing situation motivated her to become active in student organizations. ‘ , Across the street, CC and SEAS transfers are guaranteed a home on campus. Before the start of the fall semester, they indicate their residentialpreferences in housing applications, effectively entering the housing lottery with other incoming transfers. Thelapplication links to relevant residence hall pages on the Housing websitefor details, so that students can get an idea of what each dorm is like. I “We make every effort to assign all students according to their stated preferences,” Joyce Jackson, executive director of Columbia Housing, says L in an email. “Since the transfer student popula— i tion is largely comprised of rising sophomores, many prefer to live with other rising sophomores. However, if we have an empty suite due to hous- ' ing cancellations and room transfers, we make an effort to house some transfers together given the preference some have to live together.” . ‘ Of course, it isn’t always possible to respect g these preferences. “I got stuck in the [Living Learning Center],” Corey Stafford, a SEAS senior, says. “I was in Hartley. I nevefsigned up to be there, butﬂthey put me in there, and that was not great at all.” _ I Stafford, who transferred from University _ _ of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was placed on a ﬂoor withpther engineering students. “For lack of a better word, they were a bunch of overeeager, I really nerdy freshmen, ” he says. “And we didn’t W have much in common.” Stafford ended up spending most of his time with transfer friends who lived in East Campus. I Nita_Ponnaganti, a CC senior and a transfer from Rice University, also ended up in a dorm that wasn’t on her list—47 Claremont. “Claremont is the most awkward apartment system ever for ' a group of people that don’t know each other, because there’s noliving space, ” she says. But the odds ended up in her fav‘or—Ponnaganti became such good friends with her roommate that theydecided to live together for the next two years. This fall, 21 transfers were offered a communal living situation in the former Zeta Beta Tau brown—stone, now referred to as the 627 W. 115th St. . residence, after the national fraternity suspended operations at Columbia. “The exceptional availability of this residence for the 2013-14 academic year allowed for the placement of transfer students there,” Jackson says. . ' The residence was unassigned during Room . Selection, so it allowed for some transfer students to be housed together. But this will not necessarily set a precedent for transfers living together, according to Jackson."" Cam Molis, a CC sophomore and a transfer from Georgetown University, describes the living arrangement as “incredible.” e Molis was not only pleased with the size of his room, but also with the community in the house. “The fact that .it’s an all—transfer house, pretty much, really helps for the first couple months to give you a set of people who are all going through the same thing, and who are all with you in the same way that freshmen are with each other when they first come in,” he says. V Stafford says he would have preferred to have had this living arrangement when he transferred to Columbia. “It probably would have helped me meet more people similar to me, rather than being around mostly freshman, ” he says. This year’s transfers were housed in a suite in the Special Interest Communities House, the brownstone on 113th Street, formerly known as the convent. THE COST OF TRANSFERRING_ No matter where a transfer student is housed, feeling like the transition is afforable contributes significantly to a sense of support and belonging. ~ ’Karl Daum, a CC junior and a deputy editorial page editor at Spectator, described the academic and financial support for transfer students as “fucking terrible.” Daum, who transferred from George Wash—ington University at the start of his sophomore S year, ‘was especially disappointed with the way his financial aid package Was handled. “You get the folder, and the acceptance letter’s the first thing, ” he says. “And then right behind it, they give you ’ I your ﬁnancial aid package. And there Was, like, a big fat zero right behind my acceptance letter.” According to Columbia’s Website, the financial aid policy is need—blind for all transfer applicants Who are citizens or permanent residents . of the United States. But the website also states, “We do not guarantee that We can meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for admitted transfer students.” “I’ve heard it says that transfers kind of get the shaft when it comes to financial aid, but A I didn’t think that it Would be so dramatic as zero,” Daum says. . A * But Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid Jessica Marinaccio maintains that many transfer students receive “significant financial aid from Columbia. ” “While We do not guarantee that we can meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for admitted transfer students, Columbia has a very generous ﬁnancial aid program, ” Marinaccio says in-a statement. She emphasized that transfer students, like all undergraduates, are not packaged with loans, and that they are eligible to apply for the summer and academic term work exemption program. Still, Daum says he had to fight to receive aid for his first year. at Columbia. “My parents literally had to go in With me, to the office, and beg,” hesays. “And it wasn’t even like, ‘We’ll reconsider.’ It was, ‘We might put you on the vvaitlist and see What happens.’ ” Columbia offered him some aid the year he transferred, but it took “a lot of begging.” “It was embarrassing, almost, going to that office and asking for financial aid,” Daum says. He later found out that the reason he Was denied aid was because his parents turned in a form late. “So, We essentially got punished for turning a form in I late, by not getting any financial aid, not being considered,” he says. “And I don’t think that’s a a particularly good policy to have. ” This year, Daum didn’t receive any financial aid. “My parents depleted most of their savings accounts to send me here Without the guarantee that they would have a job or income the next month, and Columbia never took that into account, or really seemed tocare to do so.” THE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD T Although Daum felt overlooked, Marinaccio maintains that admitting transfers is “a small but ‘ important part” of the work that the admissions office does. “We believe the entire Columbia com~ munity benefits from the extraordinary enthusiasm, focus and insight that transfer students bring to campus,” she says in an emailﬁs Despite the value that the admissions office places on transfer stu— ‘ dents, Ponnaganti also felt like she didn’t receive much guidance when she first arrived at Colum— ‘ bia. “I think most transfer students recognize that they’re kind of being dumped into a totally new space with not much support, ” she says. “So We go reach out for it, but I think it’s really important for the school to have a system in place that gives us those resources very early on.” 7 Based on What she knows now, Ponnaganti says she Wishes she had structured her time at"
84,Global Core,"Students, faculty value liberal arts at SEAS",28 March 2014,"BY YASEMIN AKCAGUNER Spectator Senior Staﬁ‘Wrz'ter ‘ Unlike most engineering schools, the School of Engineering and Applied Science offers components of a liberal arts education—something SEAS Dean Mary Boyce calls “critical to engineers and scientists of the 21st century.” _ In additionto their technical core courses, SEAS students take a modified version of Columbia College’s Core Curriculum, and SEAS students can elect to take a liberal arts minor. Since 1979, SEAS students have been required to take University Writing and the physical education requirement. They then have a choice"", between taking either Literature Humanities, Contemporary _ Civilization, or a Global Core sequence. They also must choose to take either Art Humanities or Music Humanities. , , ‘fEngineers today live and work in a global, multidisciplinary world with very ﬂuidgboundaries, and it is essential that they have broad-based intellectual skills—that they have the ability to think, Work, and act in both an analytic and synthetic Way, bringing together ideas from diverse fields and merging these into a cohesive, problem-solving approach to world» issues,” Boyce said. . - t In 2002, SEAS began to allow students to take liberal arts minors in English, history; political science, philosophy, music, and architecture—an initiative of the Engineering Student Council.Former Dean Zvi Galil supported the resolution and saw it to fruition. ’ “Engineering education is the best because of the Core. They all cherish the Core.” —former SEAS dean E ‘ Zvi Galil S ‘ “I’m not sure how ‘popular it was a at the time,” Galil said in an interview : last month, adding that he thinks the liberal arts are essential in comple- - menting engineering. “Engineering education is the best because of the Core.

He said that liberal arts is important in the age of the startup, especially as entrepreneurship and . engineering become more closely linked. , V “The collaboration between kids who are coding and kids who are studying literature or political sciencewould be a lot more useful and create C some new innovations we haven’t seen before,” Morgan said; _ Still, Morgan, who took Art Humanities and Contemporary Civilization to fulfill his Core.requirements, said that while he chose Columbia because of its unique C availability of liberal arts courses to SEAS students, there was room for improvement. A - “I think a lot of engineering schools that I considered—say Cornell—don’t _ really offer that. And in schools like Caltech and MIT it gets more extreme. I think that’s one of the great things that Columbia engineering offers its students, the opportunity tointegrate liberal arts and engineering, - but it could definitely get stronger,” Morgan said. Indeed, while other engineer— 0 ing schools across the country have requirements for writing courses. similar to University Writing—like ‘ the communication requirement at MIT, where Boyce used to teachmany don’t» have the_ equivalent of the modified Core required of SEAS. students. Both Stanford and Cornell, paralleling that of many other engineering schools across the country, have requirements in which students can choose from. courses listed under broad categories like Stanford’s . “Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing” and Cornell’s “Cultural Analysis” requirement. V ' Morgan said he wants to see further integration of the Core in the SEAS curriculum requirements. .“It would be great if engineers would take Lit Hum with the rest of Columbia College,” Morgan said. “In terms of the Core, they should definitely make the requirements somewhat stronger and somewhat more integrated with that of Columbia College.” Claire Kao, SEAS ’l4 and a civil engineering major who also took Art Hum and Contempory Civilization, said that she loved her liberalnarts courses and made many Columbia College friends through them. “My friends who aren’t necessarily’ interested in liberal arts, they don’t have to do as much but those who want to can take full advantage of it as I have and as Ryan [Morgan] has,” Kao said. “I think people who come to Columbia engineering are self-selec- ° tive, they know that this is the place where you can do both.” , . _ . V I ‘ Kao also said that the fact that she has taken various liberal arts courses outside of her technical requirements helped her advance in her professional life. ' “I get to talk about the fact that I’ve taken a philosophy course and studio and languages,” Kao said. “People are really interested in the fact that I have this quantitative background and also supplemented it and had other interests.” I Various SEAS faculty members, like Upmanu Lall, a professor of civil engineering and earth and environmental engineering, have also acknowledged the role of liberal arts within their disciplines and research.“The education in the political and social sciences, and psychology inﬂuences what an engineerdesigns for and thinks about marketing their innovations,” Lall said. “Philosophy influences how we think about what we work on, and how to rationalize choices we make as to directions of research and their value.” Julia Hirschberg, the computer science department chair, said that liberal arts is an increasingly important part of SEAS, in both education and research, especially as its research grows more interdisciplinary. . “We often connect with faculty and students in the liberal arts at Columbia to discuss computational aspects of projects they are doing and sometimes to collaborate,” Hirschberg said. “We work with researchers in the humanities and social sciences and often exchange talks and meetings.” ’ Though Boyce said that there are no current plans to change the role of liberal arts in the SEA‘S curriculum, the increasing demand for interdisciplinary research and work is causing more demand for the integration of the liberal arts in the technical curriculum. “We are exploring different _ave- * nues for enhancing our engineering curriculum to further enhance creativity‘ and innovation throughout the curriculum and cocurricular activities,” she said.

85,Global Core,Add course on gender and identity to Core,9 April 2014,"BY ABBY MITCHELL V ' ‘ At a 1987 lecture in Low Memorial Library, English professor Carolyn Heilbrtm took on Columbia’s greatest institution: the Core Curriculum. Heilbrun said, “In recent years the educational establishment in the United States, and those in charge of teaching the humanities in the universities, have insisted upon the importance of our ‘legacy’ and of the connection of that ‘legacy’ to the ‘life of the mind’ and to certain unchanging truths. The entrance of women students into almost every male college and university raises the question of how political the protection of that ‘legacy’ is and what effect the changing lives of women in our society should have upon university policy.” . She continued, “The academic community must face the necessity of moving women from the margins of universities to their center. Not to do so will indicate the degree to which the male tradition has dictated _ what questions we may ask of our universities, our C ‘legacy,’ and of our ‘old fashioned values?” l Nearly 30 years after Heilbrun’s speech, this is still a central problem created by the Core Curriculum. Our administration protects the Core tooth and nail, yet we rarely question whether it’s teaching us all the ' right lessons or exposing us to the well-rounded legacy ’ we deserve from our education. l’m a Columbia College woman who has completj ed the Core. And, by and large, I’m a fan of the Core Curriculum. At a school like Columbia, where athlet- ' ics do not shape University life, the Core ﬁlls that void. It’s what you bring up when you’re feeling awkward at a networking event or if you happen to be seated next to an alum on a plane. Put bluntly, you can’t ﬁnd a living Columbia alum who hasn’t suffered through g‘ Homer and Plato. The Core is nearly 100 years old and V not going anywhere. ‘ Women, by contrast, have been at ColumbiaCollege for only 30 years. This disparity demonstrates an inevitable truth of the “legacy” of the Core: It was not designed for or by women. Indeed, the father of the Core Curriculum, professor John Erskine, CC 1900, saw the Core as a means to prevent the incursion of women. a In 1936, he wrote an essay called “The Inﬂuence of Women and Its Cure.” In Erskine’s words, “Let the boys be taught by men and encouraged to be masculine—not to imitate the manners of the cave dweller but to cultivate initiative, persistence, backbone.” He wrote, “If the older American stocks won’t pass on their tradition the path of our ideas will be rapidly changed. Or, if the men won’t teach and- the women Will, the balance of the sexes will be upset and ours will be a feminine civilization.” . V Those sentiments may be kept out of his shrine in Hamilton Hall, but they demonstrate the central bias ' of the “unchanging truths” in the Core Curriculum: a desire to preserve tradition——speciﬁcally, a maledominated tradition—in the minds of youths. Looking at our Core today, you’ll see efforts toWard inclusivity: the addition of authors like Virginia Woolf and Mary Wollstonecraft or texts like Lysistrata and Medea. Despite popular opinion, there certainly were Women writing and theorizing before modern times——one such example would be 17th-century author Madame de Lafayette, who enjoyed a brief stint . on the Literature Humanities course list Devoting one class session to suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s The Woman’s Bible, a 19th-century bible revision meant to challenge patriarchy in religion, would certainly spice up the notoriously dull religious portion of Contemporary Civilization. But it Wouldn’t be productive to argue for total equality in gender distribution in the Core. Adding a book entails removing another, and most of the Core’s old white dudes are here to stay. However, its important that we all recognize that,in a college Where over 50 percent of the student body is female, women are relatively absent from the courses and reading lists considered most necessary to our education. We cannot continue to dismiss this problem in defense of “legacy.” V If the Global Core requirement is meant to account for bias toward Western thought—-as flawed as that requirement might be——it’s high time to consider an addition to adjust for the masculine bias. Anyone who has taken acourse in women and gender studies can tell you the classes are generallyoverwhelmingly female. The same, of course, can be said for classes on race and ethnicity and students of color. Identifying with a topic makes you more likely to want to engage with it intellectually. ' Among its many other virtues, the Core creates a captive audience: A student who has no intention of studying philosophy or classics is forced to do so in a class that demands participation and effort. You can’t avoid the Core or its seminar setting. Yet this compulsory aspect of the Core creates a unique opportunity for Columbia to challenge students in the very topic it now so staunchly ignores. If the University were to add a course devoted to questions of identity, gender, and bias, the College would not only engage an untapped branch of historical and philosophical thinking, but in doing ‘so, Columbia College would also challenge its own history. I can only imagine all of the possibilities that such a course could hold and all of the amazing women who could form its backbone. . We need a Core Curriculum in which women are not relegated to the margins or thrown in haphazardly in the name of equality. If the goal of the Core is to better prepare us for life and expand our way of thinking, then perhaps it should start with an expansion of its own limited perspective.

86,Global Core,Create a separate class to explore women’s writing,9 April 2014,"BY BRITT FOSSUM Barnard College’s First-Year Foundations courses, First-Year Seminar and First-Year English, are a required part of the—Barnard curriculum for all students. Unlike Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, these classes don’t share a syllabus of texts but rather have speciﬁc focal topics. One is dedicated to “Women and Culture.” The two other major literature courses’ syllabi, on the other hand, are full of male writers and thinkers, though one of the two does include several writers excluded from Literature ‘ Humanities, such as Margery Kempe, Madame de Lafayette, and Mary Shelley. A different focus is needed in order to deal with female voices because of a disappointing truth about the past: The writers and philosophers we acknowledge and celebrate were not women. Even the inclusion of the aforementioned writers is somewhat questionable. Were the texts The Book of Margery Kempe, The Princesse den Cleves, or even Frankenstein truly so signiﬁcant.in their time that they warrant sharing a syllabus with Don Quixote or the Odyssey? Texts included in the Core Curriculum must be signiﬁcant today. But when these classes are also framed as part of a study of Western thought, the texts must have been inﬂuential in their own time periods. The syllabus for Literature Humanities, for example, is carefully put together (and sometimes modiﬁed by professors) to ﬁt a particular pattern of Western thought; the rise of interiority and the inner self. This process culminates in Virginia Woolf—her To the Lighthouse is difﬁcult to read and downright armoying, but it really is the perfect book to ﬁnish Lit Hum with, as an example of internal narrative. ,But does it reallybeneﬁt the Core Curriculum to throw in additional female writers just for the sake of having more female voices? ' Columbia can’t improve the Core byethrowing in gratuitous female writers. By limiting the scope of Core classes to the traditional canon of literature and philosophy, ﬁrst-years will read Jane Austen as the ﬁrst female writer. Is there really any way around this? All We have left is scraps of Sappho’s poetry and a few works by medieval writers and theologians. There are, of course, excellent female vvriters——it is just that the set criteria that deﬁne the Core Curriculum must exclude them. Finding female writers who inﬂuenced mainstream thought in their time requires broadening the scope of the Core syllabus. What of Lady Murasaki’s The Tale of Genji? As a Japanese writer, Lady-Murasaki clearly wrote outside of the Western tradition. Similarly, women writers, even’those‘considered to be from the Western world, also-wrote outside of the Western tradition of the time, which largely excluded women. . * Would anyone really choose ‘to drop Inferno in favor of a lesser (or lesser-known and referenced) work just for the sake of adding another woman’s name to the list? In this vein, some Contemporary Civilization professors- choose to teach John Stuart Mill’s The Subjection ofWomen instead of Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman because Mill’s text is more rigorous and well-written. So why not do as Barnard has done and add the option of a women’s studies course to the Core? We have Global Core classes to present a non-Western viewpoint (another critique of the Core), so why not also focus on women in a‘ separate class? There are plenty of fascinating courses that focus on women and literature by women, but Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and Art and Music Humanities have very different foci. They are stuvey courses, and unfortunately for women throughout history, only in very recent centuries have Women been free enough in society to show up on a “greatest hits” list of inﬂuential thinkers. . _ Adding extra women to the Core constructs a false history—-one where women were able to have their thoughts celebrated and held to the same standards as men. We don’t need to have women’s works lumped into a narrative of philosophical development from which their Works were forcibly excluded or never had the chance to exist. The great women of history deserve their own narrative— one that is very different from that of the traditional Western canon. A Britt Fossum is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in chemistry.

87,Global Core,I WOKE UP LIKE THIS,24 April 2014,"FOLLOWING FOUR (OLUMBIAN9Ev FINN VIGELAN3ILLUSTRATED BY ANNA ESPINOLAAt Columbia—where never taking an 8:40 a.m. class is a badge of honor, and where Butler’s 24-hour schedule makes for many late nights—it’s easy to lose, or not care about, one’s morning routine. Breakfast becomes brunch, and “getting ready” happens in a 15-minute ﬂurry between an alarm and a 10:10 class. For me, a former Spectator editor, mornings were what you hoped you never ' met after a long night in the office: But as I gear up for post grad life, there’s a part of me that’s jealous’ of people who have the time, will, and energy to ‘start their day before they start their day. \ A recent Harvard Business Review post reinforced the feeling that I’m missing out on something by having a morning scramble instead of a morning routine. The article, pulling from a new book called Daily Rituals: How Artists Work, documents the seemingly mundane, if regular, elements to many great ' thinkers’ days: minimal distractions, walks, and a division between “injportant work and busywork. ” . I reached out to different corners of campus and found two administrators I and two students willing to let me tag along on their morning routines in an attempt to find out what I’ve been missing out on. ‘ e A A WALK IN THE PARK g It takes quite an effort to get out of bed to meet Terry Martinez at 7 a.m., but I make it. When I get to the corner of 112th Street and Broadway, the interim dean of student affairs is in front of Tom’s ina neon pink jacket, tying her shoes, admiring a neighbor’s dog, and ready to go. ~ ._ _ So; first things first: I ask her if she is a morning person. . “Not at all!” she laughs. “No. I was kind of hesitant because I usually just put my headphones in and don’t talk to anyone. This is my quiet time. I was wondering, ‘Am I even going to have anything to say?’ I don’t like to talk before the double digits. That’s like reading time, email time, quiet time.’’ 4"" i In fact, she went to bed at 2:30 last night, not too long before I did. She says she regularly sleeps just fivehours a night. ‘ _ »“That’s not something I can sustain for an entire semester, but when . things get busy in the academic year, I can do it~—as long as I do things like this,” she says.Martinezis referring to the calming 39-minute walk we are embarking on‘through Riverside Park, down to 96th, and to her apartment building—that she . “takes to ease into the day.

College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science. V Martinez said in November that she was not intent on staying in the interim position permanently. “I like my other job, M daym—to—day on—the— ground contact with students,” she told Spec last semester.

She will report directly to Shollen . iberger at Hopkins and oversee the construc~ _‘tion of new residence halls there. She hasn’t spoken publicly about why she’s leaving, l and we avoid the topic on our walk. In fact, we barely discuss Columbia at all. I get the sense that this walk is often the only escape she has from the chaos of Lerner Hall. The semi—regular cast of characters she ""encounters is strictly anonymous. N 0 Walking partners for her, and certainly not any co—workers. “There’s a men’s soccer league, so that’s where those guys are going down there, ” she says, pointing to a dozen guys in tracksuits.

I_-lepwalks slowly because the dog is so old. ”~ Today he’s got two dogs, which suriprises Martinez. “Look at that—l’ve never seen that one before.” A man passes us on a scooter, and Mar-adults on scooters. I know it’s a mode of - transportation, but it just looks silly.” These musings aren’t mundane—they’re the way she gears up for a day in the ColumI bia administration. “In the morning, my brain just needs to wander, ” she says. “It’s not as focused.” ' Before we met at Tom’s, Martinez had only a very brief routine that morning. “I check my email flrst—unfortunately just to see if there’s anything that happened overnight, ” she sighs. Martinez has responded to many a Spectator inquiry in the middle of the night before. v As mental fodder for the walk, she says she likes to read a short article or two before leaving the apartment. “I get Inside Higher Education in the morning, and then I check my Twitter feed, because there’s always some great Harvard Business Review or something like that—something I can read ’ really quickly——and if there’s nothing else I think about that, ” she says. Maybe Martinez prefers the solitary stroll because it’s the closest thing she has to home when she’s in Manhattan. She used to work at Ithaca College, and her husband still lives in their house there. They alternate commutes, seeing each other on weekends. “We have what we call joint custody of our dog, ” she laughs. She’s the kind of New Yorker who loves Riverside “because people don’t keep their dogs on leashes.” ’ “When I’m walking upstate, I don’t see anybody,” she says. She tries to name the sights: deer, oxen, cows, the lake at the foot of the hill her house is on. “There’s just nothing.” I leave her on the doorstep to her building on 112th.

College sophomore, turns to me and looks I: hopeful. “You’re Jewish... right?” 1’ With a sad shake of my head, I let him down, and Strobel heads back out of the room and gets on his phone again. He’s .; trying to dig up a 10th man so that group iii prayer for Hillel’s Yavneh morning services may begin. But it’s the first day after Pass—over, and many of the Columbia’s Orthodox Jews are just getting back to campus or are still en route from home. ‘While we wait, it’s time for individual * prayer. The men wraptheir tefillin around their arm and bounce on the balls of ' ;_ their feet, reading the Torah under their breath. It’s very peaceful. Someone opens ’--""I: a window, allowing just a bit of Broadway 1: traffic noise to make its way into the fifth ﬂoor room of the Kraft Center. But Strobel _;:{ hasn’t really been able to partake in any of it yet. As one of Yavneh’s three gabbais—people tasked with ensuring the services ,3’ are staffed—he’s on his phone, trying to make quorum. “ Atlast, Man No. 10 walks in, and we dive into group prayer. The Hebrew is read at an exceptional speed, and it’s all over pretty I; quickly. People have to get to their 8:40s, after all. “Usually it doesn’t cut this close!” Stro—bel assures me. _ After he puts away the tefillin, we walk downstairs and out to 115th Street. The first hour and a half of Strobel’s day is conve—niently confined to a single block: .He wakes up in Schapiro Hall, crosses to the KraftWilliams, andeats it back in S-cha-piro. He’s one of a not insignificant number of Jewish students who live in Schapiro. Kraft across the street “is a big . incentive. It makes my commute shorter, ” he chuckles. _ With a daily alarm clock at 7:30 a.m., .Strobel’s is probably one of the more rigidly structured of college students’ mornI ask him how the constant of morn~ ping prayer affects the way he plans out his day or week. V.""};‘:_ “I like it in the sense that it provides structure. I mean, part of What it’s about is it structures your day. There’s prayer I: 7!; three times a day,” he says. “It’s definitely struggle, because I feel like I have to prioritize at night—l could end up Workif‘ ing really late, but I know I have to get up every morning by 7:30.” _ ~ ;_ , Hillel is one of the largest student organizations on campus, both religiously and socially, and Strobel likes that he can ff ence. The Jewish community on campus, . he says, “is ""definitely more than just about ritual service. It’s deﬁnitely a social. community, and I think it provides a lot of that people.” He considers his leadership role a way to give back to the community, but his position requires himto toe the line between and religious official. “In this posi— I tion, I don’t feel like I should beimpos— Sf’ ing—like, ‘Oh, you should really come.’ I {jg}. very far from that. At the same time, p that partake in this community f}§,;:.' in a sense feel a communalobliga—:[§;’§7 and hopefully through that they’ll motivated to come and be a part of the s;;.;f}{, daily routine of prayers. ” I E - Since Passover has only just finished, E Strobel heads to Morton this morning for a instead of eating cereal on the fifthyet another opportunity for a communal, ~ social morning. “It’s very mucha community, in that it’s a lot of people that come from similar backgrounds that can relate Very easily to each other.” * I ask him a question that’s probably pretty hard to answer, but I ’ye been asking everyone I’Ve interviewed: If services Weren’t bound to the morning, would he consider himself a morning person? He pauses, since this regimen is so deeply ingrained in his identity. “I would certainly be Waking up later, I think. Roll I out of bed into class. I’m not saying I would sleep till noon, but I think I would sleep until 9—at least a little bit later. ” The regularity of prayer, he says, “is definitely something that makes time a little more Valuable.” THE ART OF CONVERSATION As Columbia College Dean James Valentini leans over to clean up after his dog, former CC/ SEAS Dean of Students Roger Lehecka jogs past. “Don’t you pick up enough of this at work every day?” Lehecka cries. I Valentini quips back, “Yeah, this is my morning practice. 7’ . His dog, Fosco, is a brown toy poodle. The name is the Italian word for “dark”; Valentini’s Wife, Teodolinda Barolini, is I the chair of the Italian department. “Everybody knows Fosco,” Valentini says as We get into his building’s elevator, having just passed a maintenance man who , greets the dog eagerly. Valentini is an affable man who frequently calls hisdeanship “the best job at the best school in the best city in the world.” In July 2012, just after Valentini was bumped up from interim to “permanent dean” (a term he always laughs at“some day I’ll stop being dean,” he says), Ia “populist dean,” with his embrace of the nickname “Deantini” as exhibit A. When I interviewed Valentini for Spectator, he often said he wasn’t pre—pared to share his own opinion because he T-5153; hadn’t gotten a good enough sense of what sthdents and alumni thought about a given fflf issue. This was frustrating to me at times. But I realize on this April morning that his reticence was the sign of a genuinely §:_f_j curious person who wants to know his students better. I Valentini says that Sydney Schwartz Gross, the college’s director of commu—nications, has gotten to know him well enough that “she has kind of got these Valentini—isms down pat.” If anything, the time Valentini and I spend together—in . which he generously gives me the fullest I picture of his morning, from dog walk to pastry hunt—is a case study in Valentini—isms. Charming and a little dopey, they have a certain je ne sais quoi. For instance, we’re walking up 112th from Riverside, and I note that we appear to be headed for the laundry I sometimes ff use, right across from the side entrance to jgjl-=7 the Spec office. Valentini registers which storefront I’m talking about and pauses for _:‘§f-7‘ a split second. ' “I forgot I’m not supposed to go this :75"" way!” he says. “The reason is, there’s two laundries. One’s on this street, the old Chinese guy. And my wife takes some stuff there that the other laundry [at the corner] 5., won’t do, and she’s worried he gets upset ;;T_:§_.jj§ if he sees me. But they’re terrible with my shirts. ” As we pass the shirt—mishandling laundry, I’m on Valentini’s left. “You’re f’;f:sf blocking my view, so it’s OK, ” he adds. We somehow get to talking about the sunrise. “I’ve always arranged to have an if535?:l office that faces south, because I like the sun in the winter. It’s low, ” he says. That"

I was not yet four years old at the time. My parents and I had recently . moved to the United States from Delhi, and it was my first day of prekindergarten. Presumably, my teacher was unable to pronounce my name correctly, calling me “Per—ule” instead. It didn’t occur to my mother or me to correct her, and so the name. stuck. No teacher or student would call me any other name until I arrived at Columbia. I V ' I , Yet even here, only Indian—American and international students typi— _ cally know how to pronounce my name. To most, I am “Per—ule. ” A year ago, I was standing in the doorway of my friend’s dorm room, and the topic of my name came up. My friendman international student from India~«had been pronouncing my name in the proper way— “PAI-I—rull” since-we first met a year and a half earlier. . i I “Would you prefer I call you ‘Per—rule’ ? ” he asked. The question startled me. I laughed. “What? Of course not, What gave youthat idea?-” “Well, that’s what everyone else calls you, and that’s how you refer to yourself, so I realized maybe that’s what you prefer to be called,” he said. I shook my head. “No. I mean, yes, it’s true that’s what I call myself. But I prefer the way you say it. Keep calling me ‘PAH—rull,’.please, I prefer it.” A I I The same‘ friend told me two days later that he feels perfectly American. Considering he’s an international studenf, his statementstruck me as bold. I’d always felt an odd sense of pride at being able to tell my cousins and grandparents in India that after 16—plus years in America, I finally consid—; ered myself- fully assimilated. Who was he to so quickly assert ownership over a piece of this country? I ' ._ “You seem completely American, too,” he told me. . “Sometimes I think that’s a bad thing,” I said. “I’m so divorced from my culture I don_’t even tell people how to properly pronounce my name.” _ “But there’s nothing wrong with that, ” he responded. “You can choose to call yourself whatever you Want. It’s your name. And deciding to pronounce it a little differently doesn’tlmean you’re rejecting your culture.” ’ At. the time, my friend’s statement was exactly what I needed to hear. That’s right, I told myself. You can call yourself whatever you want. It has . nothing to do with being Indian or not. , . - § When I was younger, I laughed at my mother’s suggestion that I learn ’ Indian classical dance. I objected vehemently to her suggestion that I learn to prepare Indian food. Though the language was my first, my speaking E skills have deteriorated over the years. My cousins in India make fun of my : horrible pronunciation, my inability to properly enunciate the difference 3 between “ka” and “kha,” “ga” and “igha.” 3 Back -in high school, when my friends and teachers would ask if I knew E Hindi, Iwould murnble a quick and quiet “not really.” It was easier to say I E I’d forgotten the language than it was to explain.how weird it felt to speak 3 the language in front of non—family members. It felt immodest and awk- § ward, like I was exposing a part of myself that was meant to remain hid-den. And I guess I felt the same way about my name. At my predominantly white high school, going by “PAH—rull” felt out of the question. Senior year of high school, it ﬁnally started to bother me that none of ' my friends knew how to say my name. So I resolved to revert to the proper g pronunciation once in college. Of course, that didn~’t actually happen. When I first enrolled here, I wasn’t feeling particularly bold. New York was daunting. School was daunting. And I figured going by “Per—ule” would be easier, ‘more natural. More me. I But it Wasn’t. . ° . ' Helje,',my Indian heritage is nothing exotic. Here, it has become an A . ‘ easy point of conversation, a way to connect with and relate to others. My friends come from diverse racial backgrounds. And almost every Indian student I’ve met at Columbia has returned my introduction with a confused look and a raised eyebrow. “You mean ‘PAH—rull,’ right?” Because of those skeptical looks, or because of the Indian culture and history classesil took to fulﬁll Global Core, or because of the sheer number of Indian or otherwise racially diverse friends I’ve made at Columbia—something has changed. « Now, I find myself ﬂaunting my barely existent. Hindi abilities at every opportunity I get. I find myself lamenting my inability to prepare Indian cuisine or dance bhangra or read Hindi. Whenever I meet another Indian student or attend a Club Zamana event, I find myself feeling inadequate—as though I’m not Indian enough. If that even makes sense. If Indian—ness is even something you can quantify and measure. I I . I At the same time, I can’t help but wonder if choosing togo by my ‘ Americanized name means I’m still hesitant to embrace my Indian roots. Haven’t we always been told—by movies, literature, and society——that it’s our duty to uncover as much as we can about our parents, our ancestry, our culture? Isn’t that the final step inthe Hero’s Quest narrative? Isn’t it ’ impossible for us to truly know ourselves without knowing our background and roots first? . . ’ ’ I could try to spin my decision to forgo my real name as an act of agency. I could argue that I choose to be called “Pe_r~ule” becauseit frees me from any immediately recognizable cultural tie. It is both Indian and American, and in that way it is also neither. It is unique,'a refusal to conform. But I know that. isn’t true. I so badly want it to be a form of agency, of assertion. But my greatest discomfort with continuing to go by “Per~ule” is that I fear it is not an active choice so much as a passive acceptance. I fear thatgoing by “Per—ule” is a form of not choosing, of continuing with the status’ quo because doing soiseasier than trying to re—establish my identity. Then again, maybe I’m being too hard on myself. Maybe reclaiming your identity isn’t as simple as ﬂipping on a light switch. ‘Maybe it’s ‘a gradual process of reﬂection and mental preparation. My Indian friends already call me by my real name, and I recently told one of my non—lndian friends to call me by it as well. Maybe it’s just a matter of time before I’ll be able to ‘ introduce myself genuinely to every stranger I meet. ‘ But until then—to anyone reading this—my name is pronounced “PAHrull.” It’s not so hard to say. And if you want me to sound it out for you, just ask. . ‘ ."
89,Global Core,Boyce renews spirit at SEAS,29 October 2015,"New InltlatlVes, faculty hll'€S school Spectator Senior Staff Writer Two and a half years into her tenure, School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Mary Boyce has brought renewed en- t ergy to the school, sparking the"" creation of a series of initiatives that has reanimated both faculty and students. ' Columbia trumpeted Boyce’s appointment as a high-pro-ﬁle hire in March 2013 after the University stole Boyce away from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where ‘ she had taught for over 25 years. Her appointment marked the end of a Volatile decade for SEAS, following former Dean ' Feniosky Peﬁa-Mora’s resignation after SEAS faculty passed a vote of “no conﬁdence” in him. Her appointment helped put SEAS on the map, according to Robert McCaughey, a history professor at Barnard and the author of “A Lever Long Enough: A History of Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science Since 1864.” “She is an important person in her discipline, coming fromthe top engineering school in the. world, a member of the National Academy of Engineering. She came in with instant impact in terms of the visibility of the institution,” Mccaugheyésaid. “And then from everything I hear, she’s "" performed as expected.” ' According to administrators, faculty and students inter- » viewed by Spectator, Boyce has successfully fostered interdis- ' ciplinary collaboration with the other schools at the University, S authorizeda series of signiﬁcant renovations, and worked to emphasize to students how exciting engineering is. “I think Columbia missed a coupleof turns in the wheel , when engineering was revived in the ‘6os and ‘7os, and places like MIT and Stanford re- . ally took advantage of them and Columbia kind of fumbled along,” McCaughey said. “This round, I think Columbia has moved as smartly as any.” _ I TRANSCENDING DISCIPLINES A central tenet of Boyce’s vision is to enable engineering students and faculty to tackle _ the “global challenges of the ‘ world” through interdisciplinary work. “We’re looking now that our engineering education is a foundational education,” Boyce said. ’ “At the undergraduate level, we do consider a key part of that [to be] our requirement of a part of the core curriculum, because we think that also informs the broader perspectiveof our role in the world, and how engineeringcomes to bear on that.” Engineering students * at Columbia are required to take half of the humanities core; they choose between Literature Humanities, ‘ Contemporary Civilization, or V two Global Core courses, and either Art Humanities or Music Humanities. The approach is one that Boyce believes distinguishes SEAS from its peers and appeals to. students who value interdisciplinary collaboration. V “We are attracting students who seeengineering in that foundational way,” Boyce said. “So I do think we attract anincredible talent that is broader than what you mightsee in some other top engineering schools.” V 4 .According to McCaughey, Boyce’s interest in pursuing interdisciplinary work is the_ continuation of work that administrators at SEAS began in the 19905. . ' ' “I don’t think [the emphasis on transdisciplinary collaboration] can be attributed to the most recent clean, but I think what Dean Boyce. has ' recognized is that that is one . of the key elements in the perceived success of_ the institution and engineering school,” McCaughey, said. “And I think it’s now the case that you cannot , think seriously of any collaboration within the University that does not include the engineering school.” i According to Soulaymane Kachani, senior vice dean for academic programs at SEAS, past administrators had also hoped to foster interschool, collaboration, but there was “nothing that was meaningful that came with that” “until Boyce came to campus. “She came here and said,‘ ‘We have to ""cross to all the schools, to all the disciplines, and see where we can add value,”’ Kachani said. “It’s not like we ' weren’t doing that before, [but] I donit think we were doing it in an organized way.” One of the most notable ex— ’ amples of this visionhas been‘ the creation of the Ebola design challenge in 2014. The challenge, which spanned the . course’ of two weeks, tasked participants from SEAS and the Mailman School of Public Health to work in teams to develop a low—cost, technology- » driven -solution that would meet a challenge‘ posed by’ the outbreak of Ebola. The chalv lenge sparked‘ the creation of Highlight, a powdered bleach additive that can beused to decontaminate infectious diseases. The invention won the USAID Fighting ‘Ebola Grand » ‘Challenge and has sincebeen r incorporated into the New York City Fire Department’s HazMat unit decontamination protocol. ' r Boyce, who created the event after discussing the Ebola crisiswith Mailman School of Public Health Dean Linda Fried, herself participated in the challenge, serving as a research adviser. .. . _ Ritish Patnaik,’ SEAS ’l6, A praised the event, and noted that it allowed him to work with Boyce not in the capacity of anadministrator, but as a researcher. . “I came to the Ebola design challenge kickoff presentation, and I was interested‘ in the idea . of protective suits. The next day, . Dean Boyce is sitting there, and she’s sketching out a suit, and I had a sketch‘ of a suit in my backpack, and we sat down and started compiling our sketches , and working together,” Patnaik said. . “She would take time out of her day to come down to the BME [biomedical engineering] ‘ lab just to see how things were going, to see‘ if she could give us advice,” he added. Boyce also has worked to collaborate with the Business School, spearheading the? creation of a new class called . Research to Revenue-, which will be offered to business and engineering students in the first V half of sprilngsyemester. The course will encourage students to work in teams to tackle both -the technical and entrepreneur- . ial challenges of developing technology. ‘ . » “Something Dean Boyce v wants to do is not just think, about these ideas, but really do them. And that’s why we are offering this as soon as possible, not waiting until next year,” Sam Sia, an associate professor of biomedical engineering who is helping to craft the course, said. “We want to"",d9_.-,_it now “and we want to giveiiltlsltadents resources now.” I a . INVESTMENTS IN FACULTY AND SPACE Perhaps the largest challenge facing SEAS‘ that Boyce habislought to tackle has been I ' the school’s space constraints. »Crunch_ed for laboratory space, faculty and students havehistorically felt the coiggequences of Columbia’s spaéellimitations acutely. This probl3ﬁ%*that has directly affected tl3l:el'school’s V ability to competitively recruit faculty.*""‘lt’s a limiting factor. You want to be able to do your research, and you need to have the space to do your research. It’s probably how you’re going to A get tenure,” David Vallancourt, . a senior lecturer in circuits and systems in the department of electrical engineering, said. ' But under Boyce’s leadership, SEAS has invested in a series of renovations, expanding S and refurbishing lab and ofﬁce spaces. ‘ . = ' “We’re undergoing some rathermassive renovations to build out and bring more labs up to the level we need to be at for the type of work we’re doing. That’s a major priority of the school,” Boyce said. “We have a big effort to try to bring our current spaces up to , the level where I think we need ‘ to be.” ‘ g A A Those construction proj-« ects have included renovations to biomedical engineering and electrical engineering teaching labs, the creation of an ' electron microscopy labora- . tory, and the creation of 8,400 square feet of faculty office space, conference rooms, and i open areas for research collaboration and meetings for the Data Science Institute. SEAS has also been. allot- . ted a plotof land on the new . Manhattanville campus. “She has the passion to crev ate not only physical space that satisfies ‘faculty need, but . she thinks about ‘how do we, make it long term and beneﬁcial and sustainable and efﬁcient,”’ SEAS Senior Executive Vice Dean Shih-Fu Chang said. “When you. create a space, it makes sense to invest a little more today so you can later on use this infrastructure.” . The investments in creating laboratory and ofﬁce space have also facilitated an increase in faculty hires—-22 new faculty members have joined SEAS in .i the past year‘ alone: ' '1 ""“lsean""B""oyee has».deﬁnite'ly~ made hiring of world class faculty a priority}? Garud Iyengar, the chair of the industrial engineering and operations research department, wrote in an email, “lEOR has added four new faclrulty since she arrived on campus. This is approximately a 20 percent increase in the facultyS count. And we are looking to hire two more faculty members this year.” According to Kachani, the expansion in faculty hires is . indicative of the dynamic vision Boyce brought with her to ’ SEAS. . “She came and she said, ‘We’ have to be a lot more risk taking. So instead of growing modestly over many years, let’s make ‘bold movement of growing the school from _a faculty side, enhancing. our structure and we will ﬁgure it out,”’ Kachani said. “To be honest, previous deans would not have done what Mary has done. They would have done it at a slower pace.” A r MAKING ENGINEERING EXCITING A V ' For decades, aperception ex- . isted that SEAS did not receive the recognition it deserved . within the University, with former dean ZviGalil once de- A scribing it as an “adopted child.” “I think Columbia has taken. ' a very long time to recognize the‘ importance of an applied science component to a real university,” McCaughey said. “Now that’s totally gone.” . But even as thelschool has ireclleivedlgreater recognition, Boyce is still working to distinguish the school, emphasiz- . ing to both SEAS students and members of the University community that engineering is “an incredible ﬁeld to be in.” V . “We want to really celebrate the incredible projects students do as part of their curr_iculum and to really-open that up to the entire Columbia community to see what great things our students are doing,” Boyce said.‘ To fostenexcitement, Boyce revamped the annual schoolS wide senior design exposition that showcases the culmination of graduating seniors’ work. Once a series of small, informal "" departmental events, Boyce created a single school-wide event in Lerner‘ Hall to highlight the V ‘sen=_iors"" designs andlinvited the public to attend.‘ I “The expo was something we talked about off andlon for quite some time «but she re-A ally got behind it and made it happen,” Vallancourt said. “It serves the purpose of making engineering more obvious to the rest of the community. Withouther support, I don’t know that it would have happened.” i V For students like Robert Ying, SEAS ’l6 andia Spectator editorial board member, another key initiative Boyce led was r the creation of the Makerspace, 650 square feet of open lab space students can access to pursue independent research and projects. V “It’s very hard to make a value judgement that says, ‘ls it worth losing a classroom in exchange for having another open lab for students?’ But she made that value judgment, and I think it’s the right one,” Ying said. _“I haven’t seen the classr room crunch getting worse, and in exchange we have a space A that’s open on students’ sched- . ule. It’s had pretty much constant usage.” V . Ying also cited the Extreme ' Engineering series as an exV ample of Boyce’s work to bring engineering to the forefront of the university. The lecture _ series, which kicked off this September,.has brought NASA s engineers and arctic explorers to campus with the goal of exposing students to exciting and radical jobs irrengineering. »“It ‘Wasn’t just. engineering students——peopleicame because it was cool,” Ying said. “That’s the kind of thing that - excites people and I think that has helped, because engineering has often been forgotten on campus,” E T ‘ Professor of. profession- ' al practice in the mechanical engineering department and former astronaut. Mike Massimino, who has helped to lead Extreme Engineering, said that Boyce’s vision for the series mirrors her passion for engineering and ‘her larger vision for the school. a E “I think she has thisvision "" that engineering is supposed ‘ to be fun, it's supposed to be exciting,” ‘Massimino said. (“You probably didn't become . an engineer becausé""‘yoil'want to solve differential equations.

90,Global Core,The dual-core of liberal arts and technology,5 November 2015,"- : . BY'ERIC Ho What’s the hottest craze in education policy and reform today? Coding. Consider New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s efforts toexpand computer science education in New York public schools. Despite the shortageiof teachers certified to A teach computer science, de Blasio hopes that computer science will be offered in all New York public schools within 10 years. ""De Blasio’s initiative is just one of many initiatives across “the country to enhance computer science education. Computer science education; is the next big trend in educational policy, partly fueled by worries over U.S. performance on international exams and a changing job market that values STEM degrees more than before. Even Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and President Barack Obama have joined the computer science hype train in calling for more coding in classrooms. It makes sense, then, that technology should become a great- » er part: of the foundational education at Columbia, at least to reflect this new paradigmin education. Ifelementary and secondary education policymakers recognize technology as pivotal in general education, surely the Core should incorporate technology as well. A technology component would also be a boon to those students whose schools (like mine) did not offer any sort of computer science education (in the same way"" that the Core offered me the liberal arts education I sorely lacked in high school). j . f . The implementation, however, would be trickier. How ex- ’ actly would technology fit into the Core? And what exactly is’ i this technology to be taught? ’ Y A. V _ ' For the first question, a course similar to “Computing in Context” would fitwell Within the traditional liberal arts focus of the Core. While humanities majors would be able to gain a rudimentary understanding of coding, STEM'majors could learn about broader applications of their fields, and‘ hopefully see less of a divide between their field and the _hu_manities-oriented ones. Frontiers of Science could step outside of its traditional natural sciences focus to offer a section oncomputing—perhaps a broad look at new technological innovations. and frontiers like quantum computing. More University Writing sections like this one on engineering and data science -would enable students to both read about technology, sifting through the jargon, and also ' write about it. There are many ways that technology education can be smoothly integrated into the Core without sacrificing the Core’s historic liberal arts focus. » Y i ‘ Nevertheless, some people are wary of this newfound obsession with coding. Just because it’s the next cool (and profitable) thing doesn’t necessarily warrant its inclusion in theCore. It might not evenbe strictly practical, since not everyone . will need to code in his or her future career. It’s true that the greater benefits of programming, such as‘ greater logical thinking and teamwork, are well-documented, and that these ""skills are certainly not major or career-specific. However, one might question how large a role coding should play in the Core before‘ it simply becomes another laborious requirement. Striking a balance between the principles behind coding and programming’s more intricate syntactic details would be one challenge of implementation. i , A V 4 Perhaps not everyone will programin the future, but most, if not all, will need technological literacy. ’ . “Technology”. is more than just writing lines of code. As mentioned above, an education in technology could encompass not just software (e.g. your programs, code) but also hardware. Of course, this doesn’t entail teaching students how to turn a computer on. However, there’s certainly a case for institutionalizing the teaching of technological literacy. This could span from understanding hardware specification to identifying the different parts of a computer. Perhaps not everyone will program in the future, but most, if not all, will need technological literacy to deal with computers and other forms of technology. Implementing technology into the Core may. appear as a burden to the Core’s humanities-first orientation. However, the curriculum is not static and has changed over the years to meet a changing a World, from the addition of the Global Core (which replaced Major Cultures in 2008) in response to “contemporary rnoment_of unprecedented cultural and economic integration across‘ the globe,” to the inclusion of Frontiers of Science in 2004 in response to the scientific advances of our time. . In a new iteration of changes, one way to bring the Core into the 21st century is by integrating technology. This endeavor promises not only practical and economic benefits,‘ but, also ' greater logical and creative thinking capabilities. Th'at, at least,’ * is in keeping With’ the fundamental goal of the Core—to “cultivate a critical and creative intellectual capacity.” _ lEr.ic H0 is a Columbia College junior majoring in computer science and statistics, with a special concentration in educational studies. ."
