0,College Sets Limit on Incompletes,2 December 1975,"By LOUIS ANTONELLICollege students with two or more incompletes will be ineligible for further incompletes, Dean of Students Henry Coleman announced last week. Coleman also decided, in an action approved by the College Committee on Academic Standing, that students will not be allowed to register in the fall if they have incompletes in College required courses, including Contemporary Civilization, English Composition, and Art, Music and Literature Humanities. Previously, students had been allowed to register in the fall with up to two incompletes, but were not limited in the number of incompletes they could take on fall or spring semester courses. Now students with two or more incompletes will be put on General Academic Warning, under which theyare not permitted any new incompletes. Explaining the decision yesterday, Coleman said, ""I have come across enough cases of where, say, a student takes two incompletes in the spring semester, then gets three in the fall, and three more in the spring. By the end of the year, that student might have eight incompletes, which is not a healthy situation. ""By that time, the student has to stay a whole bloody year to clear up the incompletes,"" he added. ""What I am saying to the students is that if you have more than two incompletes this semester, I will place you on Academic General Warning."" Coleman said the action was intended to cut the number of incompletes being taken by students, which has increased significantly in recent years. Incompletes, granted atthe instructor's discretion, are grades which indicate that work for a course will be completed by a student within a specified time, up to one year. If the work is not , completed within a year, the grade is changed to F*, a failing grade which shows that a student did not complete work on a course. Coleman said he understands that some incompletes are made necessary by illness, but added that this is usually not the case. He added that students often try to. make up their incompletes during another academic term, thus ignoring their current courses and producing a ""snowball effect."" Coleman said he felt it was wise to force students to make up incompletes in the required courses because often the make-up work involved a lengthy termpaper that could not be done during another term of active schoolwork. He added that many of the required courses are taught by preceptors, who are often difficult to keep in touch with after the term ends. Coleman, who noted that the changes had also been discussed with College Dean Peter Pouncey and Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal, said he hoped the action would keep the students ""working at the academic level"" expected by his office."
1,FORUM Is the College perpetrating intellectual fraud?,27 October 1977,"Is the College perpetrating intellectual fraud?By JIM SCHACHTERColumbia College's image of itself as a center for liberal education is intellectually fraudulent. The fellow who writes in the front of the College bulletin that ""a career in Columbia College centers on the work in general education and in the academic department of one's major"" is either a liar or a fool. The College is not a locus of humane learning because the undergraduates enrolled in it are not members of an intellectual community. A career here centers not on general or major area studies, not on anything else that is a subarea or function of the instructional facets of the university. Instead, a large portion of the College's enrollees choose to allow extra-university, extra-intellectual activities to dominate their time and interest during their stay here. And rightly so. It is fitting that students do not take an interest in their college, because their college takes no interest in them. The circle works like this: Columbia College lets its students go their own way; then the students allow the College to go its separate way; and then the College, figuring that its students don't care about it, decides that it is hopeless to try to involve students in authentic, intense learning, let alone making decisions that effect the day-to-day and long range operation of the university. What are the results of this diffusion of student interests? For the students, the result is sophistication. We forget that ""sophistication"" has a perjorative connotation. The sophisticate is one who, mainly familiar with the superficial aspects of life, exists in the realm of superficiality. Many of Columbia's undergraduates choose to attend this school because it is in New York, America's cultural center. These students get through their classes, often gaining good marks, but their major interest is in some aspect of the city's cultural life. The culture lovers can be divided into two groups. First are those interested in mastering a particular artistic skill—musicians, dancers, sculptors, actors—or in authentically understanding an art. Such individuals subsume their lives to their interest and associate with others equally engaged in gaining aesthetic ability or comprehension. That is, these primary lovers of culture participate in an intellectual community centered on their interest, no doubt finding members of that community both within the university and without. The second group of culture lovers is composed of those who merely admire the arts, that is, the sophisticates. When a new ballet company comes to town, they're off to watch it. A new Italian movie? Seeing it soon after its release is a must. The sophisticate is obligated to be current in his area of sophistication. He must know what operas are on the Met's calendar for the next year, and it doesn't hurt to be familiar with the backstage bickering that resulted in that calendar. These are thethings the sophisticate thinks about and discusses. He is truly fascinated by such details and believes he is an expert of sorts. ""Yet how different is it to be an expert in the comings and goings of dramas than in the comings and goings of Jackie Onassis? And where is the greater show of profundity in knowing what movies ought to be ""important"" next fall rather than knowing what shoes will be in style at Christmas-time. We condemn the person who worries about celebrities as a gossip, and call the fashion-plate vain. Both are guilty of superficiality. And so, clearly enough, is that second kind of culture lover found around Columbia, the sophisticate. And just as he who is concerned about celebrities when he is eighteen is concerned about celebrities when he is thirty-six, so the sophisticated college student will be the sophisticated young and middle-aged adult. I assert that, in great measure, the people Columbia College is turning out arewhat the sophisticated media refer to as ""the Beautiful People."" Their jobs are ""right""; their clothes are ""right""; their friends are ""right""; their interests are ""right."" And they are hulks hopelessly awash in a sea of superficiality. Columbia is entwined in a web of sophistication. The political sophisticates, for example, place posters around campus to announce meetings in support of every nationalist movement imaginable. The members of Ethiopian and Chilean and Zionist solidarity groups all primarily exhibit a superficial and selfish understanding of the world. Consumed with the defense of one nationality's interests, usually their own, they are as egocentric as the Beautiful People, except that they are concerned with the self-importance of one national among all the nations rather than that of one person among humanity. How is Columbia College to blame for the fact that is producing superficial, selfish sophisticates?It is at fault because it does not demand its students' attention. It does not care whether the young men with whose liberal education it is entrusted ever gain the curiosity, knowledge, and judgment an education should imspire and provide. One might argue that Columbia students attend those unique Contemporary Civilization and Humanities classes which are designed to broaden minds and force and force young people to form defensible opinions. As far as this picture is reality, C.C. and Hum are the best things the College has to offer. However, as anyone who has sat in a required general education class knows, C. C. and Hum. are not necessarily dynamic intellectual experiences. Reading is not done. A few people, not always the best informed, dominate discussion. The essentials of each text may not be touched on. Too many of the students, then, do not care about the classes. Why don't they care? They don't carebecause the College has told them it doesn't care whether the students learn anything in the socalled ""core"" courses. Inane discussion is tolerated. Nonreading is not questioned. Mediocre papers receive above average marks. And, let's face it: just about everyone gets a good grade at the end of the term.* The general education classroom is not an intellectual community; rather it is the bedchamber of mediocrity. And the administrators and faculty of Columbia College are to blame for the mediocrity. They set the standards. How may Columbia's claim to being a bastion of liberal education be made valid? First, more must be expected of the student in the classroom. If a student is to get a good grade, he must learn. If he is to master the subject area of a general education course, he must read the books upon which the class discussions and written work are based. Teachers must be set free to force compliance with these learning rules; they must be allowed and even told to give spot quizzes that check for reading and comprehension, to weight marks heavily on the basis of intelligent participation in daily discussion, to be sure a paper is of high quality before it is given a good mark. (I do not suggest that good grades should be the final cause of learning. However, in the transistional period preceding the establishment of an intellectual community in the College, the use of grades to evaluate quality of learning might motivate students to dedicate themselves to their work.) If this commitment to deeper understanding of the great ideas of all times makes it impossible to read all the books presently covered, let the reading lists be cut. We cannot understand everything; we ought to understand something. Second, the university must develop a program which allows students to meet and converse intelligently with each other and with representatives of the faculty and administration on a regular, informal, but required basis. A setting wherein six or seven students are invited to a professor's apartment for a homecooked meal (paid for by the university) could well be an opportunity for the students and instructor to enlighten each other. The important issues of the moment could be discussed more fully than a class setting allows. The university recognizes the value of such discussions. Among the better kept secrets of the College is its John Jay National Scholars program, which honors the top one per cent of the freshman class. Its main selling point is a monthly dinner attended by the ten or twelve scholars, and an administrator or two, a faculty member, and a celebrated person from the New York area. Whyshould such an opportunity for mind-broadening be limited to an elite of the College? Am I advocating a return to paternalism? Not really. Intensified core courses and dinnerdiscussions with professors in attendance would not have the effect of making students accept a body of opinions handed down the the Benevolent Fathers of the College. Rather, such profound learning activities would more likely be cells of enlightenment. The better informed and wiser a man becomes today, the better able he is to see the faults in the make-up of the world, and the more likely he is to take action to improve humanity. This campus, like many others, exploded in violent rejection of the ways of the world in tin the late 1960s because groups of serious students met to study and discuss issues of worldwide significance in an historical context. And if those students had cooperated with their teachers, if the two groups hadbeen co-learners, the 60s movement might have had a firmer intellectual and practical basis. In France, where the agitators of the 60' s were a coalition of students and teachers and workers, the Left now has the chance to take control of the government. Neither am I proposing the nurture of ascetic eggheads. Again, the person of learning is bound to appreciate the complexities of the work, haveheightened passions, and care deeply about many facets of culture. He'll be interested in theatre, music, sport, dance, humor, realizing that to understand the harmious and conflicting relationships of these is to understand a large part of humanity. The intellectual will enjoy, intellectually. With the adoption of these"
2,Humanities Fellows offered a post-doctoral breather,30 November 1977,"By MAGGIE ELLIOTTIt used to be that if you'd finished your doctorate, you had two choices: apply for a research grant and hole yourself up in the library, or join the ranks of the overworked junior professors. For a small number of post-doctoral scholars there is now another way; Columbia's Society of Fellows in the Humanities offers an oppurtunity for recent Ph.D.'s toengage in subsidized research and interdisciplinary teaching. ""It's a great oppurtunity to help people interested in diversifying into interdisciplinary work,"" said Judith Johnston, a second year fellow. ""It is serving me very well. I like teaching Humanities. It's a good course to teach. It seems to be a useful thing to have time to do research and publish,"" said Richard McCoy, a first year fellow. Both Johnston and McCoy are members of the first group of 12 presently working at Columbia. The Society was founded in 1976 with endowments from the Andrew Mellon Foundation and the Kenan Trust. In the first year of the two year program the fellows are expected to teach one section of the Columbia Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization while developing an experimental, innovative interdisciplinary course to be taught in the second year, possibly in collaboration with a senior faculty member. All the fellows interviewed commented on the advantages of having a breathing space in which to re-examine their discipline in light of what people in other disciplines have been doing. Judith Johnston, whose course onthe literary and historal views of war in the United States, found that her discussions with David Macy, another fellow whose field is history were very useful in helping her to define what area of historical material would be compatible with the aims of her course. ""(They) encourage us not to be parochial, to return our language to a level which can be understood by humanity,"" said Myron Magnet, a first year fellow in English. But the program is young, and is not without its difficulties. The major area of complaint was the narrowness of the focus among its participants. Eight of the twelve present fellows are language or literature-oriented, and the discussions held at the society are found to be very limited. McCoy asserted that Interdisciplinary studies are an intriguing theory, but it is neccessary to have a common ground from which to start.When questioned about the narrowness of focus Professor Steven Marcus, George Delacorte Professor in the humanities and cochairman of the Governing Board of the society, said he was embarassed by the lack of scope in the present fellows but that theyw ere the best qualified. He said he hopes a wider range of disciplines will be represented in future years. Another frequent complaint was the inaccessibility of the senior staff members whose assistance has been sought in the development of the second year experimental courses. ""We are such a new organization that I have to preface any requests with a short speech on who I am and what the Society is"" said Johnston, explaining the problem. She also explained that many senior staff members were unwilling and hesitant about committing themselves to large amounts of time with the fellows. The second year fellows have an added problem. The first sixfellows were chosen from among the Columbia community and therefore are familiar with the people on campus. The second six fellows were chosen by national competition, most of them coming from outside. Thus some of the fellows are finding it difficult even locating the right people to talk to. The Society recently got some good news. It was assured space in a center for the humanities in the new East Campus Dormitory thanks to a $700,000 gift from David Heyman of the class of 1912. Even though the Society is encountering difficulties in its organizaiton, its participants are enthusiastic about its future and about what it is doing for their lives. ""What's so good about it is teaching interesting courses with interesting students and still having time to do research,"" said Magnet. ""We don't feel that our lives would be complete at this time without both."""
3,at the Olympia,20 February 1978,"Beyond and Back. Shows at 2,4,6,8, and 10. Stars no one of any import. This is a sort of semi-documentary based on the stories of what people who were pronounced clinically dead and recovered saw when their souls supposedly left their bodies. It claims that you will not fear death after seeing it— that is, if you can take an afterlife as incredibly boring as this film. In all, it is simply a dreadfully assembled bunch of loose ramblings about science, the afterlife, reincarnation, and philosophy—but you can get all that in your basic Literature Humanities class without payingthe special $3 admission price. This is yet another in the stirring line of such classics as Sasquatch, In Search of Noah's Ark, and The Legend of Bogey Creek, demonstrating once again that real life can be much moreboring than fiction. If you're really so concerned about seeing what an afterlife's like, give your money to the poor. This film has gone far ""beyond;"" hopefully it will never come back after it ends on Wednesday. Words cannot adequately describe the full inanity of this film, with its outrageous pretensions to science. When you die, you will be greeted by deceased relatives, warm light, a sort of Christ-figure, several munchkins, Frodo and Bilbo, and Rod Serling. The total effect of this cinematic effort is an existentialist one, what Sartre would describe as complete ""nothingness,"" a Kafkaesque atmosphere of suffocating futility. In other words, skip it.

4,"Faculty votes CC, Hum deadline",14 February 1979,"By RICH A RD CAMERColumbia College students must Civilization (CO and Literature Humanities courses by the end of Humanities courses by the end of their junior year, and are ""strongly encouraged"" to complete all the general College requirements by the end of the sophomore year, according to a resolution passed Monday by the Faculty of the College. The resolution, which applies to students in the class of 1981 and after and is effective immediatelyis ""not very different from what College policy is now/' said Paul Valliere, associate dean of the College. Valliere said students are currently encouraged to complete all the general requirements prior to the junior year because they are ""basic education"" courses designed to be taken ""early in the college career to build on."" He said within the last few years students, ""particularly premedical and science majors,"" have been putting these off ""until their uppercollege years."" The resolution, which passed by a majority voice vote, received criticism from a number of faculty, ""mainly from the sciences,"" according to Valliere. Many science professors argued against the resolution, according to Valliere, citing large number of pre-med and science major requirements, which would make it difficult, for students to come finish CC and Humanities early in their college careers. Valliere said the Committee on Instruction (COD studied possible pre-med and science major course programs and found no reason that the requirements could not be completed by the junior year. ""The only exception is in the case of a premedical student who is at the same time a full pre-med and a full physics major,"" he said. Valliere noted that there were few students of this type in any given class. Professor Ronald Breslow, chemistry department chairman, said it was not unreasonable to expect pre-xneds and science majors to complete CC and Humanities by the junior year. However, Breslow and Physics Professor Gerald Feinberg objected to the resolution's wording that students ""are strongly encouraged to complete the general College requirements by the end of their sophomore year."" ""For 25 per cent of our students it is impossible to complete these requirements by the sophomore year. There is no reason to criticize a student for this,"" he said. Both Breslow and Feinberg introduced amendments which would have ""had the effect of watering down the proposal,"" according to Valliere. Feinberg's amendment would have removed the phrase which ""strongly encouraged"" completion of general College requirements by the end of the sophomore year. Breslow's amendment tried to remove the word ""strongly."" Bothamendments were defeated. ""A number of people misinterpreted this as an attempt by the scientists to get away with murder.This was simply not true,"" Breslow said. Breslow said the resolution is ""relatively harmless,"" because it represents only the ""spirit of the faculty.""The resolution Was originally introduced and debated at a meeting of the College faculty last November. Debate was closed by a quorum call which produced a negative response and adjourned the meeting. The resolution passed at Monday's meeting following a short debate, according to Valliere. Valliere said the faculty had not discussed any enforcement of the new junior year requirement. ""It (the resolution) is, in effect, a directive from the COI to students and advisers. Both are asked to insure that the rules of the College curriculum are heeded. We're not necessarily worried about enforcement,"" he said."
5,The College's evolving curriculum Guidelines draw mixed response,19 April 1979,"Guidelines draw mixed responseBy FRED KATAYAMAStudent sentiment is divided over a resolution which establishes a deadline for completing College requirements by the end of the junior year. The resolution, passed in February by the Faculty of the College, calls for students in the class of 1981 and after to complete Contemporary Civilization (CO and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) by the end of the junior year, and it ""strongly encourages"" students to complete general College requirements by the end of the sophomore year. Paul Valliere, associate dean of the College, said he was not aware of any student objections to the deadline. ""The new resolution should be effected upon next year's class,"" said a freshman pre-med who asked not to be named. ""I've already planned out my schedule. I can still take the same courses, but NOW I have to take them in different order."" Tony Maratea, C'B2, also a premed, agreed. ""Forcing students to take CC or Lit Hum in their early college years will probably interfere in planning a comfortable program. In theory, I suppose it's a good idea,"" he said. Patricia Geisler, assistant dean of Columbia College and advisor topre-meds, said she voted in favor of the deadline. ""I reviewed all of the possible schedules of pre-meds and found that there is no difficulty in getting the required courses in by that time,"" she said. Both Geisler and Valliere stated that exceptions for breaking the deadline will be granted to those who experience severe hardships in fitting the required courses into their schedules. Other pre-meds who were inter-viewed supported the resolution. ""It's great because it makes you get rid of everything early,"" said Lou Brusco, C'Bl. ""That way, it won't get in my way when I take advanced science courses in my senior year. I'm all for it."" Rudy Allen, C'B2, also supported the resolution, commenting: ""In the senior year, you take tougher courses; so it's better to get rid of CC and Lit Hum earlier."" There was also no concensus among students majoring in other fields. Jim Noglia, C'Bl, an economics major, complained that the deadline would make it more difficult for a sophomore to decide upon his major. ""Taking requirements in the early years does not allow the student to take other courses that would give him a more varied background,"" he said. ""When the time comes to declare a major, people find that they haven't taken enough courses to make a decision. I'm definitely notfor the deadline."" Patrick Haughney, C'B2, a political science major, said, ""Requiring CC and Lit Hum by the junior year especially good idea for people who haven't decided on their major. This allows them maximum leeway to fulfill major requirements in their upperclassmen years."" Faculty who teach CC and Lit Hum were strongly in favor of the deadline proposal, according to Valliere because ""CC and Lit Hum are primarily courses for freshmen and sophomores."" Assistant Professor of History Peter Onuf, who teaches a CC section, said ""I understand the rationale behnd Valliere's reasoning that these courses serve as a building block for their education. But at the same time, I feel that the upperclass students have a lot to offer to the freshmen. . .1 enjoy having them (upperclassmen) in my class."" Wallace Gray, Professor ofEnglish, who teaches a Lit Hum section in which the majority are pre-meds, said he voted in favor of the deadline because ""some of the pre-med seniors that I have each year are characterized by a cultural shorthand. ""There are certain books that every student should have read by the time they reach their senior years,"" he said. ""These students would lack the knowledge in philosophy and literature that gives them a good cultural background, thus negating the whole purpose of a Columbia College education."" The optimal cut off date by which College students should finish their requirements including CC and Lit Hum is the end of the sophomore year, according to Valliere. ""Students could complete them by the end of the sophomore year, but it would be difficult for some to finish it by that deadline,"" he said. ""Rather than setting a more severe cut off time, we made it more lenient. ""I'd recommend taking CC and Lit Hum in the freshman year and taking Art Hum and Music Hum in the second year. It's just a myth that it's too tough of a reading requirement,"" he maintained.Paul Valliere . . . requirementsPOW WOW: Students above appear to be oblivious to the impending doom of exam weeß.

6,Disrobing Alma Mater,28 August 1980,"By LEONow that you're finally here, it's the appropriate moment for the process of demystification to begin. First of all, a few handy terms: GUT: Nothing to do with the gastro-intestinal tract, mainly because guts are of little interest to pre-meds, who take things like organic chemistry, by definition the antithesis of a gut. Known variously as a cinch, a mickey mouse course, a tit, etc., the gut is to be found primarily in the area of required courses. Maps for Japs, Rocks for Jocks, and Physics for Poets are examples. But the determined gut-hunter will find one in almost any field of endeavor. GRUB: Sometimes coincides with a nerd. Someone who takes no guts and can frequently be found in the so-called grub room of any campus dorm at night, when any self-respecting student is out playing pinball or drinking beer. PREPPIE: The wide use of this term to describe almost anyone who even whispers ""LaCoste"" or so much as window shops at Brooks Brothers is symptomatic of the student body's collective inferiority complex. Everyone here either wishes he were at Harvard or Yale or hates those who do.INCOMPLETE: Does not refer to the way you feel after you've failed to score at the Pub. It's what you get when you haven't completed all the required work for a course before the end of the term. Some are proud of their Inc's; indeed, they flaunt them. But it's best to avoid the dreaded Inc. unless you enjoy spending your Christmas vacation in Butler Library. DEAN: Someone who avoids you when you want to see him, and who you avoid when he wants to see you. ADVISER: His secretary signs your course-selection card. ACADEMIC PROBATION: Trouble. Guts really are necessary if you - intend to do anything significant outside of schoolwork. They're also a good way to,avoid deans, incompletes and academic probation. The earnest freshman will probably experience pangs of guilt when he signs up for his first gut, but he will soon learn that the benefits far outweigh the toll on his conscience. The best guts are those taught by eminent profs, because they are both easy and interesting. The biggies tend to teach these courses because they're too wrapped up in their research or whatever else they do to bother reading 20 page papers on the categorical imperative.The best way to find good, gutty courses is to get some experienced upperclassman to take you under his wing and show you the ropes. The most notorious guts are usually quite well-known around campus, but there is one drawback, which I call reverse peristalsis syndrome: the prof, aghast at reading his favorable review in Course Guide (""Take it. It's an easy A,"" accompanied by a 5.0 difficulty rating), decided to surprise his class (which last year had 50 and has suddenly mushroomed to 500) by doubling the requirements and adding five pages to the reading list. This is bad. Some old timers have taught guts far too long to be troubled by their reputations; they have something in common with upperclassmen who have long since stopped worrying about throwing away goodmoney learning the finer points of metal shop. Good guts include Human Development, studio art courses, film courses and the like. Don't take science courses, and unless you plan to major in the field, do not take comprehensive surveys intended as a major requirement. If you want to avoid going to class, take large lectures (make sure there are no recitations) where no one notices your absence, or courses that meet once a week. Contemporary Civilization (all the Great Works of philosophy you can cram into a semester) and Literature Humanities (Great Novels) are unavoidable, along with Music and Art Humanities. If you're lucky, you'll get a good prof. If you're not, you'll get an ignoramus TA who probably knows less about the subject matter than you do. The concept behind these courses is good (they're meant to teach basic urbanity) but the scope is too ambitious; they usually turn into a game of intellectual catch-up ball, with teachers frantically trying to lead their students through a bewildering mass of readingmaterial which must be covered on standardized exams. You usually retain enough to enable you to hold your own at West Side cocktail parties, but if you want to get laid, forget it —FIT girls are not impressed by a knowledge of Aquinas or Kant. (You'll find out what FIT is soon enough). Finally, you should know a thing or two about the mysterious workings of Columbia's administration. The university resembles the AustroHungarian Empire in organization, and some pessimists have suggested it will suffer the same fate. The big problem in the past has been an almost complete lack of coordination among the parts or any evidence of centralized planning; so the administration, in its infinite wisdom, decided to divided the academic sphere among three administrators instead of one. So now a troika of academic officers, known as provosts, is in charge; two have been chosen, for the professional schools and for the arts and sciences. The third postition, in charge of the Health Sciences (medicine, dentistry, nursing) has yet to be filled; knowing the Byzantine politics of the medical community, it should be an interesting search. Under the provosts, andresponsible to them, are the various deans of the school, including the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Law School, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, etc. Appended to the mass of 17 schools and divisions are the satellites, namely, Barnard College and Teachers College, which are affiliated but are separate corporate entities. The intellectual divisions, the departments and regional institutes, are small fiefdoms carved out by deans and chairmen and have little in common with real demarcations in scholarship. When you begin to truly understand the realities of Columbia life and you have lost, so to speak, your virginity in your sophomore year, you'll be ready to take a one-year leave of absence as scores of students have done. The best place to go is Reid Hall, Columbia's one-or two-semester French program in Paris, where you can learn the language, do away with your requirement, and become the quintessentially well-rounded Columbia man or woman. A leave of absence gives you the much-needed breath of fresh air; it's best to do nothing if you've been doing something at school, or to do something if you've been doing nothing. When you return, one of two states of mind will greet you; you'll have a completely new, fresh perspective and plunge into academic life once again with vigor, or you'll spend your first month with ruminations of ""Oh my God! What am I doing here again!"" Bon voyage.Grubs."
7,Chaos and heat prompt fistfights during sectioning,4 September 1980,"By BEVERLY WEINTRAUBFistfights erupted among students waiting in the sweltering heat Tuesday morning to sign up for required courses when it was announced that most of the literature humanities sections were already filled. The fighting began, according to Charles Hurd, University registrar, when students who were supposed to section at 11:00 tried to push their way into the line of students scheduled to register at 10:00 in an effort to guarantee themselves a spot in a literature section. Several administrators and security guards were called in to help separate the lines which ""hadgotten all tangled up in a knot,"" said Hurd. Once the lines had been separated, the sectioning process continued smoothly, according to William Kahn, assistant to the dean of student life. Administrators were unable to explain why the literature humanities were closed so much earlier this year than in the past. David Genero, associate registrar, suggested ""there are many more students on campus at this point than there were last year at this point. Genero added he believes many more upperclassmen and students from other divisions in the university than expected signed up for the humanities courses. ""Something has happened that I was not forewarned about,"" he said. ""I'm pretty sure that we were dealing with more students than we had anticipated."" However, Genero also said enrollment in the college's required courses has increased over the last four years. The registrar's office had added mor than two dozen extra humanities sections this year to counter that trend. Hurd attributed the shortage of places in the sections to an increase in the number of transfer students. Frank Ayala, assistant director of admissions, said, however, that transfer enrollment increased by only 17 students over the last year. Rennie Childress, a sophomore who described the whole sectioning procedure as ""really violent"" blamed the confusion on the new procedure for sectioning instituted this year under which students signed up in groups based on the final three digits in their social security numbers. According to Childress, there was only one place open in each humanities section for each group of students. Therefore, all of the places were filled by the time the first 30 students in line had signed up. ""The whole procedure was confused,"" said Childress. ""The best way to get into the section you wanted was to register last week, when there were six open places in each section. The system caters to the people who can afford to come to school a week early, pay for their room, and then go and sign up. The people who can't are left out."""
8,Barnard shut out of East Campus as talks fail,17 March 1981,"By TODD BRESSIProposals to increase the trade of dorm spaces between the College and Barnard collapsed last week, shutting the East Campus Dormitory to Barnard women next year and thwarting the latest attempts to exchange freshmen rooms in Reid and Carman Halls. The College room lottery began yesterday, sealing Barnard's rejection of a proposal last week that would have reserved 105 beds in East Campus, 49 in Carman and 10 each in Hartley and Livingston for Barnard women, according to Ed Fox, chairman of the Central Undergraduate Dormitory Council. College officials also hoped earlier this year to trade some of the Carman space for beds in Reid Hall, Barnard's all-female, freshmen dorm, but the lottery appears to have imposed a deadlinefor accomodation, they said. University officials would not rule out the possibility of arranging a trade of freshman dorm space before freshmen room contracts are signed this summer. ""But as far as I can tell,"" College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka said last night, ""Barnard has rejected the idea.""Fox, the proponent of an earlier plan to swap 70 spaces between Carman and Reid, said it was Barnard Interim President Ellen Flitter who rejected the 174-bed package. ""It didn't collapse on our side,"" he said. ""It had no reason to."" Barnard housing officials wereunavailable for comment. Other efforts to increase cooperation between the schools may have stalled, too. Talks between high-level officials, concerning what Provost for the Professional Schools Peter Likins described earlier this year as ""dining halls, dorms and classes,"" are not progressing with ""the same kind of optimism"" as they had been earlier, Likins said last night. The discussions include a proposal to require Barnard students to take Masterpieces of European Literature and Philosophy (Literature Humanities) and let Barnard faculty members teach eight of the course's 28 sections, according to Carlos Carro, a member of the select College committee investigating ways of increasing coeducation at the College. Likins indicated a unified freshman composition requirement was also under discussion. The coeducation committee members were told by chairman Ronald Breslow last night talks ""had reached a low but seemed topick up momentum this week,"" Carro said. He said Futter postponed an appearance before the committee—planned for last night—until its next meeting March 30 because ""she would prefer to talk in an open and honest way on all issues she could be confronted with."" Fox said a ""slim"" hope of trading some freshmen rooms rests on whether the sides can reach a compromise when Futter meets with the committee. The only undergraduate women in Carman and East Campus next year will be engineering students, Shirley Banker, the university's associate director of residence halls, said yesterday. Women from the School of Law will live in East Campus, but they will ""be in a sense segregated,"" she said. Law students will occupy the townhouses at the base of the complex, and undergraduates will occupy the tower.Ellen Fuller . . . no slunv"
9,Cautious BC vetoes housing swap,18 March 1981,"By TODD BRESSIEfforts to increase coeducation in the dormitories collapsed last week because Barnard wants to approach the issue of cooperation as a ""whole picture"" and not in ""bits and pieces,"" Barnard Vice President for Student Affairs Barbara Schmitter said yesterday. Barnard Interim President Ellen Futter ""did not reject"" the latest proposal, which would have allotted Barnard 105 beds in East Campus, 49 in Carman and 10 more inHartley and in Livingston, Schmitter said. ""She just wasn't able to accept it at the moment,"" she explained. ""We are interested in getting everything straightened out at once, not in little pieces,"" she said. The housing trade is ""part of a bigger picture"" and Barnard must determine ""how it fits in"" with the cooperation issue, Schmitter said. She said ""the whole picture"" is being discussed by Futter, Barnard Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Olton and Columbia Provosts Peter Likins and Fritz Stern. Likins said earlier this year the ""informal"" discussions concerned ""dining halls, dorms, and classes."" Schmitter would not rule out the possibility that a trade of freshman spaces could still be arranged, but she said she does not know what Futter, Olton and the provosts are discussing.""She's very much not talking about what she's talking about with other people,"" Schmitter said. Likins said Monday night the talks with Futter had left him ""less optimistic"" about whether the College and Barnard could achieve further cooperation through the talks. According to sources, one of the topics discussed at the talks was a proposal to make Masterpieces of European Literature and Philosophy (Literature Humanities) a Barnard core requirement. Officials on the schools' Committees on Instruction, however, said they have not been asked to consider such a proposal. College Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal said he had heard only ""rumors"" of the idea, and that a proposal had not reached the COIs.He would not comment further. The Barnard COI ""tossed the idea around"" earlier this semester in a discussion of the schools' requirements, Schmitter said. Barnard students can use Literature Humanities to fulfill their distribution requirement. She said if a proposal came before the Barnard COI it ""would get a sympathetic, serious discussion,"" but she said she could not predict whether the measure would pass.SPECTATOR PHOTO OVER AND OUT GOOD BUDDY: A protestor cheers on his fellow picketers in front of Harlem Hospital last night.Peter IJkins . less optimisl'u"
10,Where are the renaissance men?,27 March 1981,"By JOHN ZIMMERMANDuring a recent mid-winter hibernation in Butler Library, I came across a curiously alluring passage in the Essays of Montaigne: ""We seem to have no other criterion of truth and reason than the type and kind of opinions and customs current in the land where we live. There we always see the perfect religion, the perfect political system, the perfect and most accomplished way of doing everything."" It was the type of quote known to incite the Lit Hum melodramatist into penning absurdities like ""Right On!"" in the margin bordering it, and I soon followed suit. The succeeding sentences proved exceedingly dull in comparison, however, causing me to temporarily forsake Montaigne in favor of The New York Times. Greeting me on the front page of the Times was this utterance of intellect: ""A strong American economy and the spirit of our free-enterprise system have a great deal to offer the poorer, lessdeveloped nations of the world. My administration will recognize that investment from our private sector, as well as our know-how, technology, and marketing assistance, is the key to African development."" Ronald Wilson Reagan, it immediately occurred to me, had just proven Montaigne's dictum. He had also just proven he had never read Montaigne's dictum. The Third World does not always salivate when the United States blows its whistle of technology—and exploitation. Sometimes it growls and bites—or takes over our embassy. But to Ronald Reagan, this is simply impossible. They must want what we want, and they must have what we have;this is America, the land of the free and the brave, and of ""the perfect and most accomplished way of doing everything,"" as Montaigne would have it. When students here label the Columbia experience ""frustrating,"" they are generally referring to the College's inept and unresponsive administration or to its woefully inadequate relationship with Barnard. These are the school's problems, and it is up to the school to correct them someday (please?). Since that afternoon in Butler, however, I have been bothered most not by Columbia's bureaucratic bungling or sorrowful social life, but rather by another irksome feature of attending this school that is totally beyond its control: everything it instructs through its greatest asset, the core curriculum, is now being .contradicted, slandered, or merely ignored by the newly elected President of the United States. On the verge of completing the required courses, I have been truly vexed to discover that the chosen leader of my nation is repudiating many of the truths we have learned. It is too easy—and, in a sense, unfair—to condemn Reagan by recalling outlandish statements he made during his governorship (e.g., ""if you've seen one redwood...""). Quotations from last year's campaign, juxtaposed with related passages from core classicists, alone suffice to show that Ronald Reagan is ridiculously behind the times, often by well over 2000 years. He needs the core curriculum—and he needs it now. On women's roles and rights: Ronald Reagan (1911- ): ""(The Equal Rights Amendment) could be used by mischievous men to destroy discrimina-tions that properly belong by law to women, respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against doing things that would be physically harmful to them. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military, and so forth."" Plato (c. 427-347 8.C.), The Republic: ""If the only difference apparent between (men and women) is that the female bears and the male begets, we shall not admit that this is a difference relevant for our purposes, but shall still maintain that our male and female Guardians ought to follow the same occupations."" On the ""enemy"" (the Soviet Union):Reagan: ""The USSR has one course and one course only. It is dedicated to the belief that it is going to take over the world. How can we trust them? They'll nail us at every corner."" John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) On Liberty: ""(Truth) is never really known, but to those who have attended equally and impartially to both sides, and endeavoured to see the reasons of both in the strongest light."" On God and the state: Reagan: ""This is a nation under God. ..America must have been created by some divine plan."" Sophocles (495-405 8.C.), Oedipus at Colonus: ""For the god they fear/Fights for our land..."" Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), The Social Contract: ""From this single fact, that a God was placed at the head of every political society, it follows that there were as many Gods as peoples."" On the energy crisis, its causes and solutions: Reagan: ""The American people haven't been doing badly in conserving energy... It is Government with its restrictions and regulations that is creating the energy crisis. We are an energy-rich nation."" Friedrich Engels (1820-1895), The Origin of Family, Private Property, and State: ""...the more capitalism advances, the more it is compelled to cover the ills it necessarily creates with the cloak of love to embellish them, or to deny their existence."" On the Vietnam War: Reagan: ""The Vietnam War was a noble cause."" Thucydides (c.460-400 8.C.). ThePeloponnesian War: ""We are going to set out against cities which are, according to my information, of considerable strength, not subjects of one another and not wanting the kind of change by which they would be glad to escape from some oppressive government and accept a new government on easier terms; very unlikely, in fact, to give up their freedom in order to be ruled by us."" Clearly, then, Ronald Reagan hasn't boned up on his core cur-riculum lately. Those of us who have are forced to sit back and gnash our teeth while our President contradicts everything we've learned in the past few years. Perhaps our only hope is that President Sovern will present Reagan an honorary Columbia degree, but with the stipulation that our nation's President actually enroll in two university courses. Yup, you guessed it. Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities."
11,Coed negotiations enter final stages 'Key meeting' set for this week,31 August 1981,"'Key meeting' set for this weekBy STUART KARLEAfter almost a year of discussions with Barnard officials about coeducation in the College, President Sovern said last week he should soon be able to make a formal proposal on the issue to the Board of Trustees. Sovern, in an interview Thursday, said the two schools were finally close to settling the issue of whether the College will admit women unilaterally or work more closely with Barnard to establish ""de facto"" coeducation. ""I want to iriake a comprehensive report to the Senate at its first meeting in September and bring the issue before the trustees at their meeting on the first Monday in October,"" Sovern said. He would not, however, say which plan was more likely to be instituted. The key meeting with Barnard President Ellen Futter will be held this week, Sovern added, at which point an agreement in principal on one of the options should be worked out. Quoted several times since his inauguration last year as saying he did not want the question of coeducation to remain unsettled beyond the summer, Sovern and other top university officials have been meeting with Futter and Barnard Dean of Faculty Charles Olton for nearly a year to negotiate a settlement of the issue. Although the question has been a focus of attention since the early '70s, debate over coeducation in the College heated up last year with the release of two reports prepared by committees composed of College faculty members and students. Both reports recommended that the College unilaterally admit women as soon as possible. Earlier this summer Sovern,who had previously refused to comment in detail on the talks with Barnard, revealed in an interview with The New York Times that the chief stumbling blocks in the negotiations concerned entirely coed dormitories and dining facilities, and the College's required Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities courses, which Columbia administrators insisted had to become required courses at Barnard under any sort of de facto coeducation system. At the same time, Sovern announced that an agreement had been reached on another key issue in the talks, the tenure grantingprocedure. Under the current system, tenure on either the Barnard or Columbia faculty is granted by a committee composed of three faculty members from the university and two from Barnard. Because of Columbia's voting majority on the tenure committees, many Barnard faculty members believe the system is weighted against granting them tenure. Sovern, however, revealed the two sides had agreed to a new committee structure that would have two representatives each from Barnard and the university and one from outside the Columbia community."
12,New CC sectioning policy leaves some empty handed,9 September 1981,"By JEFFREY YAGODDozens of students were shut out of the Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations sections they wanted because some of their classmates tried to beat the new ""blind"" sectioning procedure this week by signing up for more than one time slot, according to Roger Lehecka, dean of students. Under the new sectioning pro-cedure for the core requirements, undergraduates were to register for a specific hour instead of a particular instructor. But some students, many of them upperclassmen, signed up for several sections so that they could have a choice of instructors. By Saturday afternoon, when the sectioning period ended, there were 1200 names on the list of students wanting to take Literature Humanities, as compared with the 1000 the registrar's office had expected. Freshmen, who were the last to sign up for the required courses, had the smallest selection of openings. ""We should have anticipated this deviousness,"" Lehecka said last night. ""The registrar was certain we wouldn't run out of spaces. He was wrong."" ""We certainly learned what we did wrong,"" he said. ""It's one thing to say upperclassmen get first crack, but not three cracks."" Lehecka said, however, that many students would be able to get the sections they wanted next week. By then, most of those who signed their names more than once will have met their professors and chosen a section, he said. The blind sectioning procedure was introduced this year to discourage students from camping out overnight and sometimes fighting while waiting on line for a specific instructor."
13,Secret report attacks CC admissions Two schools have moved fast in a year to alter relationship,15 September 1981,"Two schools have moved fast in a year to alter relationshipBy TODD BRESSIWhen the informal ""talks"" between then-Barnard Interim President Ellen Futter and the university provosts were announced last October, no one predicted that within a year the schools would be close to reordering their relationship. Those ""talks"" now involve President Sovern and are openly called ""negotiations."" They have also'progressed to where Sovern could say last month that the issue of whether the College will admit women or work more closely with Barnard to establish ""de facto"" coeducation could be settled within weeks. At the start, the talks were described merely as an attempt to restore the dialogue between the schools that fell apart under the administrations of President William McGill and Barnard President Jacquelyn Mattfeld. But at the time, students, faculty members and officials in the College were beginning to push for a change in its single-sex status. The arrangement with Barnard, they said, hurt the College's social atmosphere and lowered the quality of its admissions pool. In November, the College Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid issued a document—known as the Feinbergquality of its admissions pool. In November, the College Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid a document—known as the Feinberg report, after committee chairman and Professor of Physics Gerald Feinberg—that recommended the College admit women to increase its share of talented students. The committee based its decision largely on the confidential admissions data later included in the confidential part of another faculty report on coeducation and published in Spectator today. The committee discounted any hope of attaining ""a much more integrated arrangement with Barnard than exists at present,"" because ""such integration has been under discussion for several years with no perceptable progress towards the goal."" The College faculty, by an overwhelming majority, authorized the creation last fall of a panel to explore the Feinberg report. The group, composed of faculty members, students, officials and alumni, was headed by Professor of Chemistry Ronald Breslow and began meeting last semester. In February, Provost Peter Likins said the talks concerned ""dining halls, dorms and classes."" Sources said they also concerned the tenure process and a proposal to make Literature Humanities a Barnard core requirement. The gravity of those talks became apparent when a proposal at the College level to trade dorm spaces between Carman and Reid Halls for this academic year fell through. According to Barnard Vice President for Student Affairs Barbara Schmitter, Barnard wanted to address the issue ofcooperation as a ""whole picture"" and not in ""bits and pieces."" Sovern monitored the progress of Breslow's committee and met repeatedly with him. Breslow's report, released in mid-April, reiterated the recommendation that the College admit women. ""Limited arrangements would fall far short of meeting Columbia's basic requirement for a stronger applicant pool,"" it said. Within a week of its release, the report was approved overwhelmingly by a vote of the College faculty. ' From there, Sovern emerged as the figure who would bring together the two movements toward coeducation: the one represented by the Breslow report, the other, by the high-level talks seeking greater cooperation. Sovern managed to do that in an interview with The New York Times over the summer. The College, he said, will admit women on its own unless Barnard agrees to a degree of cooperation acceptable to Columbia students. In the same interview, he revealed that the two schools had reached an agreement in principle on the tenure-granting arrangement between the schools so that Barnard and Columbia would have an equal say in making tenure appointments—a key issue in the talks up to then. The president said also that thechief stumbling blocks in the negotiations concerned entirely coeducational dorms and dining halls, and the College's required Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities courses. University officials insisted these classes had to become required courses under any sort of de facto system. By late August and early September, the negotiators ap-, peared to be closing in on an accord. Top officials from both sides indicated that several of the key issues—including tenure and core requirements—had been settled in principle. For his part, Sovern said he wanted to report on the subject to the University Senate by its Sept. 18 session and bring the issue before the Board of Trustees at its «Oct. 5.SPECTATOR/NICK ROMANENKO . . .coeducation as perceived by studentsSPECTATOR/NICK ROMANENKO . . .preserve Barnard's autonomy"
14,BC-CU talks achieve accords 'in principle' Negotiations fall behind schedule,21 September 1981,"Negotiations fall behind scheduleBy TODD BRESSIPresident Sovern confirmed on Friday that Barnard and Columbia negotiators have reached ""agreements in principle"" to widen coeducation in the dormitories and dining halls. and to make Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization required courses at Barnard. But, he told the University Senate, those agreements depend on whether the schools reach a ""comprehensive understanding"" about coeducation. ""That may not occur,"" he said. ""If it fails, we have told Barnard we will admit women."" Officials here have said they are working toward a package that would restructure the tenuregranting process and increase cooperation in the dining halls, dormitories and classrooms. Sovern said he hoped to bring some kind of proposal on coeducation to the Board of Trustees on Oct. 5 and to make a full report to the Senate at its next meeting, on Oct. 15. University negotiators had set themselves an informal Labor Daydeadline for the completion of the talks ""because of the importance of getting uncertainties resolved as soon as possible,"" Sovern said. However, the negotiations fell behind schedule early this month because ""unfortunately, (Barnard) President Ellen Futter experienced difficulties with her pregnancy,"" he explained. Futter is eight and a half months pregnant. Sovern told the Senate that an agreement requiring Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilation for Barnard students would be ""subject to the approval of the Barnard and College faculties."" Under the agreement to increase coeducation in the dormitories, students would still be able to choose single-sex accommodations, he said. Sovern did not provide any more details to the Senate. After the meeting, Sovern declined to say what a ""comprehensive understanding"" would entail. He did say, though, that the finepoints of the proposal to have Barnard students take Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization would probably be left to the faculties at both schools. It would also be left to both Barnard and Columbia to work out the details of any agreement to increase coeducation in the dormitories and dining halls, he said. There was no discussion of Barnard-Columbia relations by the full Senate. College senator Carlos Carro and Enginering senator Robert Goldberg withdrew two coeducation resolutions on the agenda. One of the resolutions asked the Senate to give whatever support it deemed necessary to the Breslow, a faculty study that urged the College to admit women. The other resolution called for a Senate convocation on Barnard-Columbia relations. Goldberg said he was withdrawing his resolution ""in light of new developments"" in the negotiations."
15,Sovern Knows What He Wants,21 September 1981,"It all sounds so sketchy. The university and Barnard are finally willing—yes, finally—to establish fully coeducational dorms and dining rooms. But they claim they are also perfectly willing to leave the details to lower-level officials at both schools. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, the centerpieces of the College curriculum, may be adopted as core requirements on both sides of Broadway—a major victory for the university. But the two faculties will handle* all the fine points. According to President Sovern, that's the way things stand now at the coeducation talks. Don't believe it. Sovern knows exactly what he wants, right down to the fine points. The negotiators at the Barnard-Columbia talks have been through almost a year of discussion. No one's going to believe these people haven't tested every hypothesis, run through every scenario, thought through every detail and carried every possibility to its logical extreme. Sorry, but it doesn't take 11 months to reach a vague agreement ""in principle"" to increase coeducation in the dorms, dining halls and classrooms. That doesn't mean that whatever Sovern finally announces will be a bad package. If it really gets Columbia and Barnard students an academic and social arrangement they can live with, it will be fine. The point is that whatever the agreement is, it will not be the result of months of faculty and student input or public discussion. Instead, it will just be a Mike Sovern announcement; a fait accompli hammered out by the president and his inner circle behind closed doors. At no time in the negotiations has Sovern made a real attempt to get input from the members of the university who should be contributing to the talks. No College deans have been asked to comment either on proposals presented to Barnard or on what ""de facto"" coeducation should be. The only information the president received from anyone outside the inner circle in Low Library was the report of the Breslow Committee. Sovern, however, has ignored the recommendation in that report to forget negotiations and just admit women to the College. Sovern is conducting these negotiations outside of public scrutiny. One could understand that approach at the initial stages in the negotiations, when the two sides were so far apart all ideas must have seemed wild and half-baked. But it doesn't make sense now, with an agreement so close. If Sovern is now working out the details, the university deserves to know the broad outline—but not so broad an outline as that given Friday. Students and faculty members deserve to know what is happening to their school. These aren't llth-hour talks in a smokefilled room with a bunch of labor bosses, Mike. This is a university."
16,Faculty disappointed by details of coed talks,22 September 1981,"By TODD BRESSIDisappointed with the tentative coeducation arrangements President Sovern outlined at the Senate meeting Friday, several university professors said they had been hoping for an accord closer to merger in several areas. Quentin Anderson, professor of English and comparative literature, said early this week that any negotiated agreement would have to be ""very close on the spectrum to amalgamation"" before he could support it. Most of the professors continued to say that they thought the best way to improve the College's declining applicant pool, a problem often ascribed to the school's lack of coeducation, would be for the College to admit women. But many said they would waituntil a final agreement is released before they decide whether to support a negotiated settlement. Sovern said Friday that Columbia and Barnard had reached ""agreements in principle"" to make the dining halls and dormitories more coeducational, and Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization required courses for Barnard students. ""It worries me if this is all there is,"" said James Mirollo, professor of English and comparative literature. As a member of (the faculty's standing committee on admissions and financial aid) I have the responsibility to be concerned about admissions,"" he said. ""I'm wondering if what satisfies students now will be sufficient to attract students in the future."" Several professors said they thought that an agreement, to be acceptable, would have to insure more cooperation in degree requirements than Sovern outlined. ""It should be more or less possible to take any course at the other school and get credit toward graduation requirements and use it for the major,"" said Gerald Feinberg, professor of physics and head of a committee that last year recommended the College admit women. Mirollo argued that the adoption of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization as core requirements at Barnard would raise only slightly the level of coeducation in classrooms and would not help attract applicants. ""If it's known you take four courses (with Barnard students) and that's all—the rest is left to chance—it will get around,"" said Mirollo. ""It may hurt."" Feinberg said he would also want to see extracurricular activities at the schools ""more or less married"" and a monitoring com-mittee set up to evaluate the success of the agreement. He also said the schools should go ""as far as possible"" towards making a single admissionsrecruiting effort and a standardized admissions policy. Peter Pouncey, associate professor of Greek and Latin and former dean of the College, said he was not sure any negotiated settlement could be sufficiently raise the level of the applicant pool. ""Twelve years of negotiations have produced nothing but fudge,"" he said. ""Clever though the president may be, he may not be the extra dimension needed."""
17,Stern tells COI of coed proposals,24 September 1981,"By TODD BRESSIProvost Fritz Stern last week told the College Committee on Instruction about the tentative accord to make Contemporary Civilization and the College's three-part Humanities series required courses for Barnard students. Stern's presentation marked the first time a university official involved with the Barnard-Columbia negotiations brought proposals from the bargaining table to the College for discussion. But the proposal has not yet been presented to the COI for formal action, according to COI chairman Michael Rosenthal. Rosenthal, who refused to give details of the discussion, said he assumed the committee would eventually be presented with a document for formal consideration but that he had ""no idea"" of when that may happen or if there was any timetable for discussion of the proposal. President Sovern told the University Senate last week that Barnard and Columbia have reached ""agreements in principle"" to require Barnard students to take ContemporaryCivilization and Humanities. Those agreements include not only Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization but also Art and Music Humanities, Provost Peter Likins said Tuesday. Sovern told the Senate, however, that the agreements would only take effect if a more ""comprehensive understanding"" could be reached with Barnard. He declined to say what a ""comprehensiveunderstanding"" would entail. Sovern said at the time that the details of the proposal would probably have to be worked out by faculty members and that the faculties of both schools would have to approve any plan. Generally, a proposal that affects the College curriculum is discussed in the COI before it is brought to the full faculty for a vote."
18,Poll: BC students want to increase CC cooperation,15 October 1981,"By VIOLANDA BOTETBarnard students overwhelmingly support increasing cooperation with the College, according to preliminary figures from a poll taken by the Barnard Undergraduate Association late last week. Of the 564 students polled, 95 percent said they favored greater cooperation with the College. Ninety-six percent favored coordinating the dining services to a greater degree and 85 percent said they wanted freshmen composition classes to be coeducational. But Nancy Poundstone, president of the student association—Undergrad—said the sampling of the school's 2,500 students was too small to trust. The poll was distributed to students as they voted for student government officers last week. Poundstone presented the figures at a closed meeting of the Undergrad representatives yesterday. Although the members voted 13-3 not to release the figures until they could be double-checked over the weekend, Poundstone confirmed the figures last night. ""We didn't want to release it because people felt it was not representative of the student body at large,"" Poundstone said. ""It didn't go in depth enough."" She said the recount could change the results by as much as 20 percent. Asked about the tentative accord being negotiated in the ColumbiaBarnard coeducation talks to adopt Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities as requirements at Barnard, 28 percent said they hoped the courses would be mandatory for all students while 72 percent said they wanted them to be optional and included among the school's distribution requirements. Eight-eight percent said women's works should be put onthe reading lists of both courses. Asked whether they ""support the autonomy of Barnard College while retaining university affiliation in the event that Columbia College wants total coeducation or merger,"" 59 percent said yes and 41 percent no. Almost 92 percent said the ""favor complete coeducation between the dormitory facilities."" But at the same time, 37 percent favored maintaing single-sex dormitories for Barnard students and 62 percent said they thought both Barnard and Columbia should offer single-sex dorms. Poundstone said she thought most students had misinterpreted the first question as asking whether they favored only an increase in the level of coeducation in the dorms. Poundstone said many of the questions were ambiguous, and she estimated the board spent half an hour preparing the questionaire before it was distributed to students. ""The poll is meant to be really informal,"" Poundstone said. ""It's an experiment in poll-taking so we know how to do it when it counts later."" Poundstone said the representatives at the meeting yesterday voted to set up a committee to review the poll results next week and possibly conduct another poll later' this year. About 15 students signed up at the meeting but the committee members have not been chosen yet, she said. Poundstone said Barnard President Ellen Futter had expressed interest in the poll results at last Tuesday's meeting with the Undergrad board. But Poundstone said she had not decided whether to send her the preliminary results this week or wait until figures could be checked."
19,"CC, Lit Hum heads clash on coed",29 October 1981,"By JEREMY FELDMANThe heads of the Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities programs disagreed at a forum last night over whether expanding those programs to include Barnard students would dilute the quality of the teaching staff. Jacob Smit, director of the Contemporary Civilization program, blasted the coeducation plan being negotiated between Columbia and Barnard—which would make CC and the Humanities classes required courses at Barnard—because such an expansion would force the schools to hire unqualified instructors. Finding qualified teachers is already difficult, Smit explained. But Paul Valliere, professor of religion and director of theLiterature Humanities program, said staffing the new sections would not be difficult and claimed the negotiated settlement was the best alternative to solve the coeducation woes of the College because it would ultimately increase the level of cooperation between the two schools. Over 80 students attended the discussion, sponsored by the Central Undergraduate Dormitory Council, in Carman Hall last night. Much of the discussion centered on the practicality of expanding the core curriculum. Smit said 26 Barnard faculty members would be needed to teach the new CC sections that would have to be offered to accommodate Barnard students. Professors in the departmentsfrom which those professors would be drawn ""will have to give up 50 percent of their courses,"" thereby dimishing Barnard's curriculum in those departments. Professor of English James Mirollo said the clause in the proposed agreement that would establish an affiliation committee to monitor the agreement thatwould have the power to make curriculum changes that would be binding on Barnard but not on Columbia would be ""humiliating to the Barnard faculty.""""I think Barnard is being sold down the river"" by the proposed committee, Mirollo said. Mirollo also said that too much emphasis ""has been put on the aspects of the agreement that emphasize the social life"" of students, adding that real issue that must be addressed is the quality of students the College is being forced to admit. ""When I look at the president's proposal, I have to ask myself 'Is this going to do it?' "" Mirollo said, referring to whether the proposed changes would improve the Collge's applicant pool. ""My view is that it is not going to do the trick,"" he aded. Columbia's admissions problems will be compounded in the future as the drop in the number of college-age students becomes more severe, he added. But Valliere disagreed, saying the agreement should be directed more at improving the quality of student life. ""We really need to worry about the quality of life in and around the Morningside Campus,"" he said, drawing applause from the students. Students repeatedly asked the panel how they could effect the negotiations and many said they wanted immediate changes in the student life on campus. However Peter Rudnytsky, assistant professor of English, said ""we have enough contact between the sexes to create an acceptable social atmosphere"" now, and student life should be de-emphasized as an issue at the coeducation talks. Although he agreed with Mirollo that the real problem to be addressed is admissions, Rudnytsky said he supported a negotiated settlement because it takes a ""longterm"" approach to the problem. ""I would like to set up a relationship of strength"" between Barnard and Columbia, he said, adding the proposal now being discussed is the first step in doing this.SPECTATOR/HIRO ABE THE POINT IS: Professor of English James Mirollo was one of the faculty members who met with students in Carman Lounge last night to discuss the coeducation agreement being negotiated with Barnard."
20,Students still camp out for classes,25 January 1982,"By MARK SEGALLWinter camping, despite administrative efforts to discourage it, is back in style at Columbia. Sixteen hearty students camped overnight Thursday evening to secure front spots on Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities sectioning lines that swelled to over 400 by 9 a.m. Friday, when the doors at Engineering Terrace opened. A new sectioning procedure, instituted last fall, attempts to shorten lines by allowing students to select time slots but not professors whose names are no longer released in advanced. Students, nevertheless, turned out in droves seeking a special time slot—or, several confessed, hoping to ""beat the system"" by discovering when certain instructors were teaching. David Genero, assistant registrar, said the students who camped out were involved in ""an exercise in futility."" Genero said he had expected some lines, which he claimed could have been avoided only through a computerized preregistration.LINK UP': The new registration system didn't eliminate lines for those who had to switch their Lit Hum or ('("" sections"
21,Grad students conduct most required courses,8 February 1982,"By BOB ASIIKHAlmost 70 percent of the College's Contemporary Civilization sections and 40 percent of its Literature Humanities classes are being taught by graduate students this semester. Attributing the large number of graduate student instructors to faculty cutbacks forced by fiscal problems, administrators said the number was too high but argued that the predominance of graduate teachers did not imply poorer academic quality. Officials acknowledged, however, that many students do believe they receive better instruction from faculty members than from graduate students. ""Would one more year of school (for a graduate student teacher) make that much difference''"" asked J.W. Smit. professor of history and director of the Contemporary Civilization program. ""It's normal at other colleges for M.A.'s to teach. People at Columbia are used toPhD's."" Smit said the most popular teachers on his staff are ""always graduate students."" adding that the large number of graduate students in the department gives the course ""vitality'' and establishes a proving ground for future scholars and professors. Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal also labled the graduate student issue ""a problem of perception."" claiming that a larger number of faculty instructors in core courses would not necessarily bolster academic quality, but would merely dispel many students' negative opinions. But several faculty members and graduate students said the problem is not purely in the students' attitudes, claiming that the broad course material in CC and Lit Hummay be too much lor some graduate students to teach well. ""You face a bigger gamble with graduate students."" said Matthew Wikander. assistant professor of English and a Lit Hum teacher. ""The immense reading load is not the ideal training ground for a graduate student."" CC instructor John Allison, a doctoral candidate in History, said the effectiveness of a graduate student as teacher ""depends a great deal on the individual instructor."" but added that ""a student of very narrow background will undoub tably have more trouble with a course as difficult to teach as CC."" Smit. however, said the graduate students who are teaching CC represent ""the cream of the crop."" Each teacher is selected on the basis of rigorous interviews and recommendations, he added. Last year. Smit said, he did not fill two instructional posftion on his staff because ""the talent just wasn't there.""' Rosenthal explained that the combined total of CC and Lit Hum classes has reached an all-time high of almost 100. while the number of assistant professors in the university has actually declined by about 90. ""This does not mean we are put-ting in teachers who are second rate."" Rosenthal cautioned. ""Only first-rate instructors teach."" Rosenthal and Smit agreed that a 50-50 split between faculty members and graduate students would be most desireable in CC. although neither said he forsaw an increase in faculty teachers soon. However Paul Valliere. assistant professor of religion and director of the Literature Humanities program, admitted the current percentage of Lit Hum graduate teachers—4o percent—was too high, placing the ideal level of graduate student instruction at ""around 21) percent.'"
22,Exam introduced to catch bad writers,12 April 1982,"By JULIUS GENACHOWSKIProfessors' complaints about poor writing skills among students have prompted the College to institute a mandatory placement exam for its Freshman Composition program. The new exam, which will be administered to incoming freshmen next fall, will attempt to discern more precisely students' writing weaknesses and to develop their strengths by placing high scorers in advanced writing courses, officials said last week. In the past, a score of four or five on the English Advanced Placement Test has exempted students from the Freshman Composition requirement. But when the new freshman test replacesthe AP exam as the standard, most students who score well will not be exempted from the program but instead will be placed in a now-optional advanced writing course. The new placement exam is part of a broad attempt by College administrators to improve students' writing skills, which, professors claim, have diminished steadily in recent years. Last fall, the College began a series of one-point optional writing workshops that complemented several social science courses. Officials interviewed recently said they were also considering adding another required three-point writing seminar for students in their junior year. ""Students' writing is lousy,"" said David Yerkes\ an assistant professor of Englishand Comparative Literature and coordinator of the Freshman Composition program. ""No doubt about it, writing has been declining the last fifteen years."" The new essay exam will last two hours and will be graded by Yerkes and several other professors, Yerkes said. He said the top five percent of the freshmen taking the test would be exempt from the requirement, the next top 15 percent would be placed in English 1011, an expository and argumentative writing class that is now optional, thenext 50 percent would be placed in the regular writing seminar English 1001, and the bottom 30 percent would be placed in English 1004, an introductory class. Yerkes estimated that under the old placement system almost a quarter of each freshman class had been exempted from the requirement. But Roger Lehecka, College dean of students, estimated that only ten percent of freshmen had been exempted. ""Clearly some people are now being placed above where they should be and some are being placed below where they should be,"" Lehecka acknowledged.Yerkes said he hoped to institute a mandatory three-point junior writing seminar in the future to stem the so-called ""lapse"" many students experience after Freshman Composition. But ""he said the university lacked the funds to begin that program this year. In the past few years, College professors have complained about the declining writing ability of students—but most have said that students' writing problems reflect a national trend rather than a weakening of the College's applicant pool. ""Students have things to say butare not setting them across,"" Robert Paxton, professor of history, said recently. ""They write as they would speak—carelessly and with no sense of structure."" ""In the long run, an apathy about language leads to an apathy about ideas and thought,"" said Paul Valliere, assistant professor of religion and director of the Literature Humanities program. Most professors said students' writing ineptitudes became more noticeable after the 1960s and early 19705, when many high school curricula shifted from traditional academic study to more experimental programs. College Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal said, however, they were also caused by a larger ""cultural pro-blem"" in the United States. ""Literacy doesn't have a high priority in the world,"" Rosenthal said. ""Students are being cheated by not being forced to write and by not having their writing seriously and effectively judged."" But other College professors said the Freshman Composition program had not helped correct these problems. ""Freshman Composition gives high faluting advice on how to write really well, when all they should concentrate on is how to write decently,"" said Jacob Smit, a professor of history. Smit added that the regular Freshman Composition course is ""meaningless"" because ""you can't learn how to write in a vacuum.""He said he would like to see the program turn into a ""counseling service"" which would work with students on papers ""for their more substantive classes"" like Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities."
23,New dean does not like idea of 'science hum' core course,15 April 1982,"By DOUGLAS HILLThe core curriculum, admissions officers boast, remains the backbone of the Columbia College education. The student probes every strand of great Western thought—philosophy, literature, art, music. . . Science. Yes, science. ""Theory and Practice of Science,"" or ""Science Hum,"" now into its second pioneering semester, was designed as a counterpart to Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Its founder, professor of biology and incoming Dean of the College Robert Pollack, said the new course attempted to provide a broad understanding of the tenets and history of scientific thought, just as Contemporary Civilization aims to teach philosophy and the humanities series tries to instill anappreciation of art. The course seeks to expose students to ""a systematic, searching examination of the premises of the scientific method, to the linguistic makeup of the sciences or to the process by which a set of observation bcomes, for a lesser or greater time, a 'fact,' "" Pollack wrote in a progress report to President Sovern, who helped finance the project with a personal donation. Pollack said that even though he believed the project was extremely important and should be expanded, he would rather not wield his influence as dean to insert the course in the core curriculum. A required ""science hum"" course could attract more students than could be taught by qualified faculty members, Pollack noted. He added that it would be difficult toask professors to take on the extra workload of teaching the course—unless they volunteered for it. ""No dean has imposed a curriculum on me, and I can't do that,"" Pollack said. He also said he feared the possibility of sections in the required course being taught by graduate students, an increasing trend in other core courses. At this point, however, the class contains only nine students, who are taught by three professors—Pollack, Jonathan Gross, professor of mathematical statistics, and Herbert Goldstein, professor of applied science and nuclear engineering. John Wielk, a College sophomore who is in the class and who majors in art history, said the ""most valuable offering"" of the course was its ""intimacy."" He admitted he was"" a proponent of the general curriculum,"" but added that any expansion of the course would threaten its intimacy.NO HUM: Soon to be Dean of the College Robert Pollack, professor of biological sciences, created the College's pioneering 'science hum' course and says he would love to see it expand. But, he warns, it would probably be ruined if it were added to the College's core requirements."
24,Ex-Lit Hum head says he left for better opportunity,15 September 1982,"By ROB ZEIGERPaul Valliere, former chairman of the literature humanities program and a longtime opponent of coeducation at the College, said in a telephone interview yesterday that he had accepted a deanship at another school because it was a good opportunity. Valliere, who left abruptly in midsummer to become dean of University College at Butler University in Indianapolis, said he had had little incentive to turn down the offer.""l did not have tenure, and I think that says a lot,"" he said. ""I think I had no long range future."" He stressed, however, that his stand on coeducation did not enter into his decision. ""My stand on that issue had nothing to do with my leaving Columbia,"" the former religion professor said. ""I was against the way Columbia went co-ed. That's water over the dam. I feel very far away from Columbia co-ed problems right now."" He added he liked Butler's core curriculum, its strong supporting foundation and its ""overwhelmingly undergrad,"" teaching-orientedatmosphere.Vailiere's replacement, James Mirollo, a professor of English and comparative literature and a leader in last year's drive to admit women, said yesterday the co-ed issue was ""the only disagreement I ever had"" with Valliere. Mirollo was appointed to the chairmanship in August. Earlier this year, another of the College's major core curriculum departments, Contemporary Civilizations, also received a newchairman. Peter Pouncey, Dean of the College from 1972 to 1976, agreed to head the department last April after almost a year of coaxing, his predecessor, professor of Germanic languages Jacob Smit, said. Smit said he left his post simply because he felt it was time for a change. ""There must not be a canon (of the way things are run at CC) that goes on into eternity,"" he said. Smit added that he will con-tinue to teach a section of CC. Both new chairmen said their departments should be ready for the increased numbers of women that will be in their classrooms next fall. Contemporary Civilizations ""will unquestionably be ready"" for coeducation, Pouncey said yesterday. He added that the CC reading list as it now stands is ""not de facto sexist"", as some critics have charged in the past. The all-malelineup of the syllabus will not necessarily change, he said. ""The question is how we address the particular texts,"" he said, adding that the course may give more attention to the roles assigned to women by such writers as Plato and Aristotle. Mirollo says he thinks his department's adaptation to women should ""come naturally,"" since Lit Hum professors examine all works for relevance before including them in a reading list. He said he also doesn't know about changing the authors whose works are used in the course, but that his department will ""take the different constituency into account.""MOVING ON UP: Peter Pouncey (left) and James Mirollo (right) will this semester take over the Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities programs, respectively.

25,New peril for neurotics: their very own handbook,28 September 1982,"By ROGER B. BLUMBERGThe Neurotic's Handbook By Charles Monagan Atheneutn, $5.95. There is no doubt that a handbook, by its very nature, can be alienating. The student of Literature Humanities may find this in Epictetus' Enchidrion, a book which seems aimed at either the Stoic or a person with an odd sense of fun. Similarly, the Renaissance ""buff"" may see the potential in Castiglione, for The Book of the Courtier is perhaps the most appreciated by those of archaic nobility or those who believe that venting sexual tension through a game of croquet is just fine. For the modern reader, the handbook aimed at a select audience can be found anywhere. Consider Pellerite's Handbook of Literature for the Flute or The Handbook of Hawaiian Fishes by Gosline and Brock, and you might well feel left out. Most recently, the handbook has aimed at the masses, but has succeeded only to a degree. Yes, there are people who cannot relate to The Preppy Handbook, nor to The J.A.P. Handbook and there are those who find The M.B.A. Handbook rather repulsive. However, Charles Monagan seems to have succeeded in his attempt to break the tie between the handbook and ""alienation,"" for he has written the handbook o/alienation. In his introduction, Monagan writes, ""The Neurotic's Handbook doesn't assume that everyone 'has' to be neurotic, but it believes that they are, anyway."" Admittedly, The Neurotic's Handbook is the type of book that is more fun to look at in someone else's room 'or apartment. You would probably pick this book up as often as you play your George Carlin or Monty Python records. Still, Monagan's handbook is very funny and even includes a ""Dead Skunk Odor Graph"" in its description of Spring for the Neurotic. The Neurotic's Handbook traces the life of a neurotic from infancy, when one learns tofeel guilty during toilet training, to old age. The private life of the neurotic is characterized by his or her writing of ""contentious comments in the margins of books."" In addition, ""Neurotics tend to take up causes that involve whales, stray cats and baby seals rather than human beings."" Particularly apropos is the discussion of neurotics who believe that ""it is their civic duty to write letters to the editor every four or five days."" Among this group is the HardLiner (""The electric chair is too good for these animals...see them squirm..."") and the language snob who writes, ""I am quite taken by your quaint but moronic use of 'from whence' in your lead editorial of Tuesday last."" For the neurotic, at least in The Neurotic's Handbook, each season brings a new peril: ""Summer is the season of sultry menace."" The description of summer includes a list of disquieting questions (""What causes the slime on pool dressing room floors?"") and a list of things not to say, like""Let's see what's under this rotten log."" ""Facts for the Neurotic"" are dispersed throughout The Neurotic's Handbook. During the ""Autumn/Fall""—neurotics feel more comfortable using both names—the fact is that ""Indian corn (the kind people nail to their front doors) is poisonous."" In the winter, the neurotic is given a list of ""Things to Avoid,"" which includes ""People who wear 'Kiss me, I'm Irish' buttons on St. Patrick's Day."" The Neurotic's Handbook even advises the neurotic on love in a section entitled ""I Can't Breathe: A Neurotic Looks for Love."" Included is a list of ""danger signals"" that tell the neurotic that ""Things Just Aren't Going to Work Out."" For instance, ""Your date holds the eating utensils like a prison inmate"" or ""Your date attempts to be clever with the waiter—and fails."" Similar signs are obvious on a dancing date when ""Your date does a modern interpretive dance to a Jerry Lewis song."" Finally, the neurotic knows that he is in over his head if he catches himself saying ""I think the scars give you character."" As the neurotic rarely goes out and, when home, is in front of the television set most of the time, a world view is inevitable. The Neurotic's Handbook explains: ""England : (quirks) 'Soccer fans who destroy railway cars.;' ""Italy: (overemphasis) 'Shoes;' Micronesia: (overemphasis) 'Fish and female breasts.' "" The Neurotic's Handbook even includes a ""Neurotic's Hall of Fame."" Among the distinguished and extinguished members are Woody Allen, Miss Havisham, Bobby Fischer and Marcel Proust, who ""spent the last seventeen years of his life in his cork-lined room at 102 Boulevard Haussman, in bed, writing."" The Neurotic's Handbook is due for publication in October, just in time for Christmas, which the neurotic begins preparing for on December 27 (although he/she waits almost a year before buying presents, on December 24 at 9 p.m. at ""a large drug store"") If you are not now in a catatonic state from laughing over the mere thought of a book like this, you pro-bably will ""pass"" on The Neurotic's Handbook. Still, it makes perfect bookstore reading and, I mean, where else can you find a Dead Skunk Odor Graph? As for me, having myself recognized myself in several parts of Monagan's book, I am quickly turning to the life-long horoscopes contained in The Neurotic's Handbook, where I read that the fate of a Cancer is ""A life of gathering useless information."" Fortunately, I am a Leo."
26,"Sectioning bribes given, students say",30 September 1982,"By JOEL BERGEmployees of the registrar's office asked at least four students earlier this month for money in exchange for placing them in special core curriculum sections or switching them into new ones, the students have charged. One of the students, a sophomore, said his Literature Humanities section was changed on the first day of classes after he paid a registrar's office worker five dollars. But associate registrar David Genero said that two reports of bribes had reached either him or the College deans and that he, College Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal and College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka ""investigated but were unable to be totally satisfied that the transactions were made inthat context."" And, the heads of the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization programs used the reports to renew calls for a new method of sectioning for the College's core courses. The sophomore, who did not wish to be identified, said that he needed to switch sections because of a scheduling conflict, but that the time slot he wanted was closed. He said the worker told him, at sectioning, ""If you do me a favor, I can do you a favor."" The student said he and the employee then bargained until they agreed upon a fee. In another case, in which a student identified to Genero two workers who asked for a three to five dollar bribe, no disciplinary action was taken against the employees because they were temporary and could not later be located, Genero said. Another sophomore said he missed his specified time to section, and when he went later he was told all Literature Humanities sections were closed. He said the registration worker told him, ""For a few bucks we could work something out."" The student said that instead of paying, he complained to an official, whom he would not name. He said that though there was an investigation, the official ""didn't get me into a section."" A third sophomore claimed he declined an offer by two employees to change his Literature Humanities section for six dollars. He said one of the workers said, ""We could get you in, but you're gonna have to pay 'cause we go through a lot of shit."" Most of the people who worked at sectioning were either students or community residents hired especially for registration during the first week of school, Genero said. James Mirollo, chairman of the Literature Humanities program,said that if the reports of bribes were true, ""it is further proof that we have to section another way."" The sectioning process for Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization and Music and Art Humanities is set up so students can only choose what time they will take the courses. There are several sections of each course taught during each time slot, and the actual section in which a student is placed is left to chance. Before the current system was set up, students would get to sectioning hours before the process started so they could get spots in classes with their favorite professors. The current system was introduced to give all students a chance at getting popular professors and to cut down on the linesstudents faced at sectioning. But Wallace Gray, a professor of English and comparative literature and one of the more popular Literature Humanities professors, said students have noticed he has taught at the same time in the same room for seven years and are able to beat the system and get into his class. Peter Pouncey, chairman of the Contemporary Civilization program, said he heard rumors circulating about bribes and that professors joked about the low monetary value of their sections. He added that the current sectioning system was unacceptable and that computers should be used to ease sectioning and give students some choice of professors. Lehecka said he had heard onestory about bribery and added, ""if it happened once or twice it will poison the whole system."" Mirollo, Pouncey and Lehecka said College officials will be meeting next week to discuss possible changes in sectioning. The committee will look into sectioning by mail and computer, among other things, they said. They added that there is disagreement as to how much information students should have about professors in advance."
27,Condensing the Word,30 September 1982,"It took God six days to create the universe. It took hundreds of years for the Bible to be written. But it took seven editors only three years to boil it all down into a 799-page volume: ""The Reader's Digest Bible""—condensed from the Revised Standard version down to 450,000 words from the original 800,000. If you're behind on your Contemporary Civilization reading, it might not be a bad book to check out —Exodus, on the CC reading list, was sliced 70 percent. Next semester you can use it in Literature Humanities —Luke is only 75 perecnt of what it used to be. The Reader's Digest would guarantee your professor would never know. John Walsh, a Digest editor, was quoted as saying the project took 20 times the effort required to condense comparable literary works. Condensing does not necessarily mean updating the language: the Biblical ""knew"" is retained, and Heaven is still ""firmament."" \ But one review of the book points ■£ out that God's instructions to Noah -^sound a bit like a hardware store how-to-do-it manual: ""You are to make an ark of gopher wood and cover it with pitch. Make it four hundred and fifty feet long, seventy-five feet wide and forty-five feet high. . ."" Already, the opposition is lined up. Jerry Falwell hit the warpath as far back as 1979, calling the plan a ""serious mistake."" He is reportedly going to editorialize against the version in a future issue of his church magazine. But you, though, don't have to worry. As long as you remember, in Lit Hum or CC, to keep your cubits, shekels, feet and dollars straight, the Reader's Digest edition of the Bible might be the one for you."
28,CC asks SEAS to drop its core requirements,4 October 1982,"By RICHARD FROEHLICHThe College has asked the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to reexamine its requirement that students take some of the the College core courses and consider instead having a general nontechnical requirement. College officials said that if the SEAS policy were not changed it would force an increase in the number of Literature Humanities sections, but they warned that the program was already nearly so large as to be unmanageable. James Mirollo, chairman of the Lit Hum program, said if plans to increase the College class size go through, the situation would get worse. There are already 50 Lit Hum sections, he said. Moreover, Michael Rosenthal, college associate dean, said he is not sure ""whetherit makes sense"" for SEAS students to be required to only take part of the core curriculum instead of any particular, ""successful non-technical"" course. Engineers must now take either Lit Hum or CC and either Music Humanities or Art Humanities, but Rosenthal said he asked the SEAS to reconsider its policy—which is three years old. Ralph Schwarz, vice dean of the SEAS, said that the school would reconsider its policy in response to the College request but that he could not promise when it would be brought up because it was reviewed so recently. He added that he understood the concern over the problems in staffing Lit Hum sections but that any SEAS decision would not be based on ""that kind of problem."" Schwarz said when the school ""recentlyreexamined"" the program requirements of freshmen and sophomores, it ""reaffirmed that the best courses were Lit Hum and CC."" He added that the requirement was changed three years ago to make sure students take a full year of CC or Lit Hum. Previously students had to take any two semesters of the six semester core curriculum series, according to Fred Post, chairman of the Engineering Student Council. That change in SEAS policy has caused particular problems with Lit Hum because a surprisingly high percentage of engineers take it instead of CC and put ""pressure on the number of sections and section size,"" according to Mirollo. Post said he did not ""see the rationale for making the core classes requirements forCollege students and not engineers."" Rosenthal answered that claim by saying the core was designed to be taken as a whole group of four classes and that the core is meant to help give direction to College students in choosing a major. But Post countered that it was ""more essential for engineers—to help them find out what they want to do""—whether to stay in the SEAS or to transfer to a liberal arts program. That, he said, is ""a more critical decision than what major"" SEAS students will pursue. Mirollo said there was validity in the argument that the core should not be taken separately. ""They are taking a piece of what is conceived as a package. But the piece does not have the total effect of the package,"" he explained.James Parker, SEAS dean of students, said that when the decision was made three years ago to expand the requirements, there was not a ""concern of taking part of the core curriculum and not the whole."" Mirollo added he ""would hate to see someone not have to take it"" but at this point he was more persuaded by the practical aspect of the pressure on the sections."
29,Some suggestions for Lit Hum,21 October 1982,"To the editor: Every year the Literature Humanities staff debates vehemently over the required reading list, with some professors advocating this or that book, according to their own personal tastes. The required texts remain essentially the same each year—lliad, Aeneid, Republic, Gargantua and Pantagruel, Gulliver's Travels—but there are usually some minor changes. I have a strong recommendation when the staff will discuss the reading list for 1983: Why not include Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye? With the College going coeducational and supposedly making adequate preparations for the transi-tion, it is absurd that among the twenty-five books forming the syllabus, not one of them was written by a female author. Are we to believe that female writers are incapable of producing great works of literature? The achievements of George Eliot and Jane Austen, I think, contradict this silly notion. How about including Pride and Prejudice to the required reading (or, at least, making it an available option)? This novel contains marvelous use of satire, irony, and narration; not to mention some basic themes emphasized in Literature Humanities—knowledge through suffering, deception of first impressions, love conquers all, human flaw of excessive pride... Jane Austen's novel is unques-tionably a ""classic,"" presenting a woman's viewpoint of English society, where we have inherited so much of our cultural richness. More important, the course has been severely criticized for its Western bias, and we should not allow it to be vulnerable to the attacks of male chauvinism. My second suggestion is to add Catcher in the Rye to the reading list. There will, of course, be formidable opposition. Some critics would hardly consider it a ""classic."" In its defense, I would like to point out that it is perhaps the most popular American novel since World War 11, especially among college students, and that it has received enormous critical praise. Others will condemn Sal-inger's book on account of its vulgar language. Is it, however, any worse than Rabelais's vivid description of human sexual and excretory functions? I think not. Literature Humanities should encourage discussions. Too often though, many students are overwhelmed with the instructor's knowledge of the books that they are intimidated to express their opinions. With Catcher in the Rye, however, the instructor may learn more from the students than the students from the instructor, since the protagonist is a young but precocious adolescent, who criticizes the hypocrisy of modern American society. Imagine the interesting and lively class discussions with this novel! In his inaugural address President Michael Sovern said: ""But it is on her common journey with modern man that Columbia finds her greatest reason for being."" In Art Humanities we study modern art, and in Music Humanities we listen to recent 20th century music, but in Literature Humanities westop somewhere in the 1860's. Literature Humanities should include a late 20th century work such as Catcher in the Rye because students should also learn to appreciate present literature. Since the course is presented in a chronological order, Salinger's novel must be the last reading, which many students will not bother to read because they are inundated with term papers and busy studying for finals. Catcher in the Rye, enjoyable and easily readable, will encourage more students to read the final book and to attend the last few discussions. Literature Humanities should make the students appreciate great works of literature, and the addition of Pride and Prejudice and Catcher in the Rye will enhance the already excellent course. I hope that the Literature Humanities staff will seriously consider these texts when it plans to make the 1983 reading list.

30,Sectioning may be done by computer next fall,4 November 1982,"By TODD BRESSINext fall, you might be able to get Wallace Gray's Literature Humanities section without waiting in line. Columbia is working on plans to computerize the sectioning process that would, as College Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal put it, ""take the physical presence out of sectioning"" and give everybody, not just earlybirds, a crack at choice sections. Rosenthal said that he thought that there was plenty of time to develop a system and get it in place for next fall and that he was ""intent"" on having such a system in place by then. But James Coney, associate controller and head of the Office of Student Information Services, which was created last spring through the merger of the Bursar's and Registrar's offices and is responsible for running registration, would give no guarantees that a program could be in place by then. ""We're only in a discussion stage, that's all. We're not at thepoint at which I can say something concrete,"" he said. The questions that remain to be answered, he said, are how the system will be designed, who will run it and what courses will have computerized sectioning. Students can get into most courses by simply signing up for them or getting a professor's or departmental representative's or dean's signature. But to take the core courses, economics and physical education students must sign up during a several-day-long sectioning session held in conjection with registration. Last year the sectioning system for core courses was reformed so that students could only pick into a certain time slot and would be assigned a section within that slot. Previously, students could pick their actual sections and instructors at sectioning. The ""blind"" system was instituted to eliminate the advantages students who sectioned first had in getting more desireable sections—sometimes students wouldwait outside sectioning overnight to assure themselves at spot at the beginning of the line. Still, students could get into a preferred time slot by arriving early and waiting in line. This fall several studens admitted they were able to bribe their ways into Literature Humanities sections. The computerization, Rosenthal explained, would be implemented to wipe out any remaining advantage to getting to sectioning early. But, he said, he was not acting out of concerns that the ""blind"" sectioning system was not working. ""For a student, what we ought to be able to offer is that the last possible moment to register should offer an equal probability of a student getting what he wants as the first possible moment—and only a computer can do that,"" said Deanof the College Robert Pollack. Rosenthal said that he hoped any computerized sectioning process would include all courses ""for which people have to wait on line,"" but added that he was most concerned about the core courses. A typical computer sectioning system could work like this: students would pick several sections and rank them in order of preference. The computer would randomly assign each student a priority number, much like the lottery number students choose for room selection, and, proceeding from the highest to lowest priority, assign each student to the section with the highest priority possible. ""You'd have to trust the Dean's office,"" explained Joe Bernstein, chairman of the College Student Council's committee on academicaffairs and College policy. That committee, acting on concerns that some students this fall were able to circumvent the blind sectioning system and work their way into sections with professors they wanted, suggested to Rosenthal over a month ago that some sort of computer sectioning process be instituted. At that point, Bernstein said, Rosenthal told them he was already working on that idea. Coney said that computerizing the sectioning system follows naturally from the university's attempts to computerize the entire registration process. As part of computerizing registration, he said, ""one of the things that was thought of was computerized sectioning.

33,The Legacy of Columbia's Santa Claus,24 January 1983,"By JULIUS GENACHOWSKIThinking back to a last-month holiday party, Marc, a nine year old Heights child, eyes sparkling and mouth widening into a toothy grin, described the party's Santa Claus with the highest accolade he knew. ""He was always hyper,"" the child said of his frequent playmate, Saint Nick. But Stephen Anestic Hermides will be hyper no more. The short, bearded (""You just want to pull at it to see if it's real""), bright-eyed friend of both young and old, rich and poor, Christian and Jew died suddenly just two days before this past Christmas. And, fittingly, he died dressed in his Santa suit in the hands of two of the Columbia students who knew and loved him. ""There is a lot of lore about Steve Hermides,"" observed Michael Neiditch, director of university public affairs. Most of the lore deals with his enthusiasm and good will. For example, the time Hermides jumped on stage to twist with Chubby Checker drawing laughs and applause from the hundreds of amused students at last year's FBH concert. ""Like clockwork,"" said Yossi Francus of the Jewish Office's Sabbath meals committee, Hermides would show up at Earl Hall Friday nights, his personal apron washed and ready, to cut the salad for that evening's meal. Hermides was overheard recently chatting with three local black men whom he had just met. Only minutes into the conversation with his new friends Hermides asked if they would let him play Santa Claus for their kids at a party. There was much more, however, to this familiar figure than the zest and warmth he offered all he encountered. Hermides was rare in the apparent extent of his complexity. He was a $100,000-plus philanthropist and a world traveler who lived in a smallsingle-room apartment without a TV, radio or phone. He was a master linguist with a good grasp of Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Punjabi, Swingali, Japanese and other languages who was asked to leave the School of General Studies because his G.P.A. was too low. He was' a Greek Orthodox Christian who could be found on any Sunday in one of two neighborhood Greek Orthodox churches but who would also attend Jewish services and sit in College Library until late in the night studying the Talmud. Above all Hermides was bizarre. Like the time he was still working in Butler Library and inspired this verbal scolding from Assistant Librarian for Personnel Frederick Duda: ""It has been reported to me that at approximately 11:30 PM on December 15, 1975 you appeared nude except for a clear plastic garbage bag in the College Library and that you resisted efforts of the guard who was attempting to remove you from the premises."" Hermides also drew fire from university officials for unusual behavior when he posed nude for aspiring sculpture Joel Levy. But the answer to the Hermides paradox may not be all that complex. In fact, it may be just the opposite, that Hermides was a deceptively simple person—one who acted, always, albeit impulsively, on what he believed was right, and not on what other people or society's strictures told him to do. It took another unique character, Ruth Apteker, a 15-year neighbor of Hermides and a non-stop talker who lives alone and calls her dog ""monster,"" to see this in the man who was Hermides. ""Stephen was one of God's naive, tremendously innocent human being,"" she said. ""He was just a great believer in the goodness of people."" Explaining his tour-de-force through College Library that night, Hermides told James Katz, editor of Columbia CollegeToday that he was simply trying to help the students who were studying for finals. ""I tried to wake them,"" Hermides said in last year's March 29 interview. He explained in a similar vein the ease with which he could be a part of both the Greek Orthodox and Jewish faiths. ""A student once said to me, 'You know what, Steve? You belong to the whole world,' "" Hermides recalled. ""I've never forgotten that. He saw in me what I couldn't see in myself. I don't belong to just one kind."" His famous beard, too, is the result of simple reasoning. In 1974, while visiting Japan, he told a reporter from the Mainichi Daily News, ""This (the beard) is for the children during Christmas."" Even his money—the sums that paid for his world travels and enabled him to create a multi-thousand dollar trust fund—can be explained simply. In his own words, ""I was just careful. I know how to use a buck."" Hermides lived in a small rent-frozen apartment, had few if any material conveniences, never married (""but came mighty close"") and didn't support any children. He lived frugally and collected an army pension, a government pension and a union pension. Even if his parents hadn't left him a few dollars, an accumulation of a couple of hundred thousand can be easily explained. • • • Born in Harbin, Manchuria on March 14, 1917 to Greek parents—possibly missionaries—who had fled from Greece to Harbin during World War I, Hermides fled with his family during the Russian Revolution, stopped briefly in Vladivostock, and ended up in Japan. Here his mother Polia won acclaim as an opera soprano, but before long, in 1923, the Hermides family left for the United States and settled in Washington Heights. Hermides graduated from GeorgeWashington High School, class of '36, went to City College to study business administration, but dropped out after just two years to collect premiums for his father's insurance company. World War II began, and in 1941 a 24-year-old Hermides was drafted, serving in a paratrooper unit. Though he saw no action, Hermides managed to become an army star, winning two ribbons and a paratrooper badge, becoming a weapons, expert, and working himself all the way up to the level of paratrooper instructor.. According to his army record, Hermides ""instructed paratroopers in the techniques of village fighting, in advantageous use of terrain, in types of buildings and techniques of entering."" He returned in 1945 to his father's business, but in 1950 the army grabbed him again, sending him this time to Fort Dix in preparation for Korea. Hermides never made it to Korea, though, and in 1952 came back to New York, now ready to move away from his father's insurance company. He found a job shellacking ladies' umbrella handles, and did all right for a couple of years, but ""when they turned to metal I lost my job."" Around this time Hermides developed an interest in the Jewish religion—he was inspired by Sephardic neighbors with Greek ancestry—and in 1953 received a certificate of excellence in Hebrew from Washington Irving Evening High School Susan Erda, counselor to the executor of Hermides' will, related a story she heard from friends of Hermides. The man next to Hermides on the assembly line at the umbrella factory w§s Jewish, and a week before Rosh Hashannah Hermides asked if he was taking off the two days for the holiday. When Hermides learned that the man had not asked for permission to take the days off, Hermides, who had made the arrangements so that he could attend Synagogue on the holiday, instead allowed the other man to go home while he stayed at work. Hermides' closeness to the Jewish religion never dimmed. He rarely missed helping with the Jewish Office's Friday mgnt dinner, and even after entertaining at the once a year Friday afternoon Yule Log ceremony, Hermides would arrive intime for the Sabbath meal in his Santa suit. At the end he also remembered his Jewish friends and left all his books and writings to the synagogue Congregation Shearith Israel and to Campus Rabbi Sheer. ""He was very much a part of our community,"" Sheer said of Hermides. He praised Hermides' knowledge of Hebrew and of the Talmud and said that ""it wasn't until after a few years that I knew him that I found out he wasn't Jewish."" From umbrellas Hermides moved on to mimeographing commercials. ""Oh so good. Yum Yum Cookies. Although it sounds simple I think it's really very sophisticated,"" Hermides said. But ""an interesting thought came to me. The more I stick around this advertising, the more I contribute to national mental delinquency."" After a brief stint at the post office, Hermides came to Columbia in 1961. He worked as a clerical assistant in Butler for the next 16 years, but Hermides was far from your typical library worker.There was, of course, his day in the spotlight in College Library (of this Hermides said laughingly, ""I walked down the whole aisle before anyone was aware of it."") And one day, after the university recalled a Santa suit it had rented him for the Christmas season, Hermides presented himself in front of the library, protesting, wearing nothing more than a sandwich board which read ""Columbia has taken away my Santa Claus suit."" For most of his career, Hermides' pranks were tolerated by the library administration. After all, who wouldn't want to have a man with Hermides' unabashed lust for life around to liven up the working day? But, said Director of the Library's technical support group James Fall, even though ""he was an industrious worker, it's fair to say that his industriousness declined with the passing of time."" In September of 1978 Hermides stopped working. There was some controversy about the terms of Hermides' departure. Soon after he left Hermides went to Spectator and the Heights and Valley News, accusing the library administration of harassment. But'He was complex mostly because he was so simple'in the end all differences were laid to rest. There certainly weren't enough ill feelings to hold Hermides back from creating his $80,000 scholarship fund. But Hermides was planning to retire anyway—""my inner voice told me to stop working."" He just couldn't bring himself to take the final step. By eliminating his job the library only finalized the retirement date, even though, said Fall, ""he may have preferred to continue working."" There remained, however, an element of irony in Hermides' gift. CCT Editor James Katz observed ""here was a person whom the Columbia Administration treated as a pariah, pictured on the front page of Spectator clinking glasses with President Sovern."" Had Hermides' Columbia life been centered around his job at the library his pressured early retirement might have been a crushing blow. But Hermides had more, lots more. He had an education to finish. From his very first day at Columbia Hermides immersed himself in the surroundingpossibilities for intellectual selfadvancement. He enrolled in 1961 in the General Studies School, but ""I was having a tough time with my subjects. My effort was A-double-A, but no results. I couldn't figure it out."" After completing the summer and fall terms with only a C average—he was admitted on the condition that he maintain a B average—Hermides was asked to leave. ""I cried like a baby,"" he told Sidney Fields of the Daily News. But Hermides was not finished yet. ""A wise and noble mother once advised me that it is beautiful to learn for the sake of learning. I've come to know my abilities and limitations. As long as I work within them, I am master of myself, and can increase my knowledge, however slowly. The day I ignore them I become an unhappy serf."" Hermides continued his education"
34,"Transfer to CC? No thanks, Barnard students say",1 February 1983,"By ELIZABETH GREENEBarnard students will probably not stampede across Broadway next semester when the College opens its doors to women transfer students. Students interviewed in BHR last week said they were generally uninterested in applying to transfer because they were happy with the education they are receiving at Barnard. Barnard students have ""the best of both worlds—the opportunities of a large university and the intimacy of Barnard, a small liberal arts college,"" according to Barnard freshman Betsy Kavaler. Students also cited specific differencesbetween the two schools, noting the College's inexperience in directly handling the concerns of women, and Barnard's women's studies department and health service. One Barnard freshman, Joyce Tsang, said Columbia is geared to the ""male mental attitude,"" citing her Literature Humanities class, where no works by female authors are read, as an example. Kavaler said her reason for not applying as a transfer to the College had nothing to do with Barnard's interest in educating women., but rather with the challenge of transferring to another school. ""I don't want to be a pioneer,"" she said.Only one of 30 students interviewed, freshman Kate Hunter, said she was considering a transfer to the College. She said her eventual major, comparative literature, is offered by the College but not Barnard. Hunter complained that there is no cooperation between the Barnard and Columbia English departments, and that the classes offered at the College are more appealing. Unlike the other students interviewed, Hunter felt that Barnard was ""too involved with education for women."" She said she thought education has little to do with differences between men and women. Other students said they did not want to gothrough the paperwork and essay writing involved in transferring to the College. James McMenamin, College director of admissions, said that in the year since the signing of the coed agreement the Coillege has received about 30 inquiries from Barnard students interested in the procedures and qualifications for admission. McMenamin said last week that because the College does review transfer applications until late April, he was unable to say how many Barnard students have applied or are expected to apply. McMenamin had previously said that Barnard students applying for transfer to theCollege would be judged on the same basis as other applicants. He said yesterday that the College will probably retain its policy of not giving credit to transfers for classes taken at their former schools in which they received a B-minus or below.He noted that the Faculty Committee on Instruction has not yet determined whether Barnard transfers would receive credit for Columbia courses where they received a B-minus or lower. Overall, the College expects transfer application for the 60 to 70openings to jump from 700 to 800. Although McMenamin said he did not expect a large number of Barnard transfer applicants, he explained that sometimes there is a ""grass is greener on the other side"" phenomenon. Women interested in transferring to the College will probably perceive ""something to be better"" in one or two key areas, he said, or will be dissatisfied with something at their home institution. Students may be attracted to the College because of its Ivy League standing or because of its diversity of students, he added. But Barnard women have ""everything Columbia women will have and much more,"" according to Christine Royer, Barnard director of admissions. Barnard students have the advantages of a strong studentfaculty ratio, more women teachers, and a medical staff that is geared to women's needs, she said. In addition, Royer said, Barnard has a strong internship program and a career services office that guides students from their freshman year to their ""last year in life."" She also said Barnard students considering to transfer should postpone their decision. ""It's always the juniors and seniors who appreciate and value what Barnard has to offer,"" she said."
35,"CC for BC at CC is OK, say Barnard students",18 February 1983,"By TOVA COHENBarnard students are taking College core curriculum courses in increasing numbers and consider them among the most valuable courses they've taken, although some found sexism in their professors and fellow students. James Mirollo, Professor of English and Comparative Literature and chairman of Literature Humanities, said yesterday that 15 Lit Hum sections have had to be added because ""there has been a steady rise over the last few years"" in the number of Barnard women. He said there are currently 300 women from Barnard and the School of Engineering and Applied Science in Lit Hum, though neither Mirollo nor the Barnard registrar's office could provide exact figures about the number of women in all of the core courses. All of the Barnard students interviewed this week recommended that every Barnard student take C.C. or Lit Hum. Debbie Farbman, a Barnard sophmore taking Lit Hum said, ""I think it's phenomenal. Everyone with a liberal arts education should take it."" ""It's like knowing the alphabet. You should know the works,"" said Megan Watt, a freshman taking Lit Hum. ""I think the core is one of thebest things the College has to offer,"" said sophomore Tracy Teicher, who is also taking Lit Hum. ""The Columbia professors are some of the best and Barnard's can't compare."" Yet Teicher said she thought her professor, whose name she did not want to mention, exhibited some sexism, pointedly questioning her and other women about why they did not participate in class discussions. ""Some teachers have a tendency to put the women down even though they have respect for them for taking these hard classes whenthey don't have to,"" she said. Sophomore Peggy Hong said she felt self-conscious at first in her Lit Hum class, which had two other women in it, but said it didnt't take her long to get used to being in ' a male dominated class."" Hong said, however, that her female teacher ""felt self-conscious about teaching girls, and the girls were noticed if they were absent or if they spoke up."" Other students said there was no sexism shown by their teachers or by the Columbia men in their classes, nor did they think the courses were adversely affected by not having women authors on the syllabus. ""It's not a matter of teaching women writers. How many female Greek writers were there then?"" asked Watt. ""There are other courses that give a better view of women writers, if that's what you want."" Yet every Barnard student complained that C.C. did not fulfill the school's distribution requirement. ""It makes me so angry. I think it's just prejudice. C.C. should at least fulfill a requirement and Lit Hum should be counted toward a major such as English or Program in the Arts,"" said Hong. And few students said they thought Barnard should force its students to take C.C. and Lit Hum, as valuable as the courses are. Julie Rosenfeld, a freshman taking CC, said she wouldn't like to take a course like Music Humanities, for example. ""I like Barnard's distribution method better,"" she said."
36,It looks like a busy week ahead for CU's Sovern Travels to Greece on a prophet motive,1 April 1983,"Travels to Greece on a prophet motiveBy AARON J. FREIWALDPresident Sovern yesterday announced he will travel to Greece next week to seek the advice of the prophet Teiresias as part of university efforts to increase the rate of return on its investment portfolio. ""I'm under a lot of pressure to make this a more profitable, non-profit institution,"" Sovern said. ""Besides, maybe the dude can give me some tips on the races."" Sovern explained that a pigeon flew into his office yesterday morning, circled three times around his desk and escaped with his corned beef sandwich. ""I think Zeus is trying to tell me something,"" he said. University administrators have said that Columbia's endowment, which is currently valued at $815 million, is not generating enough ready income. Sovern said LiteratureHumanities Professor Extraordinaire Wallace Gray sent him a copy of Homer's Odyssey, with a note reading, ""Try this."" Sovern tried it, he said, and liked it. Teiresias, a man Cadmus once described as ""respectable but a bit of a lightweight when Bacchus comes around,"" could not be reached for comment. Sovern said he has been studying the ninth book ofthe epic, trying to memorize the procedures for raising the shade of the sage, who has been dead for over 2000 years, according to sources. ""We're picking up a couple oflambs from a university ranch upstate, near Ithaca,"" Sovern explained, ""and flying on to Greece for three weeks."" Though Teiresias typically allows only hour-long interviews, Sovern said he will also be travelling to various European cities soliciting alumni gifts. Representatives from the vice president's office of government relations and community affairs have said they will join Sovern on the trip, to consult the human oracle on who to bet on for upcoming local and national political races.SPECULATOR PHOTO WHY IS THIS MAN SMILING?: He may be rich or powerful in the near future."
37,BC could lose its Lit Hum spaces,12 April 1983,"By RICHARD FROEHLICHBarnard students could be squeezed out of Literature Humanities classes starting next year because the College plans to increase its entering class' size without adding sections and will use a computer to force Barnard students to the end of the registration line, according to College officials. Next year, the College plans to admit 40 more than the usual 750 freshmen, though the school ""will definitely not increase the number of [humanities] sections,"" said Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the College and chair of the College Committee on Instruction. If space is tight in the class then ""the first students to lose out are the Barnard students,"" said Marc Greenough, College junior and a member of the COI. Barnard students will be forced, in any case, to take the spaces in Lit Hum which are leftover after College and SEAS students section, said Rosenthal. Although he said College and SEAS students have always had priority in getting into Lit Hum, Rosenthal said a computer will be used to do sectioning next semester—first assigning College and SEAS, then Barnard. Barnard students are not required to take a Lit Hum as are College students, while students at the School of Engineering and Applied Science must take either Lit Hum or Contemporary Civilization to graduate. James Mirollo, professor of English and director of Lit Hum said that the computer system, through which students will during the summer select a time for September's class, will allow for ""priorities"" in doing assignments. ""Columbia students ""ought to have the first crack because they need it to graduate,"" he said. Rosenthal said he thought ""it's perfectly reasonable"" to have Barnard section as space is available. Mirollo said that no more sections will be added because ""we are desperately trying to keep the virtues of a tightly coherent and integrated course,"" and with more sections that would be very difficult. ""Got to stop someplace—l think 50 sections ; sfine,"" he said. _ - ,Rosenthal agreed that an increase in sections would have a ""dileterious effect. We are not about to do it."" He said he thought the number of sections is already too large, making the faculty unwieldy and unable to interact. In the past several years, the number of Lit Hum sections has been increased from 35 to 50. The admittance of Engineering and Barnard students, who comprise 200 and 100 of Lit Hum students respectively, was the reason Mirollo cited for the increase in section. Contemporary Civilization does not have the problems Lit Hum does because fewer Barnard and Engineering students take it, Mirollo added.Rosenthal and Mirollo both said there are no plans to increase the number of students in each section past the 22-student maximum. For next year, no Barnard student will be prevented from taking Lit Hum, said Charles Olton, Barnard vice president for academic affairs and dean of the faculty. He added that the College's administration's ""guess right now is that there isn't going to be a problem."" But Rosenthal admitted that Barnard women could eventually be totally prevented from taking Lit Hum. Greenough said that because students can choose in which year they take Lit Hum it cannot be predicted if and when a problem for Barnard women mayoccur. He added that next year's larger class size might not have an immediate effect because freshmen are less likely to take Lit Hum in their first year than in their second. ""I'm sympathetic,"" about the problems the College is having, said Olton. He said however that he wants the College ""to offer a firstclass course, especially as Barnard College students will be taking it."""
38,Profs: women enhance classes,13 April 1983,"By LESLIE DREYFOUSColumbia professors agree that when the doors officially open next fall to the first coed class, the new female perspective will be more than welcome. ""While there are some areas where men's and women's interests diverge, when it comes to educa-The Coed College Getting closer every day Second in a seriestion—that's a basic area where there is no divergence,"" said Professor of History James Shenton. ""I am working on the assumption that whatever environment we see will be a much healthier one,"" he added. Professor of"" English and Comparative Literature Wallace Grey and other professors said they do not envision any dramatic changes inthe courses they teach. ""The nature of the courses I teach appeals to both the Barnard and Columbia students,"" said Gray. Assistant Professor of Religion Peter Awn did note, however, that both Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities should ""benefit tremendously"" from the addition of more women. Awn explained that ""there's no way you can seriously address the material in a single sex class."" Professor of English and Comparative Literature Carl Hovde, who has worked with the administration in planning next year's academic schedule, also said there has been an effort ""to pay a good deal of attention to the matter of adding courses in women's studies."" While few professors said they anticipate any immediate change in course material, Hovde emphasized that the case is by no means closed.He said ""it's a question of whether people think more internal changes should be made. Despite an overall support for the College's shift to coeducation, professors admitted there are some sensitive situations which will have to be dealt with. Gray said he thought that animosity could develop between Barnard and Columbia women. ""I envision some kind of bonding together perhaps, among the Columbia students,"" he said. ""But we will simply have to work to prevent it.""Professor of English and Comparative Literature Wallace Gray"
39,CC adds courses geared towards women,17 May 1983,"By RICHARD FROEHLICHSpurred by the arrival of the College women in September, courses geared toward women or based on women's scholarship will be added to the College curriculum next year and a women's perspective will be added to some existing classes, according to faculty. Two new women assistant professors of history, for example, will be offering courses in women's history, said Laurence Dickey, assistant professor of history and departmental representative. He added that professor of history Robert Moeller will also be teaching a course dealing with some aspects of women in history. Although strongly affected by the increased number of women in classes, Dickey said the courses were ""not a direct response to coeducation."" Martin Meisel, department of English and comparative literature chairman, said that a few courses taught by visiting professors next year will have a feminist angle including a course on ""Black Women Writers and their Fictions"" taught by visiting professor Henry Lewis Gates ofYale. Professors said there was no urgent need to develop new courses for women because classes already exist for General Studies and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students. But there are not many such courses, faculty admit, because there has been little work done on women's scholarship because women played a smaller role in the development of literature and history than men did. ""There is a male dominated history,"" Dickey said, though he added that he did not ""think courses are taught with a focus on male history."" James Mirollo, professor of English and comparative literature and director of the Literature Humanities program, noted that the course is based on literature until the .seventeenth century. ""Women writers are mostly people who wrote later,"" Mirollo said, so it is difficult to add them to the syllabus of that class. Joan Ferrante, professor of English and comparative literature, also conceded that therehas been very little work done on female scholarship in the past, but she pointed to recent work which is indicative of an active interest in it. She said it was necessary to ""consider what women were doing,"" adding that ""a lot of interesting stuff has been done."" Meisel agreed that there is ""interesting work being done in women studies—we ought to take advantage of it."" He added that ""coeducation has put it at the forefront of our minds."" Although most professors agreed that coeducation has provided the stimulus for most of the course revisions, they said they thought the most drastic changes will be ones of perspective which will occur in the classrooms during discussions. Meisel said that ""you don't change courses or reading. It is what goes on in the classroom that will respond"" to coeduation. ""We will try to introduce fresh perspectives"" into Lit Hum according to Mirollo who added that there will be an attempt by the staff of the course ""to raise issues that will counteract the imagesthat are not always positive"" in the discussion of women. He added that women who presently take the course ""like it very much,"" and that the faculty should pay attention to what the students in the class are interested. Peter Pouncey, director of the Contemporary Civilization program said he though ""the CC course does justice to the women s role"" but that he hoped ""that there will be enough women that they can express themselves."" There has been no specific effort by the College Committee on Instruction to encourage the development of courses for women, according to Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the College and chairman of the COL The COI did, however, form a sub-committee to investigate the topic of coeducation and the curriculum chaired by Marsha Wagner, assistant professor of East Asian studies. Among the sub-committee's reccommendations was one to establish a committee to discuss the development of a gender studies program at Columbia. The College faculty votedin favor of establishing such a commute in April. In both Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization, no new books will be added because of coeducation, following discussions by the staffs of both courses. Not all professors said they think it is necessary to change the curriculum because of admission of women to the College. For instance, in political science, Department Chairman Douglas Chalmers said that a ""women in politics course would likely be too specialized."" Chalmers said it was more important ""to add the woman's perspective and integrating it into courses than to offer new courses"" dealing with women."
40,"After 229 years, the College is ready for coed CC cleans up its act—or at least its dorms —for next year's women",17 May 1983,"CC cleans up its act—or at least its dorms —for next year's womenBy Richard FroehlichThe most popular t-shirt on campus in recent weeks has been one put out by the senior class —""Columbia College Class of 1983-100% Male."" A tradition dating back 229 years will end and a new one start when Dean of the College Robert Pollack introduces 790 men and women to the College at the Class of 1987 convocation in September. In today's commencement exercizes, Pollack will confer degrees on the last allmale class of Columbia College, the Class of '83. There will be women transfer students in the classes of '84 and '85. It is a tradition that is passing with little mourning, as students and faculty have been hardly interested in the continuation of single sex education at Columbia. Faculty, administrators and students over the last 20 years have lent their weight to the push towards coeducation. Polls showed that students were strongly behind the move and twofaculty committee reports recommended coeducation as the only way to put Columbia back into competition with other Ivy League schools. And the effects of the move can already be seen. This year, as expected by most onlookers, the College had the largest increase in the number of applicants in the Ivy League. The actual increase of over 50 percent is substantially higher than what James McMenamin, College director of admissions, originally predicted and is much larger than the next highest increase in the Ivy League—Brown's 13 percent rise. Over 5,600 students applied this year in comparison to last year's 3,650. The women who have applied, are extremely well qualified, officials say, and will comprise 44 percent of the class, higher than at most other schools during their first coed year. The overall quality of the class is much better than in previous years, the admissions office reports. But this year, preparation has been the theme as the College began a transformation that has already affected housing, medical facilities, academics, athletics and student activities. A Coeducation Planning Committee set up right after the coed decision was announced has supervised the transition so far, but its principal action was the selection of Lorna Edmundson, the former director of the School of General Studies women's center, to be special Coeducation Coordinator. The committee has been careful not to make any rigid decisions about policy, preferring to wait until the women can participate in the decision-making process, Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the college and chairman of the coeducation committee, has said. Both Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization staffs discussed the possibilty of adding works by women authors to the male-dominated syllabi, but it was decided in both cases that they should not add them. But there will be a new perspective added to the courses—considering women's roles in the works and society. Already there has been grater interest in adding courses on feminine scholarship and next year there will be more courses dealing with women. But there will be no women studies program instituted.Columbia and Barnard also took one step together to prepare for the College going coed—they formed an athletic consortium with Barnard. The athletic program will be supervised by Columbia's athletic department, which will hire the coaches for the women's and men's teams. There will be two women's teams next year, fencing and swimming, both of which will use the Lions' name. Some changes that have been suggested for a while, particularly improvements in the physical plant, have received an extra push because of coeducation. The extra sense of urgency in preparing for the first coed class has given administrators freer rein in making changes. Several professors and administrators have commented that men as well as women will benefit from most changes. Most of them should have been implemented before coeducation, they say, but now that the College is going coed, there is a general opportunity to make significant alterations, such as renovating John Jay and Carman. Both Jay and Carman will be given facelifts this summer, and female prospectives visiting Columbia were told this. Instead of being shown normal Carman suites, many women were shown resident counselor rooms to prove that the suites will be attractive in the fall. One of the immediate responses of administrators after coeducation was announced, was that Jay would have to be fixed or it would be a hinder recruitment of women. The Health Service, already squeezed for space, will have to provide more gynocolological services and will be expanding its space onto the fourth floor of Jay. Many of these changes were needed anyway but administrators feared that women would not put up with the same circumstances that men obviously have. The coeducation committee has been discussing plans for the last year and a half and has met with administrators from other schools that have gone coed recently to see what problems that they had faced, how they dealt with them and with what results. After nearly 20 years of discussions about merging aspects of Barnard and Columbia, unilateral coeducation was finally given a big push by two faculty committe reports two years ago. A report of the College Committee on Financial Aid and Admissions chaired by Professor of Physics Gerald Feinberg, suggested that the College admit women to shore up a sagging applicant pool and the quality of its student body. Another committee, chaired by Professor of Chemistry Ronald Breslow, agreed that the College should admit women, arguing that the College was no longer competitive with other Ivy League schools. And a poll carried out by the College Student Council in the 1979-1980 academic year—when today's seniors were only freshmen —showed that three quarters of the students polled favored a move to coeducation. Now, with the first coed class preparing to enter and the last all male class on its way out, officials admit there is still much to be done to prepare for the transition. The process will continue, but a historic threshold has been crossed.Columbia College's last male class: few students or faculty mourn the passing of this tradition."
41,Barnard hit hardest 127 bumped from Lit Hum,7 September 1983,"127 bumped from Lit HumBy SHARON WAXMANOne hundred twenty seven students, mostly from Barnard, were closed out of Literature Humanities sections yesterday, prompting College officials to seriously consider increasing the number of students in each class. About 10 percent of the 1,227 students who applied for Lit Hum sections could not get a space in class because more students than expected signed up for the course, according to College officials. College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka speculated that this year's flood of students might be attributed to the increased presence of women on campus. ""Women generally take more courses in the humanities and fewer courses in science and math,"" he said, adding that this has been a pattern noted at other schools that have gone coed. Lehecka said that, despite an increase by 90in this year's freshman class, the College did not add to the 50 Lit Hum sections it offers, although it did increase the number of Contemporary Civilization sections, according to chairman of the Literature Humanities program, James Mirollo. Lehecka said that the College is likely to increase the current class size of 22 per section to accomodate the overflow, rather than adding sections. In addition, Mirollo said Lit Hum spaces will open up by next week's program filing day as students drop out of ther sections. The Registrar's office did not yet have a final tally on exactly how many students from Barnard, the College and School of Engineering and Applied Science students were shut out of Lit Hum. College and engineering students were closed out—some because of the shortage of sections,but most because the computer rejected applications with clerical errors or duplications, officials said. Others were closed out because they requested only more popular sections, which filled up early, according to Mirollo. ""I figure if. they require us to take the course, the least they can do is let us take the course,"" grumbled one College student. About 25 students loitered around the Lit Hum table at yesterday's sectioning, waiting for other students to drop out of a section. Yet, College administrators said they were pleased with the new process. According to Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal, ""Basically the sectioning system worked out extraordinarily well."" The computer distributed the music and art sections smoothly and one Contemporary Civilization section was still open late yesterday afternoon, according to Lehecka. The Registrar's office said 776 of the Lit Hum applicants got their first choice of section and instructor, while 70 of 2,468 applications were rejected by the computer completely. ""With a minute number of proper adjustments we tan fix the system to eliminate the lines ""that formed when students handed in their applications and picked up their sections,"" Rosenthal said. Although Lit Hum is always the first humanities course to fill up, Lehecka commented that ""the pattern of preference for Lit Hum and CC is different from last year. It looks like it is more severe than in the past.""SECTION EIGHT: The College last week tried out a new computerized sectionion system designed to eliminate elbowing and cutting on lines and give students some say in which teacher they get. But despite the system many Barnard students were not able to get into Lit Hum sections."
42,Why they transfered to Columbia from Barnard,12 September 1983,"By SHARON WAXMANThe first students to transfer from Barnard to the College said they switched schools because they felt they belonged at the College in the first place, not because they were dissatisfied with Barnard. Of eight Barnard to College transfers, five were interviewed by Spectator this week. All five agreed that it was benefits at the College that caused them to transfer, not negative aspects of Barnard. ""I don't feel Barnard is inferior as an education, I just feel Columbia fits my wants more,"" said sophomore transfer Laura Porter. ""I was planning on Columbia when I first applied—l went to Barnard because it was with Columbia,"" she commented adding that she was disappointed when she found out the College was going to be coed the year after she would enter college. ""I felt Columbia's academic environment better suited my needs,"" said junior transfer Laura Glick. ""I liked the core curriculum, and I've taken lots of courses at Columbia,"" she said.Leslie Dreyfous, a junior transfer who is from California, said she had never heard of Barnard in high school. She sent her application to Columbia and they had to send it across the street. ""I sort of fell into Barnard,"" she said, ""When the chance arose to be at Columbia, which is where I originally wanted to be, I transferred."" ""It's more a thing of the spirit—my heart was at Columbia from the start,"" she added, ""It was not a rational decision."" Porter also said her decision to transfer was more a feeling than anything else. ""I don't have a wonderful answer when people ask why I transferred,"" she admitted, ""I really, really wanted to go to Columbia, but I can't really explain why."" Porter's father and brother are graduates of the College, and she said she wanted to share their alma mater and she also said she wants to go on the Oxford exchange pro-""It's more a thing of spirit — mv heart was at Columbia""gram, which is only possible through the College. But Porter added that she was content at Barnard, and would not have transferred to any other school but the College. ""I wasn't dying to leave Barnard,"" said sophomore transfer Melissa Mcßaney, ""I only applied to transfer because I thought it would be better for me."" Another transfer, however, was unsatisfied with the education she was getting at Barnard. ""When I applied to Barnard I thought that it was more integrated than it actually was,"" said sophomore transfer Jennifer Hochberg. ""They treat you differently at Barnard—they coddle you in a way."" Like many of the other transfers, Hochberg said she was sorrv that the Col-lege did not go coed her freshman year. She planned to transfer from the time she enrolled at Barnard and took Art Humanities and Literature Humanities last year in anticipation of the transfer. Hochberg said she was glad she had the experience at Barnard for a year, so she could get to know the university. ""At the College,"" she observed, ""things are much more bureaucratic and much more impersonal."" ""I liked Barnard, but I always wanted to go to Columbia,"" she added. Mcßaney said she disliked the tension she felt between Barnard and College students. ""There was a definite distinction between the fact that the girls are at Barnard and the boys are at Columbia,"" she said. ""There was a kind of ten-sion—almost a competitiveness."" And, she added, ""I like the attitude at Columbia better. The allwomen stuff is great, but I'd rather be in an atmosphere that's coeducational."" The students concurred that thier friends at Barnard ftaveßeen very receptive about the transfer—at least outwardly. ""To tell the truth,"" said Glick, ""it's an issue that isn't discussed all that much, and I'd rather not discuss it,"" but added that her friends have seemed unaffected by the news. Noted Mcßaney, ""All of myfriends have been perfectly receptive. I haven't encountered any hostility at all."" ""I was really nervous about it,"" said Porter, ""but my friends were really supportive. I didn't like to talk about it too much,"" she added. ""My friends asked me why (I transferred),"" said Hochberg, ""They respect my opinion. My friends are still exactly the same people."" Other transfer students are Rachel Turner, Kate Hunter, and a student who is taking a semester off, whose name the admissions office would not release.SPECTATOR/GABRIEL KUPERMINC Laura Glick"
43,CC may limit BC to Core leftovers College wants to keep classes small,13 September 1983,"College wants to keep classes smallBy SHARON WAXMANColumbia College deans are considering eliminating Barnard students from the new computerized sectioning system for humanities courses, Roger Lehecka, College dean of students, said yesteday. But before a decision is made, the deans will have to look at registration statistics to see if an excess of Barnard students caused the College to increase the size of its Literature Humanities sections from 22 to 24 students, Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the College, said. If statistics show Barnard students who registered by computer were responsible for the overcrowding, Lehecka said, a plan would be considered that would only allow College students to section by computer. Barnard students, who already receive the lowest priority on the computer list, would have to wait until all College students filing by computer were placed in sections before applying for placement. But if College students filled up all available sections* of a humanities course before Barnard students got to pick, Lehecka admitted, it is unlikely the College would expand the size of the sections just to accommodate Barnard applicants. This year the College increased the class size of each of its 50 Lit Hum sections from 22 to 24 students in order to handle an overflow of more than 127 Barnard and College students who would have otherwise been closed out of the course. Rosenthal said he though 24 students might be too many for Lit Hum or Contemporary Civilization classes. ""Would you open a class that size to include Barnard students?"" he asked. ""I'd have to think about that, and I'm not sure I'd say yes,"" he said. The computer system did not work asit should have, James Mirollo, professor of English and director of of Literature Humanities, said. Mirollo expained that College students requesting space in a section that was already filled had their applications rejected by the computer, while Barnard students who had applied by computer for a section that was still open wereplaced in the section ahead of the closed out College students. ""The idea (of a new program) is not to close Barnard students out,"" Rosenthal said. ""We want to ensure that College Students get the first crack at their requirements,"" he added. Mirollo said he doubted a new system would completely close Barnard students out of Lit Hum or C.C., the two most popular courses. ""I still don't think it is going to shut Barnard people out,"" he said, but they won't have a shot at the section they want."" For his own Lit Hum section, Mirollo added, ""I'd be willing totake in as many Barnard students as would push the class size to what we have now."" David Genero, associate registrar, defended the computer registration, saying that the number of students switching humanities sections this year was only one-quarter of the usual number. ""I had the lightest change of sectioning that I have ever had,"" Genero said. ""This indicates that a very large percentage of the students got what they wanted from computer sectioning,'' Genero added. Unlike last year'ssystem, computer sectioning allows students to request certain professors, he pointed out. Genero said most of the 127 closed-out students have been placed in Lit Hum sections, with perhaps 30 students still not assigned. ""I can't imagine it being any more"" than 30, he said. ""We have about a dozen openings"" in Lit Hum classes now, he added. A majority of the closed-out students were not necessarily from Barnard, Genero said, but the exact breakdown of College and Barnard figures won't be known until the Registrar can evaluate the sectioning statistics, hf> coi ' 4Michael RosenthalJames Mirollo"
44,CU's General Studies draws different kinds,20 February 1984,"By NAFTALI BENDAVIDSeventy to 75 percent of the students at the school who earned degrees go on to grad schools. Eighty-five percent of its pre-meds are accepted to American medical schools. These figures do not apply to the College. They apply to the School of General Studies.GS: College for Adults""People see the Columbia degree as a door-opener,"" said Ward Dennis, the school's dean, who supplied the figures. Enough people see the degree that way to make the school the university's second-largest source of unrestricted income. Many General Studies students are returning to college after having their education interrupted, and others already have degrees and are seeking further eduction. The student body includes people who are working, married, or have children, professionals wanting to change the direction of their careers, political refugees, visiting students from other colleges and many others.The School of General Studies, which offers only the B.A. and B.S. degrees, admits students under 21 only on a part-time basis. Admissions to General Studies ""is more like the graduate schools"" than the College, said Dennis. ""It's trickier. What we focus on most is the scores on the test [the SAT or the General Studies Aptitude Examination], What we're trying to do is find out if they have the English to hack it in Columbia courses."" ""Our students have a whole host of experiences which are evaluated"" other than the experiences of applicants to the College, said Sharon Scully, director of admissions of General Studies. ""I would not say it's easier to get in—it's different. We review everything case by case."" The School of General Studies emphasizes distribution requirements, rather than a core curriculum like the College, according to Dennis. For example, Bachelor's Degree candidates do not have to take Contemporary Civilization or Literature Humanities as College students do,but must take four terms of social science and philosophy courses and two terms of literature courses. The faculty of General Studies is shared with the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences ""Our students have access to close to 100 percent of the faculty of Arts and Sciences—that's not a problem at all. It's one of the strengths of this school, relative to others,"" Dennis said. General Studies students average slightly over two classes each, according to Dennis, who added that about 100 Columbia College courses have General Studies students in them. ""I have some complaints about the number of evening courses. We need more,"" Dennis added. Meetings between advisors and financial aid officers and students, and weekly lunches for administrators and students are used as channels of communication by the adminstration and its diverse student body, according to Dennis. There are also two students on the Committee on Instruction."
45,Spectator Spectrum A disappointed pioneer,16 May 1984,"A disappointed pioneerBy JENNIFER LYNCHI'm sure you have a Loathe List, a personal account of Things You Absolutely Abhor. Well, so do I, and a variety of items has lengthened it substantially since I've been at Columbia—Jay food, cockroaches, certain people. I must say, Recently, however, one item on the list has been nagging me incessantly: people who approach me, smile benignly, and coyly inquire, ""So, after your first year here, what do you think of Columbia College?"" I generally have enough self-control to walk away, but I have been known to stick out my tongue and occasionally spit at particularly obnoxjous questioners. Please understand that it's not the question's existence so much as its essence that annoys me—everyone seems so smugly assured that I'm going to complain about a few trivial matters before I reach the inevitableconclusion that, after all is said and done, it was all worthwhile anyway. Well, if you'll allow me, I'd like to eliminate a few selfsatisfied smiles. Yes, the first few days at the College were extraordinarily fun. We, THE women, were the center of attention—the administration catered to us, publicized us, and paraded us up and down the steps of Low Library. We had saved Columbia College from intellectual mediocrity, and we were marvelous. Although Barnard women had been attending Columbia classes for nearly 100 years, we were told they didn't count; the impression given me was that a woman now enrolls at Barnard only when rejected by the Col-Jennifer Lynch is a flrst-year-student In the College.lege. The administration filled our heads with the notion that we were the most academically superior students that had ever traipsed across the campus—the hottest thing since sliced bread. And then they forgot us. Sometimes I think they just didn't plan very well. Surely, though, they must have suspected that some women would demand to know why feminism wasn't covered in Contemporary Civilizations, or why all of the authors on the Literature Humanities syllabus were men. There would be more undergraduate women on campus than ever before, so why didn't they do something about the pathetic security conditions on campus instead of deferring responsibility to the unviersity? And why did the deans seem to wait until the last moment to figure out next year's housing situation. These, however, are all thingswe can change. We can tie up the deans until they institute an undergraduate walk-home service, we can kidnap Jane Mac Donald until she improves the housing system, we can get the fraternities to howl the alma mater underneath the windows of Hamilton Hall until the practically non-existent faculty advisor system approaches acceptability. But what worries me is that we won't. Coeducation hasn't been the blockbuster it was reckoned to be. When I came to Columbia, I didn't exactly expect to see a riot per day, but I still hoped to find political savvy and awareness. Because this is an ""Ivy League"" institution, I felt perfectly justified in anticipating furious philosophical debates that would spill out of the classroom and into the nearby pub, participants and enthusiasm growing en route. I assumed I would find a studentbody of little Descartes' renouncing and reshaping their previous convictions and opinions. I looked forward to impossible challenges; I expected constant questioning.l was severely disappointed. What is even more frustrating is that I don't know where to address my criticisms. No doubt the faculty and administration bear a large amount of the responsibility: office hours aside, the deans and professors are virtually inaccessible. I'm curious as to how many college students recognize Dean Pollack or Dean Lehecka when those two gentlemen stroll across the campus on Sunday afternoons. In fact, I wonder when President Sovern last strayed from the remote confines of Low Library to even set foot on the rest of the campus. The students are not blameless, either. Practically everyone is pregrad school; studying and drinkingare the leading priorities. The intellectual atmosphere that does exist is directed completely inward—every Friday night masses of egocentric students cram into the Butler grub room. They don't read the newspaper, they don't follow the presidential campaigns, but they do pore over the chemistry textbooks faithfully. Most of them keep up with the CC reading but haven't the selfconfidence to utter a word in class; those who do speak, perhaps attempting to say something original, must generally confront a small, yet irritating, group of pretentious pedantics who memorized the unabridged Cliff Notes over the summer. We must become ""students"" in the traditional sense of the word; our skepticism and inquisitiveness should extend beyond the bounds of the classroom and permeate everyaspect of our lives. We must also be more demanding—few of us expected Kaffeeklatches with Jeane Kirkpatrick, but there could be far more speakers and lecturers than there are now. And when, for Heaven's sake, will someone find a cure for this affliction of vapid, dry professors (I don't care how many papers they've published) and grade inflation plague? I believe the saying now goes, ""If you're not on the dean's list, you're nobody. I adore Columbia. The course catalog reveals the potential for an exciting and stimulating curriculum. The student body couldn't be more eclectic, and some of the faculty are simply dynamic. Occasionally, the air crackles with an electricity that can't be found anywhere else. The problem is that it doesn't crackle often or loud enough, and there are too many people who feel no shocks."
46,Coeducation is a success Women enter College community calmly,16 May 1984,"Women enter College community calmlyBy ELIZABETH SCHWARTZ and PHILIPPE ADLERSmooth. That would be the best way to describe the College's transition this year to a coeducational institution. After President Sovern had announced in January 1982, that the College would admit women into the Class of 1987, College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka said that coeducation would be a real success if it happened and no one noticed that anything was really different at the College. Although people noticed things were different, such as an incredible increase in applicants and a great deal of hoopla during the first few weeks of school, this year went according to plan without any major shocks. Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the College, predicted last fall that the first year of coeducation would go smoothly and any problems that appeared would be due to unpredictable circumstances and not a lack of planning. To prepare the College for coeducation, Arnold Collery, then dean of the College, set up the coeducation planning committee. That committee, which had been chaired by Rosenthal, gave way to two new committees this year—a faculty committee studying the question of gender studies and a student coeducation committee. Possibly the most significant problem arose from a combination of unpredictable events and a lack of forethought. In what appeared to be an admistrative foul-up, College administrators at the eleventh hour set aside 325 rooms for next year's sophomore women, effectively dictating who could live where and severely limiting the housing options available to next year's sophomore and junior men. Of the 230 students placed on the housing waiting list, 185 were men. The situtation became extremely heated in River Hall, where 50 of what students consider to be the best rooms, were originally earmarked for women. Dean of Students Roger Lehecka later wrote a letter to all students explaining the housing policies and apologizing for any problems that may have arisen in River. Another area which has caused some concern because of coeducation was the pride and joy of the College, the Core Curriculum. Several professors and numerous Barnard students for years had been voicing concern over the dearth of women writers and feminist literature in the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses. Thisyear however, the staff of Contemporary Civilization for the first time considered how women could be included in the core. Sections pertaining to women in Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics were added to the official syllabus, but no book by or about women was required for all CC classes. Professors were also encouraged to discuss the role of women in different periods studied Computerization of core course sectioning meant Barnard students had a slimmer chance of being admitted to Lit Hum because they had a lower priority than College or School of Engineering and Applied Science students. The number of sections offered remained the same, even though this year's freshman class at the College numbered 800 instead of the usual class size of 750. In addition to being larger, the Class of 1987 was labeled a wonder class because the students belonged to a much more selective group than previous College classes. Coeducation galvanized the College recruitment drive as applications increased to record levels. Applications were up 56 percent from the class of 1986 to the class of 1987, and increased another 13 percent from the class of 1987 to the class of 1988, with women's applications increasing by the same amount. This year's graduating seniors were selected from a pool of 3680 while the incoming Class of 1988 was chosen from a pool of over 6200 students. The number of male applicants to the College for next year is approximately the same level (3650) as the graduating class. To accomodate College women, the women's health center was built on the fourth floor of John Jay Hall, and was staffed by Dr. Martha Katz and newly hired nurse practitioners and peer counselors. Katz said at the time of the new center's opening that College women have made extensive use of the center since the beginning of the year. In addition, the Columbia College Women's Center opened in Ferris Booth Hall, attracting many prominent female speakers. The College's center also co-sponsored several events with Barnard's women's center Socially, coeducation proved to be a great success. Deans and students of both sexes agreed that the time had come for Columbia College as an all-male institution to end. A Columbia junior noted earlier this spring that sincecoeducation ""The social life has changed—we never saw girls around before. As far as classes go there aren't that many girls, but there's more of a change on campus than in the classroom."" Other students have noted that the campus appears to be more ""natural"" since coeducation. The concern that single sex education for men was no longer natural or preferred was one of the reasons articulated by College students desiring coeducation for many years.Carman Hall, long the freshman dungeon, was renovated last summer with new bathrooms and a generally cleaner appearance. This year the dorm proved to be a livelier place, and a more enjoyable one to live in, helped by both the renovations and coeducation. A surprise came in April, when Assistant Dean for Coeducation Lorna Edmundson resigned after only one year in office. She is leaving to become the dean of academic affairs at Marymount College, an all-women's college in Tarrytown, New York. When the College Planning Committee on Coeducation suggested the creation of the posit) n last spring, it was to last for three years. The College has yet to decide whether to name replacement for Edmundson. According to Edmundson, the two objectives of coeducation had been ""to bring women into the College as full-fledged members of the academic community and to use the transition time to consider ways in which the College can be made a better place for all."" But Edmundson also saw room for improvement. The College still has to consider including some feminist scholars into the curriculum, and ""addressing the very severe ramifications fo having so few tenured women,"" as professors. The transition to a coeducational institution has gone well according to students, faculty, and administrators but they point out that there can be no definitive opinion until there is more information than the first year's results. Nevertheless, the confident view of administrators that the College was prepared for the first year of coeducation has proved accurate.FIRST TIME UNTO THE BREACH: Columbia College allowed women through its gates for the first time ever last August 28. By all accounts, coeducation was a rousing success."
47,BC students to miss first core class,6 September 1984,"By IRENE TUCKERBarnard students seeking enrollment in Columbia core courses this year will have to wait until next week to make their schedules final as a result of a new sectioning procedure, said university Registrar Zeita-Marion Lobley. ""College and Engineering students need the course for graduation and should have first crack at it,"" said Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of the College. ""It is not part of any change in attitude toward Barnard. It's just an appropriate solution to a very real problem."" The change in procedure, which requires Barnard students to wait until Monday to section for core classes, comes a year after College officials instituted an automatic computer sectioning system that gave Barnard students lowest priority. According to Rosenthal, who organized the new procedure with Barnard Dean of Studies Vilma Bornemann, last year's all-automated sectioning did not work as planned, resulting in more than 100 College and Engineering students being closed out of Literature Humanities. To ac-comodate these students, the maximum class size for the course was expanded from 22 to 24. The scheduling of their sectioning on the third day of classes insures that most of the students involved will miss at least one class. Bornemann agreed that the solution was not ideal. ""I think in some ways we're all victims of a condensed schedule,"" she said. ""We are agreed that this is not the happiest situation, but it is the least chaoti;, mo; t efficient way of doing it. It does not answer all our needs. It is certainly not as sensitive to our students as we would like to be."" Lobley emphasized that the goal of the change was not to prevent Barnard students from enrolling in core courses. ""I don't think that the intentions of those involved were as negative as they might appear to be,"" Lobley said. ""The expectation is that there will be room for Barnard students, though we can't insure that they'll get the sections they want.""Lobley questioned the degree to which Barnard students' enrollment had been responsible for last year's close-outs. ""Ninety-six percent of the students last year got their first choice sections,"" she said. ""I don't think that Barnard students were a problem last year."" Lobley added that she had not been consulted before the decision to change the sectioning procedure was made. The number of Barnard students who wish to enroll in the courses in question isstill not certain. Last year after the automatic sectioning procedure was introduced, the number of Barnard students enrolling in Lit Hum fell by 25 students to about 90, even as the total number of students enrolld incrased. ""These seems to be a smaller interest this year (Among Barnard students) in Literature Humanities,"" Lobley said. Bornemann agreed, attributing the lessened interest to the intoroduction of Barnard's required freshman seminars this year. Rosenthal said""that increasing the number of sections was not being considered as a solution. ""The curriculum was never meant to accomodate endless numbers of students,"" he said. ""The course is bursting at the seams. When we create more sections, the staff loses its identity."" Faculty members teaching Lit Hum meet weekly to discuss the content of the course."
48,BC Lit Hum applications plummet,19 September 1984,"By IRENE TUCKERNearly all Barnard students who registered for College core classes during last week's special sectioning period were able to be accomodated, though the total number of Barnard students who applied for admission to the courses was down significantly from past years, according to Columbia Registrar Zeita-Marion Lobley. Though the 45 students who enrolled in Contemporary Civilization represented only a slight decline from last year's figures, those seeking to enroll in Literature Humanities —until this year, the more popular of the two courses—fell by 44 students to 33. In a procedure designed to help assure that College andEngineering students, who must complete the core courses for graduation, received highest priority in the sectioning process, Barnard students were forced to wait until the automatic sectioning of those high-priority students was completed. This year, Bar lard students were not allowed to register until September 10, three days after classes began. Before the registration period began, some doubt remained as to how many spaces would actually be available to Barnard students. ""We hoped that this system would allow Barnard students to enroll but we weren't really certain,"" said Lobley. ""In the end, our gut feelings were right.""Michael Rosenthal, Associate Dean of the College, attributed the decline in Barnard students' interest in its core classes to several factors. ""I assume that in part the Barnard seminar program and perhaps the notion that the courses were not worth the trouble of going through the new sectioning procedures were responsible for the drop,"" he said. This year Barnard instituted a new freshman seminar program that in part parallels the Lit Hum curriculum. The only course from which Barnard students were turned away was Art Humanities. Students from all three undergraduate divisions were closed out of the course. ""We were completely surprised by the popularity of Art Hum,"" Lobley said. Both Lobley and Rosenthal said they hoped the sectioning procedure could be modified in the future so that Barnard students would be able to complete their sectioning before the beginning of classes.HOW MUCH IS THAT DOGGIE?: What better place to be on a cool day than in a booth al the San Sennaro Festival"
49,Gray writes first book—on Lit Hum,9 October 1984,"By NAFTALI BENDAVIDStudents have waited hours in line and even bribed registration workers to take Wallace -Gray's Literature Humanities Section. Soon the popular professor's wisdom can be bought in a book of essays on works read in the course. ""This is my 20th year of teaching the course and I decided to celebrate,"" remarked Gray, who wrote his first book this past spring and summer. The professor of English and Comparative Literature was so busy writing, he added, that he had no idea ""what the weather was like this summer."" The book, titled Homer to Joyce: Essays in Literature Humanities, emphasizes the cultural and social background of each work, because, according to Gray, ""that's what's mainly missing from many humanities sections."" Gray explained that he wrote the book to provide students with an alternative analysis to that of their teachers. He said this will help them develop personal interpretations of the works, which he said he considers the most importanttoart of studying humanities. Gray emphasised that the book is not a textbook for Literature Humanities classes, and that the tradition at Columbia is to primary sources in the course. Homer to Joyce win be valuable as a ""teaching aid or help for a teacher,"" especially because so many graduatestudents teach Literature Humanities, according to Professor of Philosophy Richard Kuhns, a former chair of Literature Humanities. Gray is ""a damn good reader and a very good interpreter,"" Kuhns added. ""I don't enjoy writing academically,"" Gray said. ""This is written for students. It's not written for my colleagues at all."" Each essay is about 3,000 words long, and there is an introduction and a long bibliography, Gray explained. ""There are many such books,"" but the others are anthologies, according to Kuhns. ""The value of this book is that you have one intelligence looking overall the works."" The preface to Homer to Joyce will be written by George Delacorte Professor of English and Comparative Literature Steven Marcus, whom Gray called ""probably one of the most important people in the country as far as humanities goes—and a friend."" Gray said that the original edition will be hardbound, and that a paperback version, which will be ""much more affordable for students,"" will be published in the fall of 1985. Although Homer to Joyce is Gray's first book, he noted he has written ""the usual articles and essays."" He began teaching at the College in 1953, and remarked, ""my whole life has been Columbia—that's why I love it so much.""RIGHT BEHIND: A Reagan supporter wearing a trenchcoat at yesterday's parade looks over his shoulder to Mondale fans"
50,Larger class may strain core,10 October 1984,"By PHILIPPE ADLERAlthough the College is looking foward to the probable construction of a new dormitory on 115 th St. between Broadway and Riverside Drive, the building may bring with it the pressures of increased College size. Vice President for Arts and Sciences Donald Hood has said that the size increase, if enacted, would be less than 10 percent. This year's freshman class had 750 students. The size increase might put particular strain on the core curriculum. Currently, both Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization have 50 sections with a per-class capacity of 22 students. According to Associate Dean of the College Michael Rosenthal, while ""more tuition money [from increased College size] is a good thing,"" a ""larger college is not necessarily a good thing."" The estimated 400-bed undergraduate facility would make it easier to house transfer students, students who do not opt for housing in their first semesters, students who take semesters off, and students who get high lottery numbers—all of whom now encounter difficulties in obtaining housing. However, for the dorm to be built without substantially increasing tuition, the number of College students payingtuition would have to be increased. Rosenthal said that rather than increase the size of entering freshman classes, he would rather see less strain put on the core by ""taking more transfer students,"" who do not usually have to take all of the core courses: by ""getting a better rate of retention, from freshmen wanting to spend a full four years at the College,"" and by initiating a visiting students program. Visiting students, said Rosenthal, would be excluded from the core. While agreeing that ""from an arts and sciences point of view, they would want a greater undergraduate total enrollment,"" in lieu of a new dorm, Rosenthal said that he was committed to an idea previously enunciated by Hood, that of ""a small quality college inside a large university."" ""If you want to say that on a university level as a whole, there are people who don't care that much about the College, that's right,"" said Rosenthal. However, he stressed that ""my sense is that Columbia College is an extraordinarily caring place, and there are great attempts being made to provide a rich community spirit and a richer social life.""Richard Brilliant, professor of Art History and Archaeology and director of Contemporary Civilization, said that he was on a student-faculty subcommittee which had been organized through the College Deans' office and which will meet this Friday to discuss ""the possibilities of expanding the College and the positive and negative aspects of enlarging."" The questions raised by the Subcommittee, said Brilliant, include ""should we enlarge, by how much, what will be the impact on College life and on the core curriculum?."" Rosenthal said that he recognized that ""a new dorm would bring with it the need for a larger student body in the College"" but that he wanted ""to minimize the strain on the core"" because ""it's already bursting out andovercrowded,"" with students. Rosenthal said that he was ""absolutely adamant about not increasing the number of sections or their size."" ""The only way I'd be happy about seeing a larger College,"" he said, ""would be if we keep our educational standards high."" According to James Mirollo, professor of English and Comparative Literature and director of Literature Humanities, ""if we're talking about adding three or four more sections ""to the current complement of 49 ""that's okay."" Mirollo said his primary worry would be ""if I could keep track of the faculty. We try to have an integrated course where the faculty meets weekly to discuss and plan the classes."" Mirollo said that increasing College size and therefore perhaps the number of Lit Hum sections would hurt his department less than Brilliant's. ""If we would expand the size, there might be more younger faculty teaching, that may be part of this,"" he said. Mirollo admitted, however, thaf'it might also be possible, although we haven't done it before, to have people doubled up"" in teaching assignments. According to Brilliant, ""the question is can we staff more CC sections with first-rate instructors s f we increase class size by 10 percent?""Michael Rosenthal"
51,Spectator sports Grapplers get geared for opener at Coast Guard Russo aims to recapture Ivy title,30 November 1984,"Grapplers get geared for opener at Coast GuardRusso aims to recapture Ivy titleBy DOUGLAS A. CIFUAs we all learn in Literature Humanities, wrestling in Ancient Greece was a highly individual contest between two men testing their strength and skill in head-up competition. On a campus which stresses classical form and expression, wrestling too has been emphasized at Columbia and the Lions will certainly be a force to be reckoned with in the Ivy League. A major reason for the Lions' success is their 12th-year head coach Ron Russo whose technical expertise, dedication and love of the sport is unsurpassed. Russo, himself an All-American wrestler for Bloomsburg State in the late '60's, showed his usual brand of guarded optimism stating, ""We will be fortunate to find ourselves somewhere in the middle of the Ivy League standings. If we continue to improve and peak during the key Ivy matches (in February) we could do well."" Thus far the Lions have demonstrated that constant improvement that Russo sees as critical. In two open tournaments the Lions fared well with several individuals placing in the top four. ""We wrestled well at the Central Jersey Open Tournament,"" said Russo adding ""I was quite pleased that we corrected mistakes we made the first weekend at the next tournament (the East Strousburg Open) after we worked on them in practice."" The Lions boast a quite impressive lineup, which must perform up to expectations if Columbia has any hope of repeating the Ivy League titles of 1980-82. Most noticeable is sophomore standout Chris Kane at 150 lbs. who last season finished with a 19-7-2 personal mark that included Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors, 2nd Team All-Ivy and freshman All-American distinctions. Kane could easily dominate the league and provides an almost guaranteed win at 150 lbs. Russo sees another sure spot in heavyweight with 250 lb. junior Richard Pilkington who is ""showing outstanding progress and dedication, and might become the league's premiere heavyweight."" This was evident at the Lions two tournaments where ""Pilk"" finished 3rd and 2nd losing to nationally-touted wrestlers. At 142 lbs.Donald Wallace has been working hard and should he stay injury-free, the Crystal Lake, Illinois native will figure at the top in the Ivies. Wallace's Kappa Delta Rho brother and teammate Scott Edwards is another regular returning to the Light Blue lineup and will provide stability at 158 lbs. Consistent wrestling from this group is vital to any hopes of dethroning Cornell from its twoyear reign at the top of the league. But as Russo dutifully pointed out, four or five guys does not a winning squad make. The questionable positions are the ones which separate the .500 teams from the league-winners. At 118 lbs., Columbia lacks experience but has two individuals who can wrestle well. Sophomore Bob Ingrahm and freshman Ken Gaudreau, brother of all-Ivy grappler Ed Gaudreau (Class of '84), are capable of making this slot a strength. At 126 pounds sophomore Dave Barry, if he puts it together, can be an excellent addition as he proved last season with flurries of brilliance. 134 lbs. sees the return of junior Jon Vogt after a one-year hiatus from the wrestling program. At 167 lbs. we will probably see sophomore Joe Rojas who had some rough breaks last year but has worked hard. The 177-lbs. division has been a pleasant surprise to Russo with the return of Yugoslavian goat herder Miles Vukelic after several seasons missed because of injuries and personal reasons. Vukelic looked sharp at the season's first tournament garnering first-place honors. Perhaps the team's greatest question mark, concedes Russo, is at 190 lbs. with senior Jeff Roylance who is slow to recover from last season's injuries. The Ivy League is always a tough thing to predict with intangibles like injuries and academic problems playing a large role. Russo however states, ""I think we could be back in the right direction with what I have seen. Will these guys want to continue wrestling the way they have is the question. You can not always tell in a school like this.'' What Russo of course is referring to is the difficulty of putting 100 percent into a sport while at the same time attending a■■i & hly-pressured institution. ""I am very excited about this team. All they have to do is find themselves as a team, find a personality."" There certainly seems to be ample talent on this Lion squad. With the Ivy League and the problems that every school has with injuries and lack of depth, luck plays a major role. ""I just hope we can be relaxed and loose and just go out there and wrestle like I know we are capable."" With Russo's fine guidance this squad could very well be on the road to a highly successful season.UNDER MY CHIN: Ron Russo, who begins his twelfth season as Columbia's wrestling coach, hopes his squad can rebound from last year's disappointing fifth place Ivy finish."
52,Faculty meets with UAW reps,31 January 1985,"By ELIZABETH SCHWARTZAbout forty faculty members showed up at a forum last night to question District 65 organizers about the union's complaints against the university and about what they should do in case of a strike. ""The meeting is because faculty wanted to have a meeting where they could find out the issues involved,"" said Krista Page, a clerical worker at the Law School who supports the union. But Vice President of District 65 Julie Kushner began the meeting by explaining that representatives from both sides reached an agreement yesterday afternoon that, if ratified by the support staffers, will avert the strike the union called for this Monday.At the meeting, Eric Fon;r, professor of history and member of a faculty coalition supporting the union, said that close to 150 professors, assistant, adjunct, and associate professors as well as Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities instructors have asked the coalition to help them find rooms off campus to hold their classes. Other professors have said they would hold classes in their apartments. James Kuhn, a professor at the Business School, moderated the discussion. ""We know what we've picked up from the papers and heard by word of mouth, which is not the best way,"" he told the group. President Sovern was invited to attend the meeting or to send someone in his place. But Sovern was out of town and he did not send anyone. ""It was felt that if [Vice President for Personnel Management Robert] Early came, this might have been a bit of a confrontational session,"" Foner said. ""Given the important position of the agreement, it was better not to have confrontation. I believe that if there had not been this agreement someone [from the administration] would have come,"" he continued. Foner asked faculty members present to indicate if they wanted to hold their classes off-campus. Foner has been involved with a faculty coalition that has been trying to find spaces off-campus where professors who did not want to cross the picket line can hold classes. ""It seems not to be necessary now,"" Foner said to one professor who asked him after the meeting about where she could hold her class. Foner said that Teacher's College, the Barnard College Women's Center, the Assention School, International House, the Riverside Church, the Olympia Theater, Union Theological Seminary and the Jewish Theological Seminary offered rooms. Kushner said that it is important for faculty to hold classes off campus if thereis a strike. ""It draws attention to our struggle—that is the most important thing."" She said that the union is not asking professors to show their support for the union by canceling classes, because the union does not want to interfere with the educational aims of the faculty and the students. ""Our best bet is not to take up issue with the students,"" Kushner said. ""Our real pro blems are with the administration."" Kushner added that if there is a strike or Monday, the union will ask students not tc cross the picket line ""unless it is essential for their education."" Therefore, she said, the union will not expect students to honor the picket line if they have a class inside a building on campus. She said that if students do have to cross the line then the union will ask them to sign a petition urging the university to call an end to the strike, and also spend time walking the picket line after that class is over. Kushner said that this was the policy that the clerical union had at Yale about students attending classes. ""They [the Yale union] did many innovative things and taught us some lessons,"" she said. She said that the Yale clerical union is ""making tremendous gains in comparable worth. They are setting the precedent that unionized workers can gain support. They gave us confidence."" She added, ""If the vote [today] is to avert the strike, we want to extend our thanks"" to the faculty and students who have supported the union. The largest concern of the faculty members present was that they have not been well informed about the demands of the union or about the history of the unionuniversity conflict. Kushner explained that with 1000 support staff in 42 buildings there was no time to visit each academic department. ""We have had to focus on helping keep the support staff informed,"" she said. ""Not having access is the problem."" she said. She added that the university has not given the union an updated mailing list of the support staff ■"
53,Changes planned in science core,7 March 1985,"By JOHN OSWALDExpressing frustration and a desire for change, 20 Columbia students met last week with Dean of the College Robert Pollack and Physics Professor David Helfand'to discuss the changes in the College science requirement that are currently being looked at by the College Committee on Instruction (COI). Pollack explained that the COI is now looking at the development of less technical courses for the non-science major as well as the possibility of allowing College students to fulfill their science requirements by taking two different one semester courses. Currently, students have to take the same science for a full year. The meeting, which was held in John Jay Lounge, was sponsored by the Columbia College Student Council. The Council's Academic Affairs and College Policy Committee recently conducted a survey of 134 students which found that 36 percent said they were dissatisfied with the science requirement as it is currently structured. 59 percent, however, said they were satisfied with the current structure. AH but one of the students who complained were nonscience majors. They pointed out that large lectures and technical labs make some courses too difficult for the nonscience major. Helfand, who was chair of the Ad Hoc Committee of Columbia College on Science in a Liberal Curriculum, has said he wants ""people to come out of Columbia College not afraid of science."" The science requirement, according to Helfand, is ""going towards the goal of science literacy."" Scientific literacy, as defineoby the May 1983 report from Helfand's committee, is an understanding of scientific perspective and the culture of science. The former involves the scientist's perception of a problem and the manner in which he or she goes about solving it. An introduction to theculture of science, according to the report, should give the student a broad view of the major ideas which underlie the wide-ranging disciplines of modern science. Pollack said he felt the current science offerings do not meet the Ad Hoc Committee's specifications and lack cohesiveness. He said they were a random group of courses from which students must pick one to satisfy the requirement. In the past, Pollack has suggested that the course, The Theory and Practice of Science, be developed into something like the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization programs. The Ad Hoc Committee's original proposal called for the development of a one-point additional course requirement that would consist of 10 late afternoon or evening lectures each semester on topics covering the major ideas underlying modern science. The Council's poll found 64 percent of students in favor of the additional course. However, Pollack said that this idea was not followed up because of the difficulty of monitoring lecture attendance. College Senior Claude Catapano, a member of the COI, said that the committee is reviewing courses that fulfull the science requirement to see if they are still up to COI standards. So far, Astronomy has been reapproved, he said. One course, Introductory Physical Geography, has already been dropped from the list of courses that fulfill the requirement, he added. He explained that the action will not affect students who have already taken or are currently taking geography. Catapano said that he is hopeful the course review will be completed by the end of this school year so that the new proposals can be passed. He added that if the review is not completed this year, the changes in the science requirement definitely will be in effect in school year 1986-87."
54,Some professors will respect blockade,7 April 1985,"By TED KENNEY and JENNIFER LYNCHThe University has not announced, whether it will relocate classes scheduled to meet in Hamilton Hall this Monday. However, some faculty members said they will honor the Coalition for a Free South Africa's request not to enter the blockaded building. A few professors said that they have organized to find new locations for classes and that they will urge faculty members to respect the blockade. Yesterday evening Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of Columbia College, said the University administration was making no attempt to reschedule the classes. He said he would argue against faculty members conducting classes elsewhere. Late yesterday night, Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka said ""The decision [to move the classes] hasn't been made yet."" Lehecka noted that 1,500 students have classes in Hamilton before 1:00 on Monday. Lehecka also said that any decision would not be made solely by the College, since other schools also hold classes in Hamilton. The Coalition's intentions regarding use of Hamilton Hall were not clearly stated until last night, when Assistant Professor of Sociology Eric Hirsch, Assistant Professor of History Elizabeth Blackmar, and Professor of History Eric Foner met withthe Coalition Steering Committee to arrange a concerted effort of students and faculty members to support Coalition actions. Hirsch said that his and the Coalition's goal now is to get classes out of Hamilton, and that faculty members themselves can decide whether they want to hold classes elsewhere or stop teaching them entirely. Also, he said a meeting to discuss the issue has been called for faculty members at noon on Monday on the lawn facing Hamilton. As a result of the meeting with the Coalition, Hirsch said that he, Blackmar and Foner agreed to telephone ""about fifty"" faculty members who are scheduled to teach at Hamilton on Monday and try to convince them not to teach there ""I think it would be difficult to hold classes in Hamilton Hall in a normal fashion,"" Foner said, due to noise and commotion. Many faculty members contacted by Spectator last night said they would not conduct business at Hamilton on Monday. Literature Humanities instructor Josh Hanft said he does not teach in Hamilton, but that he will not go there to conduct his scheduled office hours as long as the protest continues. Priscilla Wald, another Lit Hum instructor, said, ""I intend to hold classes, but not in Hamilton Hall."" ""I would say that at least half of the Lit Hum instructors will not hold classes in Hamilton Hall,"" Wald said, ""but most will hold classes somewhere."" However, some professors said the blockade would not affect the way theyconduct business. ""I intend to be in my office and my secretary does too,"" said Robert Hanning, Professor of English and head of the English department. ""Since this is an issue on which men of good will can disagree, I feel no moral compulsion to stay out of the building."" When asked if he would teach his classes in Hamilton on Monday, Professor of Philosophy David Sidorsky said ""of course."" Professor of English and Comparative Literature James Mirollo called the blockade ""hijinx, a spring revel,"" which damages a cause that is ""much too worthy to be served by singing and chanting."" Mirollo said he would teach classes in Hamilton on Monday, as did Professor of English and Comparative Literature Carl Hovde. But other professors expressed support for the demonstration. Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature Constance Jordan said, ""My guess is I won't hold classes in Hamilton, but I will hold them somewhere else."" Some professors went to the other extreme, vowing not to hold their classes until the protest is over Assistant Professor of Geography Neil Smith does not teach in Hamilton, but he said he will stop holding classes entirely in order to support the Coalition. ""I think it's time to say, 'okay, no business as usual, let's talk this whole thing out,"" he said. Smith added that ""a lot of faculty members are spontaneously, by themselves, not holding classes at all."""
55,Many professors may boycott Hamilton Hall,8 April 1985,"By TED KENNEYAlthough many faculty members have expressed a desire to support the Coalition for a Free South Africa's blockade of Hamilton Hall by not teaching there today, most instructors reached by Spectator last night expressed uncertainty as to when and where their classes would be held. Despite efforts by some faculty to organize a boycott of Hamilton Hall, the building was expected to be open for business and classes today. ""I am told that there is sufficient notice up that people will know how to get to the tunnel in Kent,"" said Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka, referring to the entrance to Hamilton that is not blockaded. He added that administrators have tried to call faculty members to tell them how to get into the building. Assistant Professor of History Elizabeth Blackmar said that she, Professor of History Eric Foner and Assistant Professor of History Eric Hirsch said they are continuing their efforts, in cooperation with the Coalition, to persuadefaculty members to boycott Hamilton.Blackmar did not say how many professors .hey had reached by phone, but emphasized that much of the coordination of faculty members will take place at the faculty meeting scheduled for noon today on the lawn in front of Hamilton. Two instructors called Spectator yesterday to announce that their classes would be held outside of Hamilton. Professor Philip Silver of the Spanish department said he would hold classes in Casa Hispanica. Literature Humanities instructor Steve Nadler said his classes would be held in 712 Philosophy. Literature Humanities instructor Priscilla Wald said she has found an alternative on-campus location for her classes, and Russian instructor Deborah Martinson said she would hold class in her apartment. Both said they had already contacted their students.SPECTATOR/BEN GAUSON SAY CHEESE: Students pass the time under the tarp at Hamilton yesterday by reading, talking—or telling Thoreau jokes."
56,Spectator Spectrum U.S. policies are problem,21 October 1985,"U.S. policies are problemBy TIMOTHY BRENNANWith this article, Spectrum begins a series of columns on Central America written by Columbia students and faculty members. The idea for the column grew out of meetings of the recently formed Columbia Students in Solidarity With Nicaragua.The title of this column, ""Nuestra America,"" may require an explanation. It is taken from a well-known essay written in 1891 by the Cuban nationalist Jose Marti in a Spanishlanguage New York publication, La Revista Illustrada. Marti, who lived in New York from 1881 to 1895, had earlier been expelled from Cuba for his efforts to support Cuban independence from Spain. An enthusiastic student of North American culture, Marti wrote extensively on figures like Walt Whitman, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Crane, contrasting the relative democracy in the United States with the authoritarian, feudal framework that Spain had imposed on much of Latin America. In his essay, Marti predicted the dangers of the eventual economic and political absorption of Spanish America by its powerful northern neighbor. This prediction borne out shortly after his death by the United States' first concerted militaryoperation in the Caribbean—the conquest of Cuba against Spanish forces in 1898, the so-called ""Spanish-American War."" The U.S. effectively controlled Cuba until 1959. I recall Marti's essay because its message seems relevant to the current situation in Central America. He distinguished between ""Our America"" (""Nuestra America"") and the ""Other America""—Anglo-Saxon America. The North, he argued, despite its own democratic traditions and struggle for independence, was unaware of the conditions prevailing in the South. This ignorance had led to scorn, Marti felt, and would combine with other, less-flattering U.S. traditions (its expansion westward and unbridled business interests) to create the conditions for North American domination of the weak, newlyformed republics of Latin America. For this reason, Marti'sefforts in the U.S. were directed at those who recognized the need to respect Latin America's popular indigenous traditions, and its special problems. For such people, ""Our America"" would mean the Americas as a whole, not just the United States. The United States is conducting covert activity in Nicaragua, a bombing campaign in El Salvador, the militarization of Honduras and Costa Rica, and the basing of troops in Puerto Rico, Panama, and Guantanamo Bay. In addition, the U.S. continues to provide decisive military aid to discredited regimes in Guatemala and Haiti. All of this is part of a long process of intervention that began in 1823 with the Monroe Doctrine, which proclaimed to Europe that the New World was ""ours""—a U.S. ""sphere of influence."" From 1898 onwards, the history of the Caribbean has been the history of U.S. military intervention or occupation in a number of countries, including Puerto Rico (1898), Nicaragua (1910, 1917-23), Mexico (1916), Guatemala (1954), Cuba (1961), the Dominican Republic (1965), and many others. In the last six years, more than 100,000 Central Americans have been killed by U.S.-backed governments—ss,ooo in Guatemala alone. Our government's problem is not its ""indecision"" or ""lack of a clear foreign policy."" On the contrary, our government is doing precisely what it intends to do—to undermine the integrity of Latin American nations to the economic and political advantage of the United States. If we are going to fight against today's escalating war effectively, we have to realize that our government's current policy is not just failing to solve the problem.

57,Women's studies for the College is investigated by several groups,7 November 1985,"By JENNIFER LYNCHSeveral Columbia College committee are addressing the question of developing a women's studies program in response to a report issued last May by the Ad Hoc Committee on Women's Studies, but deans for the undergraduate schools say they think student interest in such a program may not be very widespread. The report by the committee, chaired by Gillian Lindt, dean of the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences (GSAS), recommended establishing a minor in women's studies in the school of General Studies as well as providing more research support to students in GSAS. It also recommended that Columbia College deans appoint a committee to investigate gender studies in the remoteness requirement. The proposal for a new Institute for Research-on Women and Gender Studies announced last week also came from this committee. The Institute, which will open next July if it is approved by the Board of Trustees and the University Senate, will coordinate women's studies throughout the University. Columbia College will not be offering a major or a concentration in gender studies at this point because it does not have the resources, according to Michael Rosenthal, associate dean of Columbia College, and a member of the Lindt committee.Rosenthal also said he was not sure how widespread student interest in a specific women's studies program would be. He added that the Lindt committee requested the publication of a manual on teaching gender studies in the core curriculum. ""There has not been that much interest among the students in the past"" for a minor in women's studies, said Ward Dennis, dean of the School of General Studies, adding that most of the GS students are changing careers and have specific career goals. Dennis said his school's Committee on Instruction will study extensively the report's recommendation for a minor in women's studies before adopting such a plan. Stephanie Smallwood, CC '87, the coordinator of the Columbia College Women's Center and a member of the Lindt committee, said that the committee has not reached a consensus on whether to establish a major or concentration on women's studies in Columbia College. She said that some members of the committee think the college's faculty is too small to provide for it. She added that students need to be encouraged to think about women's studies. ""It's very revolutionary and it's not the kind of thing a college student is going to consider on his or herown,"" she said. ""The problem with women's studies is that it's very young as a field and it's not a specific discipline,"" Smallwood continued. ""It means going back and revamping a lot of the disciplines we study."" Another result of the Lindt committee is the formation of the Women in Contemporary Civilization Committee. Felice Lifshitz, a spokesperson for this committee, said that five Contemporary Civilizations professors who are also members of this group have added gender studies to their syllibi. Lifshitz said she has not changed the way she conducts her C.C. section as a result of the committee, nor has she added any new authors to her syllabus. ""You don't need to add more texts to talk about categories of gender. It's there,"" she said. She explained that she has always tried to incorporate an awareness of women into her C.C. class . She has used methods including asking more exam questions and assigning more paper topics on women. She added, however, that other faculty members were becoming interested in the committee's suggestions to include women's studies into the core and expressed interest in the committee's bibliography on women's studies. Car! Hovde, director of Literature Humanities and professor of English, said he has thought about adding women's studies into the course but has not worked out the details. He said he has not apointed a committee to look into the question, but rather is looking it himself. ' 'I certainly think it is a good idea and should be done,"" Hovde said. Adding to the myriad of committees that have been recently established to look into women's studies at the University,there are two student groups studying the possibilities for including women's studies in Columbia College's curriculum. Emira Woods, CC '88, and a member of the Student Council's Academic Affairs Committee, said that a subcommittee has been addressing the issue since last month. According to Woods, they are writing letters to departmental chairs advocating the addition of women's and black studies curricula, which would eventually lead to starting departments in both subjects. Woods said she would eventually like to see majors and concentrations in both areas. Woods said the committee was also interested in adding both women's and black studies to the core curriculum, citing the study of jazz in Music Humanities as an example. Lifshitz said that in her C.C. class she has already been teaching the role of blacks, although this discussion does not take place until late in the course. ""I do think that most people see all of these issues as tremendously interrelated,"" she said. ""One group's oppression is very related to another group's oppression."" Robert Radtke, chair of the Student Committee on Coeducation, which is under the Student Council, said that his committee is also looking into establishing more women's studies courses at Columbia College.* ""I don't think students think about it enough,"" Radtke said. He added that the committee's goal is to ""come up with a number of courses that seem plausible."" Radtke said that he, too, would like to see a major in women's studies, but said that this would be impossible right now because there are not enough courses in the area offered at Columbia College."
58,Jane Austen now required in spring Lit Hum syllabus,20 January 1986,"By ANDREA CHIPMANCoeducation will take on a new meaning this spring as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice becomes the first text by a woman to become required reading for Columbia College's Humanities course. Members of the Lit Hum faculty voted just before the semester's end to put the novel on the Lit Hum syllabus. The question of whether to include a work by a woman on the syllabus had been discussed for more than a year, according to James Mirollo, a former chair of the Literature Humanities program. Lit Hum is a required course of the college's core curriculum. Until this year, works by women could fill the optional spot left at the end of the semester, but were not a mandatory part of the syllabus. Authors ranging from Virginia Woolf to George Elliot to Mme. de Lafayette were discussed and debated before the choice of Austen was made, Mirollo said. Mirollo admitted that some members of the faculty felt that Austen's work was not ""relevant"" to the rest of the syllabus, but said her significance as a respected woman author wasmore important than the work's ability to ""stand up"" by itself. Professor Carl Hovde, chair of the Literature Humanities program, commended the decision as ""a perfectly good thing to do,"" but added, ""the issues still need to be thought through."" Faculty members disagreed on whether the work chosen ought to directly discuss issues of feminism, or whether it was necessary only that the selection be written by a woman. It was strongly felt that the work chosen should not, according to Professor Wallace Gray,""smack of tokenism."" But Mirollo acknowledged that some professors had argued that Austen's connections with earlier classical works were not clear. The discussion regarding the addition to the curriculum raised other issues surrounding the study of ""Great Books."" According to Lit Hum faculty member Mary Campbell, Lit Hum texts are often selected more on the basis of intellectual tradition than as a result of a critical study of the works in question.vocated a reevaluation. ""These students should have a course that reflects their own historical experiences,"" he said. Blount suggested that such a new outlook on the principles of the Literature Humanities course might be more accurately presented through the addition of a third semester requirement. Such an additional semester might deal with 19th and 20th century works by a variety of authors from different cultures.Other members of the Humanities faculty have voiced their interest in an extension of the Humanities Curriculum, although it is doubtful such an addition could be developed in the immediate future, according to Blount. Gray admitted that such a course might be desirable, but added that the issue demands careful study. ""It would require a real looking into, not just a Literature Humanities staff meeting.""""Enlightened prejudice is behind the choices of most works in the second semester, because none of them is a canonical work for all of Western culture as works of Classical antiquity are,"" she said. Campbell suggested that in future years, the Literature Humanities syllabus might be required to adapt so as to truly represent the individual heritages of students at Columbia. Such adaptation would include the addition of works by other minorities, not only woman authors. Marcellus Blount, a lecturer in the Afro-American literature department, also advocated a reevaluation. ""These students should have a course that reflects their own historical experiences,"" he said. Blount suggested that such a new outlook on the principles of'the Literature Humanities course might be more accurately presented through the addition of a third semester requirement.

59,OFF THE WALK Cheap books a hot commodity,23 January 1986,"Cheap books a hot commodityBy SHELAGH LAFFERTYLast semester, Michael Shakib, Columbia College Class of 'g<s president, was startled and annoyed when his bill at the Columbia University Bookstore for his Contemporary Civilization books came to more than $100. This semester, he has decided to take his and many of his classmates' business elsewhere. Shakib and other Class of '89 officers have organized a cutrate Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization book service, which enables students to buy the required books for these courses at a 23 !4 percent discount off final costs including tax. Shakib struck a bargain with Eeyore's Bookstore on 80th St.and Broadway, guaranteeing bulk orders of the paperbacks needed for the courses. According to the terms of the agreement, Shakib and his cohort received the books for 15 percent off list price and were not required to pay the 8 'A percent New York Sales tax. This semester the freshman classjordered approximately 700 books. ""All freshmen have to enroll in either CC or lit Hum and they spend a lot of money on their books. Book Forum and Barnes and Noble sell the books at list price because most of the books are paperbacks and already have the price printed on them,"" Shakib said. The order should be completed and books ready for purchase today, Shakib said, although difficulties filling the order arose because the different sections have different syllabi. Still, most textbooks cannot be ordered through the freshman class service and must be purchased at bookstores on campus. Generally, textbooks at the University bookstore costa few dollars less per book than those at Book Forum. For instance, two books edited by Robert Tucker, The Marx Engels Reader and The Lenin Anthology, required for some CC sections, cost $10.95 and $14.95 respectively at The Columbia University Bookstore and cost $12.95 and $16.95 respectively at Book Forum. Nick Staskiewicz, manager of Book Forum, said prices on textbooks at his store might be higher than those at the Barnes and Noble/Columbia University Bookstore because Barnes and Noble is a major wholesaler and can afford to sell each text at a lower cost because it can make up the loss in the sale of other items. ""It's all a marketing concept. They can put their textbooks in the far corners of the storeand charge a little less because along the way, students are going to pick up some pens, paper, a couple of notebooks and maybe a sweatshirt."" ""They put the books in strategic places so that people buy other things as well at an enormous markup. We can't afford those options."" Staskiewicz said. In addition, Staskiewicz said that next year the publishing industry would be switching from the list pricing concept to a net pricing concept, which would eliminate prices being stamped on paperback books. Instead, magnetic bar codes would be used. If the book service the freshman class officers have establish is successful and students show continued interest in it, Shakib said they would try to get five more books discounted, including textbooks. In addition, the officers are considering instituting a service in which students could place their used books on consignment in order to get better return rates than those offered by the campus bookstores. According to Jim Carbone, CC'B7 and a member of the University Senate's Student Affairs Committee, the Senate is looking into establishing a book cooperative. ""Right now it's only in its formative stages, but eventually we'd like to have a used bookstore on campus,"" Carbone said and explained that they would like to see the bookstore become part of Student Activities. The Senate is looking for funding to start the bookstore, Carbone added.SIGNING OVER THE ESTATE: Each semester, Columbia students part with their cash in pursuit of a well-stocked library"
60,"Spectator Spectrum AT ISSUE: New syllabus decision is just ""the beginning""",29 January 1986,"AT ISSUE:New syllabus decision is just ""the beginning""By CARL F. HOVDEOne of the snappier remarks about Humanities A was made by the late Moses Hadas, a distinguished classicist who was fond of the course and taught it for many years. ' 'The name, he said, ""should be changed. The first semester should be called 'Books', and the second 'More Books'."" I persist in calling it ""Humanities A"" because I dislike the current ""Literature Humanities""; it is not, and should not be, only literature. Hadas' comment reflects the difficulty of defining precisely what Humanities does. The works are read in chronological order, but the course is not really one in the history of anything: not of Greek thought, not of French, not of anyother. No course can responsibly be called history which moves so rapidly with so thin a sense of context. What it does do is direct attention to a sizeable number of major Western texts; students read and discuss a good many works of literature, history, and philosophy—not enough philosophy now, I think. The discussion is the essence; a teacher who lectured all the time would not be doing the job. The staff members work hard to make the experience valuable in itself, and they hope that it will also lead students to learn more about those authors and periods that they find particularly interesting.The course should lead students to come back later to Montaigne, or to Sophocles, or to Homer and think more about the issues, whether this is done in or out of the classroom. When the staff talks about the syllabus the discussion of the spring list is always longer and more difficult than that about the fall. In significant measure the fall list was created by the disappearance of many of the works not on it: there were many more Greek playwrights than those whose work we read, and even with the four we have most of their works have been lost. In the second term, on the other hand, the problem is to choose between an increasingly large number of available works, and the staff discussion is naturally colored by the varying backgrounds and interests represented. The essential thing is the basic assumption about the course—that when the staff settles on a work, it will be taught in all classes. Last term, in the discussion of works to be taught this spring, the staff for the first time decided that the list should contain a work by a woman. The Princess of Cleves was initially chosen, but Pride and Prejudice was the final choice. There was some feeling (which I shared) that George Eliot's Middlemarch would be more appropriate, since it has a massiveness and cultural complexity characteristic of most of the other Humanities texts. But I have no doubt that the Austen novel will work well in class; it is obviously one of the finest novels in English, and a preference for Middiemarch in this context doesn't mean that one thinks Eliot a greater novelist than Austen. Humanities is only part of the core curriculum, and the core is in turn only part of a student's experience here. The thing for us all to remember is that the introduction of a work by a woman is not the end of our necessary thought, but rather the beginning. Women's Studies in general are at an early stage of their development at Columbia, though for some individual teachers it is not a new matter at all, of course. The College, like the University, has been giving attention to Women's Studies in recent years, but this has necessarily been in the form of committee investigations, reports, and some curricular experiments. What happens in Humanities cannot and must not be isolated from what is happening elsewhere in the curriculum, and we must inform ourselves about these other lines of inquiry.Next year will see, among other anniversaries, the fiftieth year that Humanities has been a required course. It has remained a vital enterprise above all else because of the committment of those teaching it, and their willingness to work together in a fruitful way. There are fresh interests now, and all of this is going to require some organized attention in addition to individual thought. It is necessary that we press ourinterests with civility and some patience in a context of inevitably varying opinion; I am sure that we will do this. Even if there were to be some rancor, there is one thing much worse: indifference. If the staff should ever cease to care, the course would surely die of its own weight—but of this, lam happy to report, there is not the slightest sign.Pride and Prejudice in Lit HumCarl F.

61,How College could pioneer new core,29 January 1986,"By HELENE P. FOLEY# In the past ten years, many American colleges and universities have reevaluted their general education curricula. Swarthmore College recently ""considered the value of mastering a common body of knowledge, such as the history of Western civilization and its developing philosophical, political and scientific thought, but felt that such a traditional canon would give a deceptively narrow view of the world and its development."" Barnard College reached a similar decision in a curricular review of three years ago. Its required freshman seminar program emphasizes—like a number of other colleges—the acquisition of writing and discussion skills through an interdisciplinary study of important texts relating to a theme. The thematic organization of each seminar allows choice to students and permits faculty to venture in their selection of texts outside the typical Western canon. Many instructors have made a deliberate choice to include texts by women and writers of color, or to emphasize East-West relations. Among those schools which have, like Columbia, maintained or adopted some form of Western culture requirement, an enormous variety of programs exist. At Stanford University, for example, students can select, to fulfill their Western culture requirement, courses from a variety of ""tracks"". Some of these tracks make a point of teaching the Western tradition from a more questioning and critical vantage point than others. The recent controversy over the teaching of a novel by a woman in Literature Humanities in my view indictes the need fora careful and thorough reevaluation of the curriculum, and not for small changes made piecemeal in the course of a faculty lunch with an already crowded agenda. In order to avoid what Swarthmore sees as a ""deceptively narrow view of the world,"" there are two approaches which can be adopted. The first is curricular modification, the second involves encouraging facul-ty to educate each other about new, more critical modes of approaching the teaching of the Western tradition. I would like to offer some observations about each of these approaches. I will confine myself to the questions recently raised concerning women and the canon in the Literature Humanities course,although they are by no means the only issues needing reconsideration. Texts by women could enhance the syllabus in both semesters of the course without sacrificing thematic continuity (in so far as thematic continuity is present or desirable). Some Sappho fragments offer the direct reactions of a female poet to myths and themes prominent in the Homeric poems, and it seems worthwhile to consider once again why lyric poetry as a genre is excluded from most Western culture courses. As is the case with lyric poetry, women writers played an important and formative role in the development of the Western novel, and it is appropriate to recognize this contribution— especially at this historical moment—by including a novel by a woman in the syllabus. Indeed, it might be advisable to allow instructors much more latitude to choose their texts in, for example, the final month of the course. They could then experiment with books or themes that are especially interesting to them or their students, and make a point of including perspectives (or genres) which had received little or no emphasis in the first three quarters of the course. It is also important to consider whether the particular texts by men chosen throughout the curriculum lend themselves to the examination of issues concerning women. Most of the texts in the fall semester—e.g., the Oresteia, Antigone, Medea, the Republic—confront directly controversial issues concerning gender. Indeed, these issues and conflicts are so central to the structure and meaning of the texts that an instructor must find it difficult to avoid a critical discussion of them. In the process the student can gain a valuable perspective on the origins of the Western attitude towards sex roles. The texts in the second semester are currently not so well adapted for these purposes and might require some appropriate substitutions. Even in the first semester, small changes in the syllabus could enrich the course. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, for example, offers a female perspective on themes central to the Iliad and Odyssey. By emphasizing the mother/daughter relation, a critical attitude to marriage and an alternative ancient view of mortality, this elegant poem broadens considerably our view of ancient female experience (to say nothing of ancient religious experience) on both the divine and mortal levels. As regards the teaching of Literature Humanities, instructors who wish to consider including or emphasizing in their teaching issues concerning gender, or want to re-examine their teaching of the Western tradition, can benefit considerably from formal assistance. The brief Monday lunches for instructors are not the place to undertake this process. Many schools have offered their faculty the benefit of seminars by experts on these topics, followed by internal dialogue. The Columbia program might well profit from adopting this approach. The Literature Humanities course must be able to withstand the scrutiny of its present instructors and students and to defend anew the teaching of the Western tradition in a changing and far more internationally-oriented modern reality. Indeed, Columbia, as a pioneer in introducing such courses, should undertake a leading role in this critical process. From my experience at both Stanford and Barnard,' faculty and student collaboration on these questions has proved exciting rather than burdensome and has enhanced the educational experience of all concerned.Helene P. Foley is an Associate Professor of Classics and Co-chair of the Women's Studies Program for 1985-86 at Barnard College. She has taught Western culture courses at Harvard, Stanford and Columbia."
62,Lit Hum needs a newer Canon,29 January 1986,"By MARY CAMPBELLI was misrepresented in a Spectator article last week (Jan. 20) as having ""suggested that in future years, the Literature Humanities syllabus might be required to adapt so as to truly represent the individual heritages of students at Columbia."" That is an impossible aim and, were it met, the result would not be Lit Hum. Lit Hum is a course in the Canon, and the Canon, whatever else it may be, is not a democratic aggregate of works by everybody's ancestors. What I did suggest was that neither is the Canon a fixed and immutable index: writers and critics and editors are always reshaping it and institutions like Lit Hum have a hand in that process. The Canon of late twentieth century American culture does not come to an end in 1641 with Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, as our syllabus might have indicated, and it does include non-European works, works by women, works by blacks. The question a refreshed syllabus must answer is the question ""who are we, and which writers have led us here?"" It is not social justice that demands the wider variety of texts on the Lit Hum syllabus, but the facts of history, because it is from history that a canon emerges. Some very fine literary works have not become canonical because (to oversimplify wildly) they had no influence, no widespread resonance within a part of the metaculture we call the West. Perhaps in an analogy with the recent interest of physicists in ""shadow matter"", we should institute a ""shadow Lit Hum"", consisting of the surpressed, censored, prohibited and silenced literary voices of ""the West"". But Lit Hum itself is a representation of the audible voices of power in our heritage. My suggestion is simply that we admit, as an institution, the actual variety and actual power of those voices, the variety of subcultures which constitute this culture. The power and influence of, for instance, Frederick Douglass' Autobiography or Virginia Wolf's A Room of One's Own are not waiting to be established. They have been. It would not be a revolutionary act of canonization to include such works in the syllabus. It would be a simple admission that women, blacks, Americans belong to the constituency of literature: that works which have inspired action and imitation among ""them"" have, in so doing, inspired action and imitation among ""us"".Mary Campbell is a Mellon Fellow in Literature and an instructor ot Literature Humanities."
63,Grad students' teaching core has some worried,7 February 1986,"By MILES POMPERThe course is taught by a selected staff of young faculty members and senior professors. This description of Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), taken from the 1985-86 Columbia College Bulletin, is similar to the description of another course in the Columbia College core curriculum, Contemporary Civilizations, (C.C.) but more than one third of the course instructors of both these courses are not senior, nor even tenured-track faculty, but graduate students. The use of these graduate preceptors continues to be a source of controversy among the faculties of these two departments. Graduate students account for 35 percent of the instructors in Lit. Hum. and 39 percent of the teachers in C.C. Some professors have expressed dismay at the proportion of graduate instructors claiming they are unqualified toteach the courses, and that their use has destroyed the whole notion of the core. Supporters of the current argument argue that graduate students are as qualified to teach the core as senior faculty. Graduate English Department Chair Steven Marcus said he thinks there are too many graduate students teaching core courses. ""It's always been our ideal to lower it (the number of graduate students) as much as possible,"" Marcus said. Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal agreed that there are too many graduate preceptors. ""If I could create the ideal percentage, it would be a little lower,"" he said. But current Lit Hum Chair Carl Hovde, said he approves of the present situation. ""Ideally one wants to have a mix. I don't think the pro-portion of graduate students should go too high, but I think we're at the proper level now,"" said Hovde. In addition, graduate students teaching core courses have come under fire by even students in their classes as unqualified and unprepared. ""I don't think my teacher is really qualified yet, maybe in two or three years when she loosens up in the classroom,"" said one member of CC '89 who asked not to be indentified. Many members of these departments, though, said there are faculty members who are as unqualified as graduate students. ""There are as many first-rate teachers among the preceptors as among the faculty, proportionally,"" maintained Professor Richard Brilliant, chair of the C.C. department. Over the past decade, the number of graduate students teaching core courses has increased. Lit Hum officials attributed the shift to a combination of the large cuts in faculty made during the McGill administration in the 70's; the abolition of the financial incentive for senior faculty members to teach core courses; and the decision by the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) requiring its students to take one year of Lit Hum or C.C. Professor James Mirollo, a former chair of the Lit Hum department, tied the increase in core preceptors to the financial cutbacks made during the 1970'5. ""During the austerity decade of the 70's, our staff was cut drastically. For instance, we had twice as many assistant professors of English as now."" When the various departments from which the core classes draw their instructors shrunk drastically, the sections were filled withgraduate students. Ten years ago, senior faculty were each given $2000 in grants to research their core classes over the summer, but the program was cancelled because of a lack of funds. The grant was similar to the current Chamberlain awards, which award junior faculty a paid semester off after teaching a core course for three years. English Professor John D. Rosenburg said he believes the senior faculty program should be resurrected. ""I think that it would smbolize a recognition on the part of the college that these courses do stand at the center of Columbia education. I think it (the recognition) would be valuable in getting more people into the Core and holding people there,"" said Rosenberg. Some professors said that no incentive will encourage more senior faculty members to teach the Core courses. Marcus said he did not have enough time to teach Lit Hum. ""I'm sorry I have to forego teaching in the humanities. It's not a matter of choice, but the time available made it impossible to go on teaching humanities."" ""These courses are generally not within their [senior faculty] area of interest,"" remarked Assistant Professor of History Laurence Dickey. ""There's a lot of extra time in class, and a lot of specialists feel the teaching is kind of spongey."" Hovde attributed the increase in the number of preceptors to SEAS's decision to require a core course for its students the major reason for the increased number of preceptors. ""The additional sections from the Engineering school have been staffed by our graduate students. We haven't been able to staff it with people form other departments or their curriculum begins to deteriorate."""
64,Judith Katz,19 March 1986,"1. Columbia should not assist any organization to recruit on campus that has an overt discriminatory policy. Such an organization should have the opportunity to rent a room on campus and arrange to meet with students there, however, Career Services and Placement Service should not assist in these arrangements. The University must make it clear that it does not approve of discrimination of any kind as is set forth in its statement on nondiscriminatory policies. 2. The Senate is the only place where students, faculty, and administrators meet regularly to discuss issues of importance to their constituents and to the University. Unfortunately, instead of dealing with these issues many are sent to committees where they become lost. The Senate must begin to address these issues. 3. One study day before exams is not enough. A resolution to increase the reading period was submitted to the Senate over a year ago where it was promptly sent to committee. It has been in committee long enough and must now be brought to the Senate floor. 4. The administration avoids consulting with students and faculty when making decisions which directly affect us. This should not be the case. Attempts have been made in the past year for students to meet more with administrators by the Student Council through their informal meetings with administrators in dormitories and by the Senate Student Affairs Committee with the Low Library Open House. These steps should be continued. 5. Women and minority authors should be represented in the curriculum of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. It is inexcusable for groups that together comprise more than half of the popuia tion of this world to be simply overlooked. Lit Hum and CC should recognize that not all the great works of literature and philosophy were written by Western European men. 6. A student and a faculty member should both be voting members of the Board of Trustees. Resolutions passed by the Senate are only recommendations to the Board of Trustees, who decide which recommendations to enforce and which to ignore. The Board of Trustees only know trhe administration's view when making these decisions, never the student's view or the faculty's view. Having the students and the faculty represented on the Board of Trustees would insure thatthey are aware of the opinions of the largest groups at Columbia who are most affected by the Board of Trustees' decisions. 7. There are several areas where students have absolutely no input. The most obvious is on the Board of Trustees. Another is in decisions concerning tenure. The university bases its selection for tenure on the research done by a professor and on his reputation. The students' concern is can these researchers also teach? This view is not considered when tenure is decided. Another area where students lack input is in the selection of students for the different administrators' committees. Presently an administrator decides who will be a member of the committee he is establishing. The committees' topics range from AIDS to the new dormitory.8. Good relations between students and their deans and advisors are important. They should not be risked by having deans and advisers identify students who are participating in demonstrations. Also, all conversations between a student and his adviser should be considered confidential and only be disclosed if the student's mental or physical well being is in jeopardy. 9. It is my assumption that a person who has AIDS is already receiving the proper medical treatment and assistance. For this reason, I see no reason why an AIDS patient would need to notify the University or Health Services. If anything, the University should be helping to find a cure to AIDS and educating the Columbia community on the facts concerning the disease."
65,Ellen Winer: at-large representative,24 March 1986,"1. The Marines should be allowed to recruit on campus in order to give interested students a full opportunity to find out about the possibilities available in the Marines and to complete the application processes. Also, there are other companies on campus suspected of following discriminatory policies, but in the interest of the student body all could not be banned. It is for individualstudents to decide whether or not they wish to be employed by a discriminatory organization, and not the University. 2. The Student Council is a representative body of the students and as such should work to carefully listen to and voice the concerns and needs of the students. The College Council should act as the representative ofthe student body to both the College administration and to that of the University as a whole. The Student Council allocates the student activity fee and must do so in an appropriate and just manner to ensure the maximum benefit for students. Finally, an important function of the Council is to maintain regular communication with the students, infor-munication with the students, informing them of its activities and any other pertinent information. 3. The reading period should be extended to give students the much needed additional time to prepare for exams. One study day is inadequate for proper preparation. If it is absolutely necessary to change the University schedule in order to extend the study period, such should be done. Hopefully any calendar change will not completely eliminate some sort of midterm break in the fall semester. 4. There is little interaction between the students and the faculty and administration on an informal basis. Most students, it seemsspeak to deans and professors only when they have specific questions or problems. It is the responsibility of all three groups to improve this lack of contact. The Student Council should help to alleviate this problem by continuing to hold forums with various administrators and faculty members and by encouraging other means of informal interaction. 5. NA 6. Both women and minority authors shoulc be better represented and integrated in Lit Hum and CC syllabi. At present such authors are included only in very small numbers to quiet complaints which have arisen in the past few years. These authors need to be considered an important part of the syllabi and included for their merits and contributions to Western civilization. 7. Both a student and a faculty member should be allowed to sit on the Board of Trustees and, optimally, be able to vote. The trustees make decisions which directly affect both the students and the faculty and, thus, their interests should be represented. Also, the Board of Trustees makes or approves all major University decisions and it only seems fit that the two groups which comprise the vast majority of the University community be involved in the decision-making process. 8. The University should develop a specific policy on AIDS for the benefit of both the patients themselves and the University community as a whole. AIDS patients should be required to report their illness as they would any similarly transmittable illness. Such information should be strictly confidential and be made known only to those for whom it is absolutely essential.continued from page three dent group, contact between University administrators is often minimal. Only at crucial times does one ever really deal directly with these administrators. However, many faculty members appear readily available to students. Therefore, communication with the school's administrators should be encouraged to access themselves of their teachers and faculty. 5. Senate only. 6. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses have limited perspectives, so including minority and women authors with similar perspectives is not very productive. What should be instituted, however, is a required Core Curriculum course dealing with the women/minority experiences which concentrate on the political ramifications of these experiences. 7. A student or faculty member who sits on the Board of Trustees, but is not accountable to the student body is useless. The Student Council should monitor such a representative to assure accountability to all student groups. Also, representation with no power is weak, so they should be allowed to vote. 8. A specific policy for AIDS victims is understandable because of the delicate nature of the situation. However, they should not be required to report their illness to the University Health Service in respect for their right to privacy."
66,Radtke's new profile takes him off guard,17 April 1986,"By M. KRYSTEN HOMMELRobert Radtke, CC '87, has been pleasantly surprised by his newfound recognition. ""I didn't think so many people would notice,"" the recipient of Time Magazine's College Achievement Award said recently. ""It's been nice."" An East Asian Studies major, 21-year-old Radtke is one of only 100 students nationwide to receive the honor. The award recognizes students for excellence in their field of interest. But in the case of this awardee, the criteria areespecially ambiguous. His interests are many and his record speaks for itself. ""I applied for the award based on my work for the Student's Committee on Coeducational Affairs,"" Radtke explained. Working withother students under Columbia College Assistant Dean of Students Karen Blank, Radtke helped bring the issue of sexual harrassment to the attention of the Columbia Community. The committee he led published the brochure ""Tell Someone"", which defines sexual harrassment, describes several of its manifestations and provides information on further resources for victims. ""Columbia's treatment of the subject has always been general,"" he said. ""We wanted to put together information that applied directly to our students, that students could read and see themselves in."" The brouchure was distributed to all Columbia College students last fall.But Radtke's interests extend beyond the work that helped distinguish his application from the 700 Time reviewed. He is also the co-founder of China House, a Special Interest Housing group that will spend its first year together in East Campus next fall. ""We were the only new Special Interest group accepted for next year,"" Radtke added, smiling. The group has already planned a number of movies, dinners, and special events to take them through December. Still, Radtke doesn't seem content to ""look forward"" to anything, if only because there's inevitably something lying between now and then.For example, when Radtke graduated from Milton Academy in Massachusetts in 1982, he decided college would not be his next step. ""I was looking for an experience other than being in school,"" he explained. ""I wanted an adventure, really."" Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities and Freshman Comp. not filling the bill, he deferred his acceptance to Columbia College and looked elsewhere. Interested in ""seeing the world before age 20,"" the Boston native took the advice of a family friend and applied to the Beijing Language Institute in China. He was accepted and spent the next nine months abroad, despite never having studied Chinese language or culture before. ""My parents were taken aback,"" he said matter-of-factly, ""but they supported my decision."" More recently, Radtke has embarked on a research project inspired by his work here at Columbia. With the help of Professor of Political Science Andrew Nathan, Radtke sub-mitted a proposal to the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] fora research grant. His proposal, entitled ""The Western Education of Chinese Intellectuals at Columbia University 1905-1930,"" has been accepted by the Younger Scholar Program, a division of the NEH. ""The grant is really for the summer,"" he explained, ""But I'll start working on it now."" His decision is not surprising in light of the fact that he will help lead a three-week tour through China this summer. The itinerary of the tour, which he organized with a friend, will include visits to several places that became favorites of his during his nine-month stay in the country. Radtke has not ruled out graduate school, nor a return to the East, ""to China or maybe Taiwan."" After further study, he said he envisions a career in public service. ""Still,"" he offered, in his soft-spoken manner, ""I'll probably just do nothing for awhile."""
67,Logic/rhetoric will replace composition,14 May 1986,"By ANDREA CHIPMANAll Columbia College first-year students will be required to take a new course in logic and rhetoric instead of one of the current freshman composition courses starting next year. The Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI) approved the course changes last month, according to Edward Tayler, professor of comparative literature and chair of the committee responsible for creating the new program.The new course will require students to hand in one threeparagraph essay for each class, as opposed to the 750 word essays now required weekly or less frequently for freshman composition. The course will also use some of the same materials covered in Core Curriculum classes like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Tayler said. He explained that students may be asked to analyse passages from Core texts, orwrite on ideas presented in them. ""We want to make it better by making it part of the Core Curriculum,"" he said. ""You do your thinking and writing in language. Language ought to be at the core of the Core. ""We're interested in writing skills, but we're trying to offer training that goes beyond,"" he said. All incoming students will be required to take the new course, which replaces present CIOO7 course inFreshman Composition, according to Director of Freshman Composition Carole Slade. Currently, around 40 students a year are exempted from CIOO7 and placed into the more ad-vanced 1011 course, and several are exempted entirely from the requirement, Slade said. Slade said the ClOll course will still exist as an elective for students who have already taken the new ""Logic and Rhetoric"" course, but that no students will be placed directly into ClOll. According to Tayler, 40 percent of first-year students are currently placed into CIOO4, a lower level composition course. While the format of that course will not change, the number of students placed into the course will be reduced. Students completing CIOO4 will then be required to take the logic and rhetoric course. According to Tayler the goal of the emphasison rhetoric and analysis is to force students to cut out the detours and filler often used in student composition papers. He expected that the shorter, more intensive assignments would compel students to put more thought and reflection into their papers. While the course will place a greater emphasis on argumentative structure, because students will be asked to write on subjects like humor-and irony in the course, Tayler said he did not think the new focus will limit the creative opportunities of the assignments. ""The idea is to give students more practice in writing, and the chance to get constant response to writing,"" Slade said. The course, which like the current composi-tion classes will be taught entirely by graduate students, will have a set agenda of topics to be examined, although individual assignments will be developed by each professor for his or her class. The agenda will be developed over the summer, and used on a trial basis year, according to Slade. Tayler said he does not foresee any problems arising from students with different writing abilities being placed in the same course. Students who might before have placed out of the CIOO7 course will be challenged by the ""Logic and Rhetoric"" course's focus on thinking, he said. The logic and rhetoric course would assume writing skills, and ""jack up theintellectual quotient,"" of the ClOll writing course, he said. According to Tayler, he developed the new course after he taught a Freshman Composition course to see how it functions. Along with Slade, he then designed ""Logic and Rhetoric"", and took the proposal to the COI. The process for the program's development was unique, he said. ""It flabbergasted the deans."" Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack praised both the proposal and the initiative that produced it. ""It's a great example of Columbia teachers taking their own initiative,"" he said. ""It will make the curriculum more coherent from section to section.""BUBBLE REPUTATION: There's nothing quite like a day when all there is to do is blow a few bubbles."
68,CC preceptors outraged by fellowship cuts,29 September 1986,"By JOSH GILETTE and STEPHEN WESTSome graduate and preceptors of Contemporary Civilization (CC) are threatening to withhold grades or strike after they learned last week they may not receive paid sabbaticals that they say they were promised two yers ago. A groups of preceptors decided at a meeting last week to send Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack and Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal a letter asking them to reinstate the fellowship program that gave preceptors who taught six consecutive semesters of CC or Literature Humanities a semester of paid sabbatical. Some preceptors said they would consider stronger action if the letter brought no response. ""We can get the senior faculty behind us, or we can strike or withhold grades,"" said preceptor Peter Judson, a history graduate student. ""Refusing to teach is a last resort."" But according to Columbia College administrators, chairs of departments involved in teaching CC wereinstructed in 1984 to tell their graduate students not to expect the grants.But those responsible in the history and philosophy departments said they were not aware that it was solely their responsibility to inform the preceptors about the stipend cut-off, and blamed the mix-up on poor communication with the Columbia College administration. Pollack said the school may makethe grants this year to avoid giving ""a nasty surprise"" to the 10 to 12 third-year preceptors currently affected by the decision. ""I am faced with a group of graduate preceptors who say their chairman never told them,"" he said. ""I may find myself actually obliged to keep a promise that I never made."" Rosenthal said administrators hope to decide this week whether the college can afford grants for the graduate students who thought they were to receive $4,300, their usual preceptor stipend, after teaching CC for three continuous years. The grants, part of the Chamberlain fellowship program, are still being offered to junior faculty members who teach Lit Hum and CC. Bu • ( 112 e p iwarr would definitely be cancelled for any graduate students who began teaching core curriculum classes after 1984. According to Pollack, College administrators decided to begin offering Chamberlains to graduatestudents in 1972, when they had difficulty finding instructors to teach core curriculum classes. The Chamberlains had been available for junior faculty since the 1950'5, as away of compensating them for diverting their attention away from their normal work. Preceptors hired to begin teaching CC in the fall of 1984 said they were told of the Chamberlain program in interviews with Rosenthal and Richard Brilliant, head of the CC program and were never told that Columbia College had decided to stop making the grants. ""I've now found out in my third year of teaching that I am not going to be getting what was explicitly discussed in my interview."" said CC preceptor Michael Sugrue, a history graduate student. Brilliant could not be reached for comment. According to Pollack, he decided to discontinue the grants to preceptors because he believes the money, which comes from Columbia College alumni donations should go to Columbia College students instead of students from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). ""I cannot take the money from my students,"" Pollack said. ""I cannot see the College paying them (the preceptors) to be graduate students."" He added that he may try to work out an agreement with GSAS to help pay the graduate students who thought they were promised the fellowships. The dispute over the Chamberlains also threatens to hurt the relationships between Columbia College administrators and departments with core curriculum preceptors. History department chair John Garraty said that if the 10 to 12 preceptors in the current dispute are not given the Chamberlain he would consider next year withholding the 12 to 15 preceptors his department usually sends to CC. Professor of History James Shenton said last Thursday that he had not heard of any changes in the Chamberlain program \ and considers the paid sabbatical an important attraction for the preceptors. ""I wouldn't recommend that my graduate student (advisees) take the position if there were no Chamberlains,"" he said. But Rosenthal said he does not expect the pool of preceptors to dry up now that the College has stopped offering the grants. ""I don't think the Chamberlain—which was always a nice thing—was ever the deciding factor,"" he said. ""Those students will still receive three years of support and three years of active involvment in a rich and interesting student body and curriculum."" Graduate students selected to teach CC are informed of theirappointment by the chair of the department in which they are doing graduate work. Rosenthal said department heads were informed in the spring of 1984 that the College might not offer the Chamberlains to newly hired preceptors. ""It (the letter) said the department chairman should make sure no one was taking the job with the expectation of getting a Chamberlain,"" Rosenthal said. Heads of several departments with CC graduate preceptors blamed the confusion on poor communication with Columbia College administrators. Philosophy Professor James Walsh, who advises his department's preceptors, said Rosenthal's letter did not explicitly say that newly hired preceptors would not receive Chamberlains. ""I think that Rosenthal thought it was implicit for any intelligent reader,"" Walsh said. ""I was not that intelligent. In my view it was Dean Rosenthal's responsibility, in his view it was mine."" Walsh said he recently sent a letter to philosophy department preceptors accepting ""some responsibility"" for the confusion. Rosenthal said he thought the letter was adequate notification and he added that Lit Hum preceptors apparently understood that they would not receive the grants. ""Half the world seems to know and half doesn't,"" he said. ""In hindsight a different procedure would have been appropriate. I thought that I had in fact done what was necessary."" Lit Hum head and English Professor James Mirollo said he had informed the English graduate students appointed to be Lit Hum preceptors that they would not receive Chamberlains and that preceptors from other departments had apparently heard from their departments. Miroilo explained that when Rosenthal's April 1984 letter was written, Columbia administrators did not think they would be able to offer the grants to graduate students. But because no final decision had been made, the letter did not explicitly rule out the possbility of Chamberlains for the preceptors, he added. Professor of History Ainslie Embree, Chair of History Department from 1982-85 s.iid he could not remember if he had informed new preceptors of the 1984 change in the Chamberlain program. He said that because any decisions concerning Chamberlains are madfc by the Columbia College administration, any discussion of the stipend would not occur on the departmental level.Robert Pollack"
69,CC preceptors to get paid leave,3 October 1986,"By STEPHEN WESTA group of graduate preceptors of Contemporary Civilization (CC) will receive the paid sabbaticals they say they were promised two years ago, although Columbia College Dean Robert Pollack said he is not yet certain where the $50,000 needed to pay them will come from. Pollack said Columbia College will pay for the preceptors' sabbaticals out of its own budget if the Planning and Budget Committee of the University's Arts and Sciences division, which is composed of Columbia College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) the School of International Affairs and the School of General Studies, refuses to fund the leaves from its joint budget. Pollack is arguing that while CC is a Columbia College-run program, because the sabbaticals help GSAS students finance their own educa-tions, both schools ought to fund them. Last week, a group of 10 to 12 third-year CC preceptors threatened to strike or withhold grades after learning they would not receive a semester of paid leave. The preceptors say they were told when they were-hired in 1984 that they would receive the sabbaticals if they taught three consecutive years of CC or Literature Humanities. But GSAS Dean Gillian Lindt, who serves on the Planning and Budget Committee along with Pollack, said she thinks Columbia College should individually fund the sabbaticals for the preceptors. ""My view would be that the college hires and fires, and that's where the responsibility should be,"" she said. In addition, Lindt questioned whether it is GSAS students' best interests to be teaching the time consuming core courses. ""I am not sure myself that I would give that reward [for teaching three years of core curriculum courses],"" she said. ""It extends the number of years that students have to take awayfrom their research and dissertations."" Professor of History James Shenton has said that he would not recommend that his advisees teach the core if they did not receive the sabbaticals.Columbia College administrators decided two years ago to eliminate the paid leave for graduate preceptors of CC and Lit Hum, and use the money for undergraduate financial aid. The heads of departments with graduate preceptors were told to inform them not to expect the sabbaticals, but some of the CC preceptors say they never received work of the change. The paid sabbaticals were part of the Chamberlain Fellowships, a program started 30 years ago to reward junior faculty who spent three consecutive years teaching Lit Hum or CC. Graduate preceptors, who now make $4,300 a semester for teaching the courses were added to the Chamberlain program in 1972, after Columbia College had difficulty finding instructors for the core curriculum. The grants, funded with alumni contributions, are still being offered to junior faculty who teach Lit Hum and CC. According to Pollack, Columbia Collegewill not fund paid sabbaticals for graduate preceptors hired after 1984, although he said GSAS or the planning and budget review committee might decide to continue funding the graduate Chamberlains. At a meeting last week, preceptors affected by the decision agreed to send a letter to Pollack asking for the restoration of the sabbaticals. But one of the preceptors said yesterday they had been told they would receive the semester of paid leave and are holding the letter until next week to give college administrators time to work out details for financing the sabbaticals. Lindt, however, said the graduate school could not afford to fund the program from its present financial aid budget. She suggested that the Columbia College and GSAS administrators agree to a joint fundraising drive to raise money from alumni for the sabbaticals."
70,New frosh comp gets mixed reviews,15 October 1986,"By JESSICA GOODHEARTIt is still known as 1007 in the vernacular of Columbia College students, but the descriptive title behind the course number has changed and, according to the organizer of the""the new 1007,"" so has the content of the course. But while Professor of English Edward Taylor, chair of the committee on freshman compostion, maintains that the shiff from ""Argumentative Writing"" to ""Logic and Rhetoric' is more than just rhetorical, some students say they have not yet seen real differences between the twocourses. According to Taylor, the content and philosophy of 1007 has been changed radically. Instead of a weekly 750-word paper, students have writing assignments due every class. Where the graduate teaching assistants who teach the course may have once used articles from Time magazine to demonstrate particular rhetorical methods, they are now encouraged to employ readings from Literature, Humanities and Contemporary Civilization to make their points. Furthermore, the dreaded 10page research paper that used to cap off a semester of Argumentative Writing has been eliminated in what Taylor called an effort to emphasize further writing over research. ""The logic is more vigorous, the rhetoric more persuasive,"" Taylor said. As the curriculum has been standardized between the different sections of the course, the number of sections has been increased. Taylor said the average class size has been reduced from 24 students to 12 in aneffort to create more of a workshop atmosphere. but some students who have taken both courses say there's little very difference between the two. Dancelle Campbell, CC'B9, is taking Logic and Rhetoric this year after having dropped it last year. While Campbell said she enjoys this year's class more because there is less lecturing involved and the smaller classes allow for greater class discussion, she said she has yet to locate the effects of the new emphasis on logic and rhetoric. ""They are acting like there are big changes going on, but it all boils down to two papers instead of one."" Amy Bardock, CC'B9, another second time 1007 student, questioned whether the increased work load is beneficial to students writing. ""You spend all your time thinking of topics and you have no time to write. It [the new 1007] is teaching me how to write a paper as fast as possible and not how to write."" The new couse, which Taylor is still quick to term experimental, comes as the result of a three-year long effort by Taylor to correct problems he discovered when he taught a section of Argumentative Writing three years ago. In past years nearly, half the entering students were required to complete more basic composistion course (1004) before they were allowed to take 1007. Taylor said the division of students into the two courses was often random and unnecessary. ""We were taking extremely bright kids and spending too much time teaching them mechanics,"" Taylor said. As a result of the changes, far less emphasis is placed on the teaching of grammar. ""There will be no more lecture on auxiliary verbs."" Taylor added. Instead, TAs will address gramatical problems as they arise in individual papers. While a few sectins of 1004 remain, placement is now determined by SAT scores rather than by an placement exam. Only students with verbal SAT scores below 500 are required to take 1004. Advanced Argumentative Writing (1011), the course into which a few students were placed into each year in lieu of 1007, now exists only as an elective tor those students who have already completed 1007. Taylor has also concentrated on standardizing the subject matter covered in the course. At weekly teachers' meetings, TAs discuss teaching methods and way of approaching the course. In an attempt to provide guidelines for teachers Taylor had drawn up a list of topics including the more straightforward rhetorical devices such as ""Comparison and Constrast,""""ldentification and Description"" and the more subtle aspects of writing including ""Irony and Wit,""and ""Bias and Usage,"" from which teachers make their own syllabi. The T.A.s are still allowed a great deal of freedom in handling the course, he said. Gary Hentzi, a T.A. who also taught 1007 last year, said notices ""much more unity among the staff"" now. Although his personal workload has increased because of the rwo paper a week minimum, he points out that class size has gone down. ""This is one of his best results of the change,""Hentzi said."
71,CC sabbatical Is OKed for current preceptors,21 January 1987,"By MELISSA MICHELSONAfter a semester-long controversy, the University's Arts and Sciences Planning and Budget Committee has granted a semester of paid sabbatical to graduate preceptors currently teaching core curriculum classes. However, the sabbaticals will not be offered to preceptors who begin teaching after this year. The paid sabbaticals were part of the Chamberlain Fellowships, a program started 30 years ago rewarding junior faculty who spend over three consecutive years teaching Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) or Contemporary Civilization (CC). Graduate preceptors, who now earn $4,300 a semester for teaching these courses were added to the Chamberlain program in 1972 after Columbia College had difficulty finding instructors for the core curriculum. The grants which fund thesemester of sabbatical will continue to be offered to junior faculty teaching Lit Hum and CC. Columbia College administrators decided two years ago to eliminate the sabbaticals for preceptors and use the money designated for that program for undergraduate financial aid. Preceptors protested the decision and threatened to withhold grades or strike if they did not receive the paid leave. Without the sabbaticals, preceptors predicted that the quality of teaching will decline as graduate students seek better positions. Many said the quality of the CC course will similarly decline, since over 50 percent of those classes are taught by preceptors. Peter Judson, a graduate history student who teaches CC, said, ""By ending the sabbaticals they are not going to attract the best people."" ""You don't come to Colmubia to be taught by graduate students. The College has to maintain its high standards,"" Judson added. ""The College can always get graduate students to teach the classes. What they won't necessarily get is good [graduate] students."" Dean of Columbia College RobertPollack said the quality of the core classes are a top priority. ""The core curriculum is important to the college and all schools in the arts and sciences, and because it is such, it has to be preserved and protected."" Pollack said, however, he believes the number of CC preceptors should be reduced from 50 percent to about onethird, similar to the percentage of preceptort teaching Lit Hum. According to Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka, it is currently difficult to find full professors to teach CC, and he predicts that the same high percentage of preceptors will continue teaching in the future. Lehecka said he feared that future teachers may be of poorer quality without the Chamberlains. ""This year they [the teachers] are less committed than 20 years ago,"" Lehecka said, adding that the absence of sabbaticals would mean a higher turnover rate for preceptors, giving them little chance to become as involved in the class as teachers of past decades. ""There are too many graduate students teaching CC,"" he added.But Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal said, ""I don't think it will have any appreciable effect. The benefits of teaching CC or Lit Hum are not to be found simply in the Chamberlain."" But Philosophy graduate preceptor Pierre Keller also predicted a problem with hiring in the future. ""As other positions open up, the college will have increasing difficulty getting the best people,"" he said. ""I do think it's important that the program be continued for the sake of coming years. It's in their own self-interest as well as for the students—not just the preceptors."" Graduate preceptor Michael Koessel also saw problems in the future of the CC program as a result of the discontinued sabbaticals. ""It's going to make it harder for the college to keep people for three years. Most of these people are inexperienced when they start. It takes time to learn to teach the material. When you're in only fora semester, you don't have time to put thatinto effect,"" he said. ""In the future people are going to take their own needs into account, and they're going to look harder for other means of support and work harder [on their dissertations] while they're teaching CC,"" Koessel said. Professor of Philosphy Arthur Danto, who also teaches CC, said he likes the idea of many graduate preceptors teaching CC. ""They bring something that often the older professors don't bring to CC, "" he said. ""They bring a lot of enthusiasm and a freshness."" Graduate history student John Recchiuti agreed that variety in the CC teaching staff should be welcomed. ""Otherwise you could just have one giant class with a TV screen and one senior professor,"" Recchiuti said. While Danto doubted that the preceptors would pass up teaching CC because of the discontinued sabbaticals, he did predict that the college will have to reinstate the Chamberlains or a similar program when the market for teachers dwindles in the 1990's as a bulk older faculty begin to reach retiring age."
72,Students organize to form cut-rate book co-op,21 January 1987,"By MILES POMPERA student book co-op that would sell and buy books at the beginning and end of each semester could be in Ferris Booth Hall by the end of this semester, according to Student Council Chair Alex Navab, CC '87. The council has been considering options fora book co-op since the beginning of the last semester. Navab said he hopes the temporary co-op could become a permanent bookstore in a few semesters. ""I want to have a book co-op by the end of the semester, and I think if people work on it, we can have one,"" Navab said. The book co-op is intended to sell academic books at reduced rates to compete with the retail rates at Barnes and Noble and Bookforum. Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka agreed that a limited book co-op will be a feasible option. ""This will get it started off and get the most accomplished with the least hassle,"" Lehecka said. To organize a more permanent student book co-op, Navab said he is planning to meet in the next week with several students interested in helping to establish a more perma-nent student book co-op. The group hopes to develop a definite plan that could be presented to University administrators by mid-February. Class president CC '90 Marc Seidenberg, class president CC '89 Jared Goldstein, Furnald Grocery Manager Jim McKnight, CC '87, David Keresztes, CC '89, Ajay Dubey, CC '89, and Kaivan Shakib, CC '89, the founder of a temporary book co-op held last year, will be organizing the new store. ""There's been a lot of misunderstandings with the administration and this will help clear them up,"" Goldstein said. However, disagreements persist regarding the future status of a permanent book co-op. While Lehecka favors a limited co-op in the future, most other students and administrators agree that they would prefer a year-round bookstore. ""The book co-op will easily outgrow the coat-check room (in FBH) and it will get bigger and better,"" Director of Student Activities Chuck Price said. Shakib said the Columbia Barnes and Noble Bookstore is concen-trating on selling students high quality books. ""I think it's easier to buy a sweatshirt at Barnes and Noble than a Lit Hum book,"" Shakib said. A temporary bookstore, Navab asserted, would be unable to attain the substantial bulk savings that would enable it to build up a capital base. ""It's hard to buy bulk books with a limited amount of funds,"" Navab said. The remaining problem facing the student bookstore is finding space on Columbia's crowded campus. Dubey, the vice-president of the temporary book co-op explained, ""Space is probably harder to find at Columbia than money."" McKnight said he believes a space adjacent to Furnald Grocery would be the best location for the book co-op. ' 'The need fora bookstore and the ability of Furnald Grocery to run it should override any problems,"" McKnight said. Shakib also cited Furnald Grocery as the best location fora student-owned bookstore, since it already has management, workers, and a capital base. ""I really would like to see it in Furnald Grocery, it would be the most practical place, ' Shakib said. Problems arose last year when Furnald Grocery's plans to sell used books out of its storage area had to be scrapped. Furnald employees took over storage space next to the grocery for the co-op last May, but maintenance moved the group back out the next day since University Residence Halls(URH) had not allocated the space for the grocery. URH later redecorated the space and made it a second lounge for Furnald residents Associate Director of Residence Halls Carolyn Smith said no spaces near Furnald Grocery could be used as new storage areas and that the administration was not sure that Furnald would be the best location fora bookstore because of the security problems it might create for the dormitory. McKnight said that if the bookstore is not located adjacent to the grocery it would be unlikely that Furnald would be willing to manage the store. Smith added that she did not think a dormitory would be the best place fora bookstore. ""If students living there have a need for that and don't oppose it and it would not jeopardize security or create problems, we would support it as much we can,"" Smith said. If no space in Furnald or another dormitory were available, Navab suggested that the first floor of FBH would be a good location. Price seemed to rule out this possibility, claiming that no spaces were available and that a permanent bookstore in that location would create serious security problems. ""Security-wise and otherwise there'd be a lot of problems with that area,"" Price said. Columbia College classes of 1989 and 1990 are also sponsoring book sales in FBH every day this week from noon to 6 p.m. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization texts are available at discounts of up to 20 percent charged at Barnes and Noble.SHAKE AND BAKE: The new book co-op may shake up Barnes and Noble."
73,Preceptors cite lax communication with CC for last semester's paid sabbatical brouhaha,9 February 1987,"By Melissa MichelsonPoor communication with the Columbia College administration is at the root of last semester's controversy over paid sabbaticals for graduate preceptors, some preceptors have charged. Columbia College administrators decided two years ago to eliminate the sabbaticals for preceptors, but preceptors hired since then complained they had never been inform-ed of the change in policy. Preceptors protested last semester by threatening to withhold grades or strike if they did not recieve the paid leave. Columbia College agreed to grant preceptors in their third year the paid sabbaticals, which are part of the Chamberlain Fellowships, a program that rewards junior faculty who spend over three consecutive years teaching Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization. Graduate preceptors were added to the Chamberlain program in 1972 after Columbia College had difficulty finding instructors for the core curriculum. According to graduate preceptor Peter Judson, there is no communication between the administration and the preceptors. ""The reason that whole thing happened is that no one communicated with anyone else,"" he said. Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal concededthat the controversy was due to a foul-up in communication, but called it an isolated incident. ""I trust there will be no more communication problems,"" he said. Graduate Preceptor Paul Spillenger said the real reason for the controversy is that graduate preceptors do not have a contract with the University. ""We don't have contracts so there's a lot of ambiguities in theagreements,"" he said. ""It would be nice to have a contract—a committment from the University. But who knows how hard it would be then become to get a preceptorship,"" he added. Judson, however, said the preceptors do have contracts, although they merely state the salary of the position but include no other information. Spillenger said that no communication problems currently exist between the administration and the preceptors. ""Speaking only from personal experience I never had any problems with communication with the administration,"" he said. Spillenger blamed the controversy on consummate injusticerather than a lack of communication. But graduate preceptor Simone Chambers also blamed the Chamberlain controversy on a lack of communication. ""I'm not even sure how it works, but the University pays the salary, although the College pays the Chamberlains. The College interviews you, but you're actually an employee of your department,"" Chambers said. And Graduate preceptor Michael Koessler complained that information about his job came entirely secondhand. ""It didn't come to us from the people who hired us,"" he said. ""It's not clear to me that we've had any access beyond the chairman, Richard Brilliant.""""All of this confusion could have been avoided if the people who were hiring us had been more explicit in terms of our contract,"" Koessler added. ""I would imagine in the future things will be done in writing or at least be very verbally explicit."" ""During the negotiations we spoke to Dean Pollack and he seemed open to more communication with the preceptors. He admitted that there was not enough of it."" Chambers added, ""The more communication the better."" Pollack would not comment on what he thought should be done or whether more communication with the preceptors was planned for the future.Michael Rosenthal"
74,Student disorganization delays Trilling prize,19 February 1987,"By Miles PomperThe Lionel Trilling Award honoring the year's most significant work by a Columbia professor, scheduled to be given last November, will not be announced until the end of April if it is announced at all this year, according to the student responsible for overseeing the awards. Ann Marie Vitek, CC'B7, chair of the Trilling/Van Doren Awards Committee, said the Trilling Award, named after the late Professor of English, an esteemed literature authority and a founder of the literature humanities course, will probably be announced by the end of this semester. However, she said it is still possible that no award at all will be given for the second year in a row. ""I'm almost certain there will be a Trilling Award this year,"" said Vitek, who is still recruiting students for the committee which will choose the award recipient. Other students, however, were less positive about the awards. ""The Trilling Award is not going to be given this year,"" Diane Hilal,CC'B7, the chair of the Academic Affairs Committee of the Columbia College Student Council, said. ""I think we're probably going to pull off one of the awards this year, probably just the Van Doren,"" agreed Student Council Chair Alex Navab, CC'B7. While the Trilling Award honors a professor's recent publication, the Mark Van Doren award, named after the popular Shakespearean scholar,honors teaching skills. The delays in naming a Trilling Award recipient stem from an episode of bureaucratic buck-passing this fall, according to Vitek. ""The question of whether the awards should be under the student council or the Board of Managers (BOM) delayed the awards for at least two months,"" Vitek said. Double Discovery Center DirectorGlenn Hopkins, who helped start the Trilling Award in 1976, said, ""I think it [the delays of the award] does a great disservice to all the faculty who have won it in the past and it does a great disservice to the memory of Lionel Trilling."" Diana Trilling, the widow of the late professor concurred. ""It's just a shame that this had to go into oblivion because nobody had the energy to bother."" This year BOM, which had been responsible for the awards until last year, decided it no longer wanted to manage the awards selection, so responsibility was given to the council, which then assigned it to its Academic Affairs Committee, according to Vitek. However, the committee chair, Hilal, was not present at the council meeting when the decision was made. When the academic affairs committee was notified, it said it could not handle the prizes because it had no prior experience in award giving and no time to organize a group to manage the project before the November deadline. ""What it came down to is the fact that we didn't know how to do it,"" Hilal said. The committee refused to take responsibility for the award, voting unanimously to send it back to the council in November. Finally, in January the task was reassigned to a subcommittee for the Trilling and Van Doren Awards under the council's Student Services Committee. Neither the BOM nor the council as a whole, nor the academic affairs committee would take responsibility for the delays in awarding the Trilling Award. BOM President Umer Sheikh, CC'B7, said his group chose not to award the prizes this year because of problems it had encountered with funding, a lack of student commitment to the awards, and because the awards do not benefit the entire undergraduate community but only those at Columbia College. Last year, Sheikh said the council rebuffed his request for funding for the Annual VanDoren Award Dinner at which the prize is awarded. Citing the dinner as too expensive for the number of students involved, the council cut the funding for the awards presentation from $4,000 to $1,500 fora wine-and-cheese cocktail event. Hopkins said the Trilling Award ceremonies needn't cost more than $500 so funding should not be a problem. Hopkins added, ""It's certainly a better use of the student activities fee than bicycling,"" referring to the recent student council controversy regarding an approximately $2,000 budget for the bicycling club's trip to Puerto Rico over spring break. But Sheikh said the council's cuts dampened the enthusiasm students had for the awards. ""It demoralized us a great deal because we'd worked all year and the funding wasn't there for the way we wanted to do it and the way it had been done before."" Sheikh also said BOM had a lot of difficulty in recruiting people for the awards committee last spring and this fall. ""We couldn't find people willing to read the two or three books to help judge the awards,'' Sheikh said. Hopkins, however, said this excuse is not reasonable. ""You read three books a week at Columbia, it shouldn't be difficult to read three books over the year,"" Hopkins said. In addition, Sheikh said BOM should not handle the awards at all because BOM is supposed to serve the entire undergraduate community and the award is usually limited to Columbia College liberal arts professors. Navab attributed the problem with the Trilling/Van Doren awards to poor communication. He said BOM was supposed to advise the affairs committee on handling the awards and if they had, perhaps the ad hoc committee would not have to be organized. ""There was a big communication problem between the council and its committee and its Board of Managers,"" Navab said. ""I think a lot of people were lazy and the Board of Managers didn't live up to their responsibility.""Lionel Trilling"
75,Bicentennial celebration to start with reflections,23 February 1987,"By Melissa MichelsonThe Charter Bicentennnial Celebration of Columbia College kicks off almost a year of planned events next week with an opening reception entitled ""Reflections on the College."" The reception will be held Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. in the East Wing of Ferris Booth Hall. Although Columbia College is actually 233 years old, this year marks the 200 th anniversary of the rechartering of Colmbia as an independent institution. 1987 also marks the 50th anniversary of the Literature Humanities curriculum and the graduation of the first fully co-educational Columbia class. According to Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack, who will speak at the reception, Columbia was the first non-sectarian, independent college in America. King's College was founded in 1754 by a royal charter of King George II of England. The American Revolution forced a suspension of classes in 1776, but the college reopened in 1784 under the name of Columbia. According to Bicentennial Event Coordinator Elizabeth Bothamley, Alexander Hamilton forced a bill through the New York State legislature on April 13, 1787, that established the colleges's independence by placing it under the control of its own trustees, including Alexander Hamilton. Highlights of this semester's bicentennial events include a celebrational concert on March 29 in Low Memorial Library. The performance will include the premier of Heraclitean Fire for String Quartet and String Orchestra, which was written specifically for the event by Assistant Professor of Music George Edwards. On April 10, a parade will march from Liberty Square, at Columbia's original site near Trinity Church to the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall street fora Convocation and Civic Celebration. A number of speakers including Mayor of New York City Ed Koch, will be on hand. Sunday, April 12, a Bicentennial Gala, hosted by Walter Cronkite, will be held in the MetropolitanOpera House at Lincoln Center. The evening will feature Tony Bennett, George Segal, Emanuel Ax, John Kander and Fred Ebb. A champagne reception for benefit ticket holders will be held following the performance. Tickets for the Bicentennial Gala range from $10 for students to $25-$ 125 for general admissions. Benefit tickets range from $250 to $1,000. According to Pollack, the high prices are for alumni that understand they are paying for both scholarships and the event. He added that no Columbia money was budgeted for the Gala.According to Pollack, this year's events are designed after those of the Centennial Celebration in 1887. ""What we're doing is what was done 100 years ago,"" he said. President of the Senior Class Hannah Jones, CC'B7, said that Columbia's being the first college chartered without religious affiliations made the celebration most significant for her. ""It was an assertion of independence,"" she said. ""I think of Columbia as being a very independent place fall of independent people."" Bothamley said, ""This charter was like our declaration of independence."" According to Pollack, Anthony Lewis, a columnist for the New York Times, will speak at this year's graduation on how the college has benefited from going coeducational, as well as the Charter history.Robert Pollack"
76,Volunteers remain scarce for troubled Trilling prize,25 February 1987,"By Ann-Marie WongSamIf enough students can be solicited to serve on committees to select the professors most deserving of the awards for teaching skills and a recent and significant publication, the Van Doren and Trilling awards might be presented this April. The Lionel Trilling Award, which is named after the late Professor of English, an esteemed literature authority and founder of the Literature Humanities course, has not been awarded in close to two years. The Mark Van Doren award,named after the popular Shakespeare scholar, was awarded last year but does not necessarily require the students to do extensive research of a professor's published works. The Trilling award was scheduled to be given last November, but the Board of Managers (BOM), the Columbia College Student Council, and the Academic Affairs Committee all shirked responsibility in selecting the award recipient. Finally, the council created an ad-hoc committee, headed by Ann Marie Vitek, CC '87, to award the two prizes. According to Columbia College Student Council At-Large Representative Jodi Wu, CC '88, five students will be needed for the Trilling awards committee, and about eight students will be needed for the Van Doren awards committee. Wu said that the nine member Trilling award committee would consist fo five undergraduates in Columbia College, two professors, one representative of the English department, and one alumnus in the publishing industry. ""We have only two students on the committee already and Professor James Shenton has consented to be on the committee."" Wu said that there will be one undergraduate majoring in English, one undergraduate majoring in a remoteness of English, a general representative of Columbia College's student body, and possibly another Student Council member. ""The rules for selecting committee members have to be modified,"" Wu said. The council now handling the awards must decide whether to allow a council member on the awards committee, Wu said. She said that she will also be asking the council at next Monday night's meeting for approximately $3,100 for each of the award receptions, which is an approximation of last year's cost.""A lot will depend on how much money the committee has to work with,"" she said. Vitek said she was having trouble finding an alumnus from the publishing industry toserve on the committee. Vitek said she had found four names from Associate Dean of Columbia College Michale Rosenthal's office of alumni in the publishing industry and had sent letters asking them to be on the committee, but she has not yet received any replies. Vitek said that there have been few restrictions for potential applicants for the committee. ""Basically it's been who ever approaches me and wants to be on the committee. There aren't 50 people wanting to be on the committee,"" Vitek said. However, Vitek and Wu could not agree on the number of students on the Trilling committee. Wu seemed to think there were nine while Vitek said ten. Vitek added, ""There are ten positions on the committee that have to be filled. I have eight of the ten people."" Vitek said there were ten books from the social sciences that members would have to read. ""Some books have to be read more carefully than others. One book may be read [in its entirety] and others may be skimmed."" The books were published between January 1985 and December 1986, she said. Vitek objected to statements made in last week's Spectator by Double Discovery Center Director Glenn Hopkins, who helped to start the Trilling award in 1976. ""Glenn Hopkins made a statement that the awards shouldn't cost more than $500. Ten years ago, when he used to do it, he was asking for $800,"" she said. ""The plaque costs $300."" According to Wu, flyers will go up after spring break soliciting nominations from students for the Van Doren teaching award andsoliciting students to be on the award committee. Vitek said the number of students on that committee should range from about eight to ten. In order to nominate a professor for the Van Doren award, students will have to submit a one-page essay giving their reasons why the professor should receive the award. Vitek said that about ten to fifteen nominations will probably be submitted. ""Some are repeat nominations and some of the nominations have already won and have to be excluded."""
77,Philosophy for its own sake Comment In defense of Contemporary Civilization,16 April 1987,"CommentIn defense of Contemporary CivilizationSpectator columnist Jared Goldstein has recently made his ""Open session"" column a vehicle for some serious criticisms of the Contemporary Civilization requirement in Columbia College. While it would be ludicrous to deny his assertion that ""Columbia's core (curriculum) is missing something,"" it seems to me that several of his charges against CC deserve more careful consideration than he gives them. To begin with, Goldstein states that, ""If Contemporary Civilization can't even change the way a freshman looks at his own life, it certainly isn't going to produce citizens prepared to solve conflicts peacefully. And it certainly isn't going to change the world."" Notwithstanding his false conclusion that CC exists today for the same purposes as it didwhen it was created in 1919, Goldstein seems to have very strange expectations fora college course. Change the world? Perhaps a realistic goal fora seminar in conflict mediation, but not fora basic introduction to Western political philosophy. Philosophy is not some kind of magic wand, as Goldstein seems to believe—a handy tool for uncovering Truth and making it readily applicable to all the world's complex problems. On the contrary, philosophy is no more than a tentative attempt to construct a logical system of values and structures that allows us to more conveniently understand a vast influx of sensations and experiences. This ""convenience of understanding,"" though not as romantic an idea as absolute truth, should not be underestimated as the central aim of philosophy; all of philosophy's other purposes, including the improvement of existing political systems, are merely secondary applications. This distinction is significant when one considers the role of a philosophy requirement in an undergraduate curriculum. If the instant improvement of our lives and society is CC's raison d'etre, then the subject matter of the course is exposed to a greater danger: the trivialization of philosophy. Mill, Nietzsche, and Hegel will be studied not for their own sakes— just because they represent pinnacles of thought in the history of ideas—but only for what tidbits we can forcibly extract from their writings that will tangentially relate to our desire to concoct a new and ideal society. This immature approach to philosophy, as if it were some sort of political first-aid kit, is actually quite widespread. A friend of mine in the engineering school who happens to be a born-again Christian often remarks that she feels no need to take CC, because she ""already knows the truth."" Her notion is almost charming: the idea that CC is a survey of different thinkers' attempts to figure out The Answer to everything. Still, I suspect that the authors on the CC reading list would have been the first to disavow this mistaken view of philosophy. Of course, by defending philosophy's self-sufficiency, I open myself to the possibility of being criticized for supporting irrelevance in CC. I do no such thing. Nothing is more discouraging to students than an obtuse professor whose discussions are consistently suspended in an ozone layer of incomprehensibility. To render philosophy unintelligible byburdening it with obscure linguistics and overintellectualized but hardly illuminating ""concepts"" is as much a disservice to students as the oversimplification of complex ideas. But if CC is really producing ""too many complacent burgeoisie, content merely to memorize general terms to throw around at cocktail parties,"" as Goldstein claims, then a watering-down of its subject matter would hardly alleviate this problem. Goldstein cites other shortcomings as well. ""How can anyone squeeze 2,400 years of political thought into two semesters?"" he asks. ""The material is so rushed that during the final examination, all students can do is regurgitate basic slogans and ideas that span the centuries."" What I would ask Goldstein is this: how can you comfortably cram 2,400 years of political thought into four semesters? Even six? And for what course is the final exam any more comprehensive and substantial? No matter how much time we allot fora philosophy survey course, it is bound to be criticized as insufficient. How could it be otherwise? A general liberal-arts education lasts for four years. Whatever courses a student chooses in those four short years must necessarily be somewhat superficial. That is the fundamental trade-off of a broad education such as Columbia's: our college values both breadth and depth of knowledge, but it consciously gives preference to the former because it intends only to provide a foundation for further thinking and learning. Not fora moment does Columbia pretend that CC will make philosophical experts of us all, and those who believe that it is supposed to are severely abusing the privilege of a solid liberal-arts education. Goldstein presents another reason for the expansion of CC: its current exclusion of all non-Western philosophy. This is a more difficult charge to counter, as there is indeed little justification for educational narrow-mindedness in an increasingly interdependent and culturally heterogeneous society. But again, the question here is one of degree. How all-inclusive should CC become? It is, after all, a course being taught in a Western country most heavily influenced by Western political thought—and in just two semesters! If we do decide to make the CC syllabus more globally representative, there is yet another potential pitfall. When redesigning the syllabus, anidealistic curriculum committee, trying to act on Goldstein's advice, might treat the cultural variety of the reading list as a higher priority than the actual significance of each philosopher in the history of global political thought. In the same way that some affirmative-action quotas are an unjustifiable overcompensation for past racial discrimination, an overly conscious eclecticism in CC at the expense of true educational significance is no solution at all to ""reading-list racism."" We must be extremely careful in renovating CC to insure that the few philosophers included on the syllabus are truly the most important in the history of philosophy, and not merely concessions to cultural tokenism. In my opinion, this probably can't be done adequately with only two semesters. I agree with Goldstein that a reform of CC is called for, but I am not yet convinced that merely lengthening the course to four semesters will solve the other problems that need to be addressed. Goldstein's proposal for a better treatment (and better screening, I might add) of CC professors is entirely reasonable, as is his suggestion that a more positively oriented involvement of students be encouraged. If CC is expanded—even if it is not, actually—then the remoteness requirement at Columbia College should be eliminated. This ""remnant"" of the bygone second year of CC is nothing short of superfluous and unnecessary. Every science major at Columbia already has to take CC and Literature Humanities, and every humanities student already has to take a required year of sciences. There is no need for this additional measure to ensure that students take courses outside of their eventual field of study: they already do. But I insist that CC should not be shortened or devoted even in part to ' 'thought experiments"" such as the collective creation of a ""new society,"" as Goldstein suggests. The pride and distinction of Columbia's Contemporary Civilization course is that it forces students to directly confront the original texts. Other colleges are content simply to feed their students diluted versions of philosophical masterpieces via shallow textbook summaries. While CC may have its myriad of problems, at least it exposes us to the philosophers themselves. Without that, CC would truly become nothing more than Cocktail Conversation.Paul Meloccaro is a Columbia College sophomore.Because I said so Paul Meloccaro"
78,Lit Hum's 50th anniversary celebrated at annual dean's day,27 April 1987,"By Melissa Michelson""The way we do the course is the real secret of the success of the Humanities A program,"" English Department Chair James Mirollo said at the Dean's Day gathering of over 800 students and alumni on Saturday for the fiftieth anniversary of the Literature Humanities program. According to Alumni Affairs Director Jack Murray, over 30,000 people have taken the course since it was established in 1937. Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack spoke about the humanities program and how it affects students. ""As some of you know, in this decade Columbia College's treatment of Literature Humanities has expanded and tends to broaden the interpretation of texts,"" he said. ""The state at Columbia College is one of robust health,"" he said. ""The best way I know of to tell you about this is when my wife Amy and I went to the varsity show and I cannot remember the melody, but there was one rhyme that made the rhyme of Augustine and Larry Wein. I guess that's the state of Columbia College."" Mirollo spoke on the history of Humanities 'A.' ""Whatever else we may say of the course, we must never forget that it is our students who are the ultimate judge of its value,"" he said. ""To all accounts they have loved it."" ""In the fall of 1937, the urging question must have been,will it work,"" Mirollo said, adding, ""The planners seemed to be a bit too optimistic about the amound ot reading the students could do."" ""We are, as were our predecesors, committed to orchestrating in the two hours alloted us, an exciting and creative flow of conversation, which often involves shutting ourselves up,"" he said. Mirollo also spoke about the mix of faculty and grauduate preceptors that teach the course. ""The course badly needs experience and the wisdom that experience brings, [but sometimes] we are not able to borrow as many senior professors as we would like,"" he said. ""[However], the staff needs a mix."" Mirollo also illustrated how the syllabus of the course has changed over the years. ""A total of 130 books have been read in Humanities A over the last 50 years,"" he said. ""There has never been a concrete list that has been read every year."" According to Mirollo, this year some books written by black authors are being read as professors' choice, but the department has not decided to include black authors on the curriculum, although it has been discussed. ""The large question for the future is whether the course is worth preserving, and, if so, what purpose can it be expected to serve and in what form,"" Mirollo said. ""It is an ideal placeto make a statement or make a change."" ""[The books] have important things to say to us about ourselves and to other members of our planet,"" he said. Following the speeches, ten separate lectures were held on the texts. Assistant Professor of Classics Laura Slatkin spoke about Homer's Odyssey to about 150 alumni and students. ""The task for us is not only to show how modern it [the Odyssey] is, which it is, but also how distinctively Greek it is,"" Slatkin said. ""It is an integral paradox of the Odyssey that war both destroys and constitutes civilization."" Assistant Professor of English David Damrosch lectured on Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Euripides' Medea to approximately 150 alumni and students. ""The current state of the Humanities course involves a certain degree of working against its own traditions,"" he said. ""As it always is in Humanities, the question is, how the dialogues we set up with these texts alters our views of these texts."""
79,Protests rain on Bicentennial parade,13 May 1987,"By Melissa MichelsonFrom Wall Street to Lincoln Center, Columbia College students, faculty, administrators, and alumni painted the town blue this semester in celebration of the school's charter bicentennial. Although Columbia was founded as King's College in 1754 and actually blew out the birthday candles 33 years ago, the school did not receive an independent charter until April 13, 1787. This spring's festivities marked the 200 th anniversary of the passage of that charter by the New York State Legislature, making Columbia fully independent and under the control of its trustees. However, in celebrating the past, revelers did not escape the problems of today. Members of the community tenants' group, Housing For All (HFA), and the anti-racism ad-hoc organization, Concerned Black Students at Columbia (CBSC), staged several protests amidst the semester's events. Columbia College Dean Robert Pollack kicked off the bicentennial at a ceremony in February. At the close of the speeches, about 40 HFA demonstrators entered the room and began to chant ""Shame"" in protest of the eviction of former Columbia tenant Susana AcostaJaafar. The audience took little notice of the protestors and passed them by to attend a reception in an adjacent room. Even the fun-filled weekend of April 10th, which capped off the bicentennial celebration, was marred by protests. The weekend included a parade, a convocation, a civic celebration at Federal Hall, as well as a gala at the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. * Over 500 students, alumni, faculty and administrators gathered at Liberty Square in lower Manhattan Friday April 10 to parade up to Federal Hall after travelling downtown via the ""Columbia Express,"" a Columbia-only subway train decorated with Columbia memorabilia for the bicentennial. Members of CBSC also rode the ""Columbia Express,"" replacing official banners with their own, sing-ing 'We who believe in freedom cannot rest,"" and converting bicentennial placards into protest signs such as ""Racism is still killing us after 400 years. What's there to celebrate?"" The CBSC members 'uilowed the parade and chanted during most of the convocation condemning the university for fostering racism. One prominent speaker at the convocation was New York City Mayor Edward Koch, who read a proclamation making April 10, 1987 Columbia College Charter Bicentennial Day in New York City. The Metropolitan Opera House was sold out for the bicentennial gala on Sunday April 12 which featured Walter Cronkite as master of ceremonies as well as performances by singer Tony Bennett, actor and singer Ben Vereen, actor George Segal, CC '55, pianist Emmanuel Ax, CC '70, composer Marvin Hamlisch, and the Dance Theatre ofHarlem. Cronkite read a letter from President Ronald Reagan expressing his regret at not being able to attend the gala but wishing Columbia luck for the future. Preceding the bicentennial gala, however, HFA and CBSC members gathered outside the Metropolitan Opera House displaying protest signs and distributing leaflets, despite continued warnings of Lincoln Center security guards that they were not allowed to hand out leaflets. During intermission, four HFA members displayed signs in the lobby protesting Columbia's housing policies, which they claimed are racist, and were quickly ushered out of the building. But the protesting went by with little notice and the following Monday, the celebration continued with an academic convocation in St. Paul's Chapel celebrating the exact date of the bicentennial and the history of St. Paul's Chapel during those 200 years. A special Bicentennial Dean's Day was held April 25, which marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Literature Humanities program. Also in April, an exhibit of Columbiana historical objects opened in the Low Library Rotunda, including such Columbia memorabilia as William Samuel Johnson's rhinestone shoe buckles, an 1818 Park Place Campus Plate, and one of the four guns from the fateful duel between Aaron Burr and Columbia alumnus Alexander Hamilton on July 11,1804 that fatally wounded Hamilton. According to Bicentennial Event Coordinator Elizabeth Bothamley, a few more events are planned for next semester but the majority of the celebration is over. ""Those were the main events. We hope to have the banner hanging up on 116 th St.and Broadway through December,"" she said. Bothamley added that a closing ceremony might also be held towards the close of the year."
80,Lit Hum cheating scam may lead to firings,13 May 1987,"By Melissa MichelsonA majority of the more than 1,000 undergraduates who took the Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) final may have had the questions prior to the examination, according to students and Lit Hum Chair James Mirollo. At least one graduate preceptor may have released the contents of the examination, which were posted anddistributed througout campus dormitories. « Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Jon Anderson, the one preceptor identified by his students as having released the examination, discussed the final exam questions for over an hour in class both this and last semester, according to his students. Anderson said he on-ly discussed class themes. Other students have told Spectator that their preceptors also released the examination questions, but refused to reveal the names of their instructors. At the time of the interview, Mirollo said he did not know who distributed the exam, but said if a preceptor had done so, he would be fired.""We go through a lot of trouble to keep the confidentiality of the test,"" Mirollo said. ""The most you are allowed to do is go over old exams."" ""It was more than disappointing to have the year end on a sleazy note,"" he said. According to Jamie Stathatos, CC '90, a student in Anderson's class, Anderson told the class which books to study and which books would not be included in the quoteidentification section of the exams, both this semester and last semester. ""We didn't have the test,"" Stathatos said. ""He gave us strong hints."" Another student in the class, who asked that his name be withheld, said Anderson was holding copy of the final exam and looking at it while he discussed exam questions with students and told them how to approach the questions and which books would be appropriate for certain questions. ' 'He got the test and brought it out and went over it with us,"" he said. ""They [the questions] were given out to us with the idea that they were for us and we weren't supposed to run around and give them out."" According to Stathatos, his floor counselor, Dick Dawson, CC '87, suggested posting the information about the exams on a wall in Carman so other Lit Hum students could see it. Dawson refused to comment. Associate Dean of students Karen Blank and Assistant Dean of Residence Halls Tracey Stewart bothsaid they knew of no disciplinary action brought against Dawson. Stathatos said he let Dawson post the questions because he knew other students in Anderson's class were also sharing the information. Anderson maintained that he did not distribute the questions but reviewed themes with his students. ""I tell them what to look for. I tell them what to be thinking about. I don't tell them the questions. That's somewhat different,"" Anderson said. ""It has no effect at all because you still have to come up with the answers. Having the questions doesn't really help,"" Anderson said. Columbia College deans have said that although they do not know how many students saw the summary of the Lit Hum exam posted around campus, a new exam will not be administered. ""If it were an objectively graded exam with a curve, it would be another thing. I don't think there are any grounds for reschedulingan entire examination for 1,000 people,"" Columbia College Associated Dean Michael Rosenthal said. Rosenthal said Lit Hum instructors will be responsible for grading the exams with the knowledge that many students knew the questions in advance. Anderson added that he also thought the exam would not be rescheduled. ""I assume it's going to just ride,"" he said. Anderson maintained that he did not distribute the questions but reviewed themes with his students. ""I tell them what to look for. I tell them what to be thinking about. I don't tell them the questions. That's somewhat different,"" Anderson said. ""It has no effect at all because you still have to come up with the answers. Having the questions doesn't really help,"" Anderson said. Mirollo also said he thinks students who had the questions before the exam will not be atany advantage. ""We happen to have given the most difficult test that we've given in years,"" he said. ""I told all of the instructors [before this semester's exam] that the questions were out and they all thought it didn't make any difference,"" Mirollo said. Anderson added that he also thought the exam would not be rescheduled. ""I assume it's going to just ride,"" he said. Students from other Lit Hum classes said their instructors mentioned that the questions were well-known and even changed the exam accordingly. Michael Kudler, CC '90, said his Lit Hum instructor gave a supplementary exam and told students the standardized exam would not weigh as heavily in the final grading. Another student, who asked not to be identified, said his Lit Hum instructor gave alternate questions, but told students they had the choice of the two sets of questions."
81,No action to be taken against Lit Hum profs,3 June 1987,"By Jodi PulverNo disciplinary action will be taken against preceptors who revealed the topics of the departmental Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) final examination to their students, according to Columbia Colege Associate Dean Michael Rosenthal. Over half of the 1,000 undergraduate students taking the required course may have known the topics and some of the questionscovered in the May examination. A copy of questions that were supposed to be on the exam was posted on the third floor of Carman Hall. Following revelations that exam topics were widely distributed among the student body, Lit Hum Department Chair James Mirollo said that he would fire any teacher he found to have given out the exam. However, according to Mirollo, students didn't actually have the questions that appeared on the examination. He said that he had determined that students were just given guidelines of topics that might be asked on the test. ""We discovered that several instructors had inadvertently, indiscreetly told students what some of the topics would be, but none actually had the exam, which I think was suggested in the previous (May 13) Spectator article,"" Mirollo said. ""If the exam was actually given out, I would have fired [the faculty member who distributed it],"" he added. However, according to several students, the essay questions thatwere revealed to them before the exam were nearly identical to those on the actual examination. Rosenthal said that the preceptors had erred in their methods of reviewing for the examination. ""Several people in reviewing the kinds of questions [on the exam] seem to have perhaps been too detailed."" Mirollo and Rosenthal both said that a discussion of the incident and the preceptors' actions would suffice in preventing a recurrence in the future. ""[The preceptors who revealed questions on the exam] were verbally reprimanded, and are on notice that this can't happen again. They've been properly shocked, surprised and humiliated enough,"" Mirollo said. According to Mirollo, three preceptors approached him following the exam, to discuss whether their methods of reviewing for the test were in violation of the department's regulations. Mirollo said he privately discussed the matter with each instructor and told them they had discussed the material on the exam in further depth than University rules allow. Mirollo refused to reveal the names of any preceptors who might have given out exam topics. Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Jon Anderson was the one preceptor identified by several students as releasing information about the final examination to his class. According to Anderson, he did ""what most professors do"" in reviewing for the Lit Hum exam with their classes. ""If you go over the basic themes of the course, you've got the themes of the exam,"" he added. ""It has no effect at all,"" Anderson said,""because you still have to come up with the answers. Hearing the questions doesn't really help."" One student in Anderson's class, who asked that his name be withheld, said that Anderson was holding a copy of the final exam and looking at it while he discussed the questions, told them how to approach the questions, and detailed which books would be appropriate for certain questions. Anderson denied those allegations and maintained that he merely reviewed the themes of the course. ""I tell them what to look for,""he said. ""I tell them what to be thinking about. I don't tell them the questions. That's somewhat different."" Anderson said he told his students there wouldn't be any emphasis on the Bible on the exam since the midterm had dealt with those topics sufficiently. He admitted, however, that by narrowing down a large array of topics, he may have accidentally breached University rules. ""Insofar as I gave them that information, I transgressed College rules,"" he said ""But everyone on the staff does it,""he added. Mirollo said strict security rules are enforced to prevent the leakage of examination material. He said the depatmental exam, which is prepared by a committee of three faculty members, is photocopied, and numbered copies are distributed to each member of the Lit Hum department to vote upon. Subsequently, each exam is collected and stored by security. Mirollo said the coDies do not becomeavailable until half an hour before the actual exam. Mirollo said that the whole process of numbering, recalling, and storing the exams should have sent an unspoken message to preceptors that the exam must be confidential. ""The most [an instructor] may do is go over old exams to familiarize the students with the format,"" Mirollo said. ""But nothing of the exam may be discussed."" Although Anderson was a member of the Lit Hum exam committee this year, he denied that he used information he had about the test to reveal specific questions to his students. ""I'm hardly the one who's going to sabotage the exam,"" he said. According to Mirollo, knowledge of the topics prior to the examination did not prove to be beneficial to students, and might have actually been detrimental to students' performances on the exam. ""It didn't help students at all to have the topics. Six out of eight [questions] were from old exams anyway,"" he said. Anderson agreed that students who obtained information about the exam were not at an advantage. He said that information about the exam that was posted in Carman was ""meaningless drivel."" ""The damn thing is inaccurate as well,"" he said. ""Whatever did get out was an advantage to absolutely no one."" Anderson added that there was no significant discrepancy in the grades of students in his class on the final, as compared to their performance during the year. ""My students did their usual work,"" hesaid. ""My 'A' students did 'A' work, my 'B' students did 'B' work."" According to Mirollo, the incident was unfortunate, but had occurred ""out of love and not malice."" There's a fine line between helping students and breaching security rules,"" he said. According to Mirollo, a letter concerning the incident and the prevention of a recurrence is being sent to all members of the Lit Hum faculty. Mirollo said that an assembly of the faculty to review the rules and regulations is scheduled for September 3.Michael Rosenthal"
82,CC preceptor dies of AIDS Endowment fund planned in memoriam,3 June 1987,"Endowment fund planned in memoriamBy Tracy ConnorContemporary Civilization (CC) and philosophy department preceptor, Bruce Phillip Cooper, CC '77 died of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) on May 11, according to Executive Director of theCapital Campaign Susan Hendrix. An endowment fund in Cooper's name is being established by the University but is still in the process of being arranged with Cooper's family, Hendrix said. She added that before his death Cooper requested that any fund be used to benefit the Columbia College core curriculum program and its faculty. After attending Columbia College from 1973 to 1977, Cooper also attended the School of International and Public Affairs and received an M.B.A. from Columbia Business School in 1979. Cooper worked as a preceptor from 1985 until last semester; A friend of Cooper's, Cathy Nepomynaschny, a former preceptor in the Literature Humanities department, said that Cooper hoped any endowment money would be used to create another class section in the Contemporary Civilization department. Nepomynaschny said Cooper planned to teach last semester, but was too ill. She said he was nearly finished working on his dissertation when he died. A memorial service was held for Cooper last week in Philosophy Hall, and the Columbia flag was flown at half mast. According to Hendrix, the minimum total contribution neededfora memorial fund is $25,000. The Bruce P. Cooper fund will be the second instituted at Columbia in memoriam of a student who died of AIDS. A memorial fund was started last fall honoring Stuart Garcia, CC '84, who died last July of AIDS. The purpose of the Stuart Garcia fund is to help maintain need-blind admissions, a financial aid program which Garcia fought vigorously to maintain as a representative to the University Senate, during his junior and senior years. Cooper and Garcia are as yet the only two Columbia affiliates to have died of AIDS, according to University public statements. A University AIDS committee, headed by Senior Vice President Joseph Mullinix and designed to examine the problem of AIDS on campus and to develop a University policy on the illness, began meetings over two years ago. Last year the committee released a pamphlet to the University community detailing the illness and medical facts about how it is contracted. No University policy, however, has yet been composed.

83,Student-run book co-op opens today,8 September 1987,"By Maria NievesUnder new management and boasting a full stock of books, the Columbia College Book co-op will re-open today in Ferris Booth Hall to thrifty student shoppers. Previously organized by the classes of '89 and '90, the co-op was taken over by the Columbia College Student Council this year to simplify its financial operations, according to Kaivan Shakib, council member andco-organizer. ""We were using the freshman and sophomore classes to order the books through and to put the money in,"" Shakib said. ""But it's a little bit easier to keep track of the money going in and out and we also don't have to go through the class presidents for anything like petty cash."" The co-op will operate out of 106 FBH for two weeks, offeringLiterature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization books at prices 15 percent lower than those of Barnes and Noble Bookstore, Shakib said. Last year, book shortages led coop managers to take reservations and deposits for books not yet received from publishers, Shakib said. ""This year we're okay,"" he said. ""For once we're going to have all the books here. Last year, we didn't do the ordering in advance enough.'' Co-op Manager Matthew Lazen, CC '89, said this year's co-op will have up to 80 copies of each book. ""This thing [the co-op] should be really great this year because we've set up so many more accounts with publishers,"" Lazen said. Shakib said he hopes to expand the co-op's stock as soon as next semester if this operation is sue-cessful. ""If everything goes well, we'll go into the science and math books. We don't get as much of a profit on those,"" he said. Lazen said he also hopes to expand the stock to include stationary and t-shirts. ""The University has very little space, but once we do get some we'd like to make it the ultimate bookstore."" Shakib said he is also hoping for work-study status for co-op volunteers next semester. Presently, any volunteers who put in six hoursat""the co-op will receive their books at cost. ""We're hurting for volunteers,"" Shakib said. Organizers said they are optimistic that student response to the co-op will be positive. ""Judging from the response we got last time, when the publicity wasn't that good, I think this year the response will be overwhelming,"" said council liaison Dave Kerestyes, CC '89. According to Shakib, profits generated by the co-op will be used to buy stationery lor co-op advertisements, and to pay phone bills.SETTLING IN: The class of 1991 has carried its boxes, cruised Manhattan via the Circle Line and generally carried on this week.

84,Rush on book co-op empties store's stock,10 September 1987,"By Melissa MichelsonTen hours and thousands of books later, the Columbia College Book Co-op closed for the semester yesterday with 100 books left in stock, according to co-organizer and Columbia College Student Council member Kaivan Shakib. ""The demand was just phenomenal,"" Shakib said. ""We have a few books left of three titles, but it's not worth it to stay open."" The co-op was scheduled to remain open for two weeks this semester, offering Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization books to students at prices up to 15 percent less than those of Barnes and Noble Bookstore. Founded by the classes of '89 and'90 last year, the co-op was taken over by the student council to simplify financial operations, Shakib said. Shakib said twice as many books and co-op stationary will be ordered for next semester. ""We're also looking into using the pool room as a permanent place for the book co-op and the credit union,"" he said. ""It's just the beginning of the year. We haven't really put that into motion yet."" Permanent space for both the book co-op and the credit union has been repeatedly denied by the University. Temporary space in room 106 of Ferris Booth Hall was granted for the co-op this year and last year."
85,English gets new profs; but it still needs more,17 September 1987,"By Ann-Marie WongSamFaced with the prospect of a growing undergraduate community clamoring to be English majors, the English Department this summer hired two new professors and seven new assistant professors. But last spring, when the Arts and Sciences Planning and Budget Committee (P & B) authorized the hiring of the nine faculty members, some professors and students complained that they would not be enough to reduce the size of overcrowded lecture courses and increase the number of undergraduate seminar offerings. In addition, according to Department Vice-Chair Robert Hanning, four of the seven new assistant professors will be replacements for members who have left thedepartment. ""I guess three could be called additional,"" Hanning said. Hanning said he regarded the authorization from the P & B to hire the new assistant professors as a positive sign. ""Just in the last year we have started building back up. We have the hope of more appointments at the junior level. This modest expansion represents a commitment on the part of the administration to strengthening the department,"" Hanning said. Cutbacks were made in the department throughout the 1970's when financial constraints required limitations of the University faculties. Many non-tenured faculty memberswere dismissed and there was a hiring freeze. Department Chair Steven Marcus said the English Department hopes to recruit more full professors as well. ""We're going to go on appointing new people,"" Marcus said. Marcus said the expansion of the English Department will have to be moderate and methodical. ""You cannot suddenly increase the number of people out of the blue sky. You have to be very careful especially with a department like ours,"" Marcus said. Columbia College Departmental Representative Karl Kroeber said that the department still lacks faculty and will definitely have to continue hiring if the college increases by 300 students when the new dormitory, Schapiro Hall, opens in 1988. Because the English Department provides 40 percent of the Literature Humanities teaching staff the expansion of the student body will definately affect the English Department. ""Suppose you push the college enrollment from 2800 to 3200. That's 16 humanities sections [for a preceptor-student ration of 1:25]. That's 8 sections which we will have to provide teachers for. That's four junior faculty for us, "" Kroeber said. English is the most popular major in the col-lege and the expansion of the college would mean more English majors. Not only is the number of English majors increasing, Kroeber said, but so is the number of people who are not English majors who are taking upper-level courses. ""This is a problem. They cannot be the small discussion classes they should be. The average class size is running 60 to 75. It should be about 30."" Kroeber said that although the number of seminar courses for English majors has increased, he would like to see it increase further still. ""Over two semesters [last year] we had 10 seminars. I think this semester we have eight or nine,"" Kroeber said. He said he would like to see 12 to 19 seminars offered each semester. Although the official figures were not available yet, Kroeber said he did not expect any students to be excluded from lecture or seminar courses this semester. ""A person is less likely to be shut out of an area they like. Most won't be forced to take something they don't want. Most are taking what they want,"" Kroeber said.NO, I'M JUST BROWSING: A Columbia student's constant dilemma: so many earrings, so little time."
86,"CC faculty fear unification plan will harm core, admissions",5 November 1987,"By Tracy Connor and Josh GilletteThe President's Commission on the Future of the University released its long overdue report this summer. Throughout the semester, Spectator will look at aspects of the report, which recommends major changes in Columbia's structure. -w-% m /""tA plan currently on the table to merge the four faculties in the division of Arts and Sciences is meeting with strong resistance from Columbia College professors who argue that the proposal, if adopted, will cripple the autonomy of their school. Many faculty saidthey believe that a unified Faculty of the Arts and Sciences is an idea whose time has come, butone which may be difficult to realize without compromising crucial aspects of the curriculum and admissions standards of the constituents being unified. ""Strategies of Renewal,"" the report of the Presidential Commission, recommends the crea-tion of a single Faculty of Arts and Sciences encompassing the faculties of Columbia College(Columbia College), the School of General Studies (GS), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS), and the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). The new body would consist of instructors appointed to the 28 existing departments of instruction, and be headed by a single vice president and dean of the faculty of arts and sciences. The new structure would greatly reduce the power and responsiblities of the four deans now heading the consituent schools. At a recent Columbia College Faculty meeting, professors almost unanimously passed a resolution critical of unification, on the grounds that the merger would be detrimental to their school. Although, according to the Commission report, unification would bolster the Arts andSciences division in its competition with the Universtiy's professional schools for resources and attention, some professors contend that the division's strength would come at the cost of interference in Columbia College matters by faculty who don't teach undergraduates.""In the first place, as a matter of principle, the duty and task of the faculty is to decide about curriculum, and college policy, and that has to be decided by the people who are involved in it,"" said Professor of History Jacob Smit. Smit said the core curriculum,whose small classes and large number of instructors make it costly, might be hurt by professors in other divisions who don't consider it a worthwhile program. If the unification proposal is implemented, Columbia College policy would be debated and recommended by the already-existing Commitee on Instruction (COI) and then voted on by a full faculty. The COI of Columbia College is a body composed of college faculty, deans and students, who examine academic poicy. Despite the COl's authority over policy, some professors think that it is not a secure enough safeguard, and that separate faculties must be maintained to insure the four schools' interests are protected. English Professor Carl Hovde, a former Columbia College Dean, said, "" I have no reason to think whatsoever that the very expensive core curriculum at the College is disapproved of by anyone,"" but, he added, ""it is a very expensive enterprise. If there were any proposal to make it [the core] more economical with bigger classes and fewer teachers; people who are not involved with the College and know nothing about it shoudn't vote on it."" Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack, who opposes the unification, said that in the past several"
87,Proposed faculty merger worries college students,3 December 1987,"By Maria NievesThe merger of the faculties of the four schools making up the Arts and Sciences division has some students concerned over the future of Columbia College. The merger was proposed in a report released this past summer by the President's Commission of the Future of the University. The plan, if implemented, would merge the faculties of Columbia College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of General Studies and the School of International and Public Affairs. The proposal, which is being opposed by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack and the Columbia College faculty members, is also being questioned by students. ""I see the core of the University as Columbia College and if the University is to continue as it is, the core has to maintain its individuality,"" said Brian Domitrovic, CC '89. ""If anything would be hurt, it would be the core curriculum. If anything would be helped it would be courses in the graduate schools which are extraneous. A lot ofstudents don't know about them and as a result would probably begin to take more of them,"" he added. Most students surveyed said that they viewed the Columbia College faculty as distinctly separate from those of other Universtiy schools. They expressed concern that the merger would cause the school to lose its autonomy. ""I think it's important for it [Columbia College] to retain its autonomy. The tendency is for the undergraduates at other large universities like Harvard to be relegated to the less important position and to have graduate students dominate,"" said Rachel Perry, CC '89. Other students agreed. ""CC [Columbia College] would definitely lose its autonomous state,"" said Jeff Berg, CC '89. ""A lot of people who don't teach undergrads at all will have votes on academic affairs and their opinions couldn't be as well founded as those who know about [Columbia] College academics,"" Berg added. According to Adam Zalma, CC'91, the core curriculum would be especially threatened. ""The responsibility of professors toward the core curriculum may be jeopardized. The core might very well suffer because it would no longer be their prime responsibility. Professors would tend to take advantage of extra time in areas other than the core."" However, some students said they did not feel that there was any difference between the faculties of the schools now and that academic affairs would not be greatly altered. ""I'm really confused about what schools most professors teach for. I really don't think it matters and I don't think they [faculty members] think it matters either,"" said Keith Pardue, CC '88. One student said that the qualities of instruc-tion would not be degraded if the merger were to take place. ""No, there's not a distinct difference [between faculties]. Lit Hum [Literature Humanities] and CC [Contemporary Civilization] will always be taught by qualified faculty,"" said Thomas Dineen, CC '89. Many students confessed however that they were not adequately informed to make any judgments about the merger. ""I've read the Spectator articles and that's about it,"" said Matthew Cohen, CC '88. Cohen added that he believed University officials should inform students more thoroughly about the proposal. ""I know nothing about the faculty merger except what I've read in Spectator he said."
88,Book co-op plans expansion,25 January 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalFollowing two consecutive successful runs, the Columbia College book co-op reopens its doors today, offering Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations texts at a discount. Last semester, Columbia students anxious to avoid Bookforum and Barnes and Nobles prices, emptied the co-op shelves of their books in three days. This semester the Columbia Col-lege Student Council, which funds the co-op, ordered twice as many books to avoid an early sellout. The council is also working to expand the co-op to include ""high volume texts such as chemistry and physics texts and other Columbia items,"" said Co-President of the coop Ajay Dubey, CC '89. The co-op offers books at 15 percent off the publisher's list prices,and does not charge sales tax. The co-op was first established as a small operation in the fall of 1985 by Kaivan Shakib, CC '89, vice-chair of the college council and co-op president David Kerestzes, CC '88, said. They started with a few titles which they received at a 25 percent discount from book publishers, Shakib said. Dubey said he worked with several book companies over the summer who were willing to help set up expanded accounts with the co-op. This expansion, tripling the co-op's budget, would require more than just a tem-porary space at the beginning of the semester for the co-op, according to Dubey. Council members have been trying to find a permanent space from the building director of FBH but the council members do not expect a decision until early February, according to Dubey. The co-op will temporarily be located in room 105 of FBH, and will be open from 12 noon to 6 pm. The Council also hired people to work in the co-op instead of using volunteers as in the past, Shakib said."
89,Co-op reopens with extra titles,27 January 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalThe Columbia College book co-op will open today fully stocked after selling all of its Literature Humanities texts yesterday. Hundreds of Columbia students flooded the co-op Monday and Tuesday, according to copresident Kaivan Shakib, CC '89. The co-op offers Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization required books at a 15 percent discount. The co-op reordered and received 60 copies late yesterday of each of the major Literature Humanities titles that sold out, said AjayDubey, CC '89, co-president of the book co-op. According to Shakib, the co-op has grossed about $8,000 since it opened on Monday. He said he hopes that the success of the co-op will help the Columbia College Student Council find permanent space for the operation. ""The fact that we sell out every semester shows that there is a demand fora discount on books. The University should stop acting like a corporation and set up th co-op [on a permanent basis],"" Shakib said."
90,Contemplating the core,12 February 1988,"In the wake of World War I, the Columbia College faculty introduced Contemporary Civilization, a course that sought to explain the foundations of Western thought. In 1937, they added Literature Humanities, another required class that explored Western classics. While additions have been made since then, the core curriculum has retained its Western focus. Meanwhile, the student population has changed dramatically. From a men's school catering primarily to the white upper-class, the college has evolved into an institution more reflective of American society. Minority students represent a quarter of the student body; more than half of undergraduates receive financial aid; and there are nearly as many women as men enrolled in Columbia College, The core curriculum was originally designed to give students from different backgrounds a common foundation for learning. But today, that basis cannot encompass merely the Western world. Although the college has ""updated"" the core in response to criticism from faculty and students, the European orientation remains. On Monday, the Columbia College faculty can move toward creating a broader undergraduate curriculum. A proposal, drafted by the Committee on Instruction, would scrap the current remoteness requirement. In its place, students would study non-Western cultures. This plan would not impose an additional burden on students, since the number of required classes would remain the same. Rather, it would fulfill the original goal of the remoteness requirement—to give students a wellrounded education, while allowing them a wide variety of courses to choose from. The core curriculum is not just a set of required classes. It is the definition of what Columbia College judges to be essential knowledge. At its Monday meeting, the faculty can help rewrite the dictionary."
91,Cultures requirement in effect for class of 1990,16 February 1988,"By Jonathan EarleThe Columbia College faculty overwhelmingly passed a resolution creating a new ""major cultures"" requirement yesterday, calling for students to complete six points of courses in areas of non-European cultures. The new requirement, which willfirst effect the class of 1990, replaces the remoteness requirement, under which students must take six points of courses outside their declared field of interest in order to graduate. Columbia College administrators said after the faculty meeting that the new major cultures requirement willmake up for underrepresentation of certain world areas in the Core Curriculum. The courses which will count toward the major cultures requirement are yet to be decided, Rosenthal said, because the decision is part of a large-scale review of the college's entire Core Curriculum. The new committee will be chaired by John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary (see story this page). ""This should be considered as an interim requirement pending the findings of the deßary committee,"" Rosenthal said. ""The remoteness requirementalways struck us as not accomplishing very much. We [The Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI)] wanted to redefine the six points and make them more intellectually ambitious and more satisfying,"" he said. According to Rosenthal, the class of 1988 must use the old remoteness requirement to graduate, but current juniors will have an option whether to fulfill the remoteness requirement or the major cultures requirement. Sophomores will be totally responsible for the new requirement, unless they demonstrate difficulty in completing it to the Columbia Collegedeans, he said. English Professor and chair of the Literature Humanities program James Mirollo, said although the major cultures requirement is an improvement over the remoteness requirement, it still needs to be more focused. ""What we approved today was an interim step—it's still unclear and has some problems, but this together with the [deßary] committee's looking at the core is overall very good,"" Mirollo said. Rosenthal said the remoteness requirement was developed in the late 1960s when the faculty decided that students needed a more rounded undergraduate experience after the Contemporary Civilization program was scaled down. ' 'No one felt that this was the ultimate form of a distribution requirement,"" Rosenthal said. Originally, a committee formed by the COI to examine replacing the remoteness requirement proposed a program similar to the current major cultures requirement in conjunction, the committee suggested adding Women's Studies and African American Studies courses to the major cultures, according to History Professor Ainslee Embree, who chaired the committee. However, Rosenthal said that Embree's proposal was too complicated to be implementedas a degree requirement. ""In an ideal world, the committee's more compelling proposal might have been implemented. But it seems to me it's better to go with what we have rather than a more complicated requirement that is less likely to occur,"" Rosenthal said. ""It seems to us a more manageable curricular change,"" he said. Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack said although the deßary committee will eventually recommend which courses will count towards the new requirement, all courses dealing with cultures not currently covered by the core, including African Studies, should satisfy the requirement. He said he hopes to have a group of faculty members make up a final list of courses that will satisfy the requirement in time for the fall semester. The faculty also unanimously voted into action a Women's Studies program with a major, Rosenthal said. In order to complete a major in Women's Studies, students must take five specifically required courses, in addition to four courses from a soon-to-be-approved list of Women's Studies courses in the Columbia College catalogue and 15 points of courses from an approved department, Rosenthal said.Michael Rosenthal"
92,Core comes up for review New commission named to look into future of CC's curriculum,16 February 1988,"New commission named to look into future of CC's curriculumBy Jonathan EarleColumbia College's rarely revised Core Curriculum faces an extensive review this year by a new committee designed to evaluate the school's undergraduate requirements. The formation of this committee was announced yesterday afternoon at a meeting of the Columbia College Faculty, according to Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack. Theodore deBary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, will chair the sub-committees that will examine Columbia College's core. A close examination of the Core Curriculum is needed, according to Pollack. ""It's time to review the curriculum we all take for granted,"" Pollacksaid. ""The last time it was looked at was more than a decade ago."" Deßary said his committees willconduct a ""comprehensive"" review of the core, unlike previous evaluations which concentrated solely on what courses and works the core should contain. ""We were asked to conduct a general and complete examination of the entire core —in all its parts and methods,"" deßary said. Deßary estimated the evaluation process will take at least a year, and divided his agenda into stages. He said the examination will begin this spring by forming of committees which would represent components of the core, such as Literature Humanities, and conducting hearings. ""We plan to ask for each of the staffs [of core courses] to assemble and engage in a selfevaluation —what they're doing, where they're succeeding, where they're not,"" deßary said. The evaluation will include input from students and alumni as well as faculty recommendations, deßary said. ""We need at least three bodies of testimony to assess the dimensions of the problem in the present situation,"" he added. Debary plans to then appoint task forces which will attend to problems the committees find in the core. ""Even though we were pioneers in this business, others have had some experience. We'd like to find out why or why not they've been successful,"" he said. Debary said he also wants committees of students and alumni to participate in the final recommendations. He added that he expects to make some changes when the evaluation process is conmplete. ""In liklihood we will reaffirm the need and value of some core curriculum, and then add some new elements. I wouldn't be surprised if there were some changes,"" deßary said. He said he wants to make an initial survey of the problems in the Core Curriculum by the end of the semester. Pollack said Columbia could only benefit from a close examination of the core. ""This is a great opportunity for the collegeto become stronger. The process may be slower, but the result will last longer,"" Pollack said. English Professor James Mirollo, who chairs the Literature Humanities program, agreed the core is ready for reevaluation and deßary is a good choice to direct the process. ""We've had some big anniverseries lately—so years of Lit Hum, next year is 70 years of CC. But there hasn't been a discussion of the whole package in a long time; only what books will be read,"" Mirollo said. One of the committees to be chaired by deßary will decide which courses will satisfy the new major cultures requirement passed yesterday by the Columbia College faculty, according to Pollack (see story this page). The new requirement, which replaces the core's remoteness requirement, calls for at least six points of courses dealing with cultures underrepresneted in the Core Curriculum to be taken in order to graduate. According to Associate Professor of Japanese Paul Anderer, the passage of a new requirement has provided the college an opportunity to thoroughly evaluate its curriculum. ""I think the core could stand some serious scrutiny—a detailed study of its strengths, limitations, its areas to be revitalized,"" Anderer said. Deßary said it is important that his committees include not only current professors, but also older or retired faculty members who have watched the core develop over the years. ""The core has undergone many changes— we have to review the whole process. It may have been working better in earlier years than now,"" deßary said. Regardless of the poroblems the subcommittees might find with the core, deßary said he could not envisage the college abandoning the core all together. ""If we didn't have something worth preserving, we wouldn't be putting all this effort into evaluating and hopefully improving it,"" deßary said.Robert Pollack"
93,Students condemn Federalist survey as eurocentric,2 March 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalCiting a recent Federalist Paper survey as eurocentric and biased, three students conducted a poll of their own last night. The FP survey, which was conducted Monday evening outside the John Jay dining hall by members of that publication's staff, was designed to measure the ""general knowledge"" of Columbia students. ""In coniuntion with The Dart-mouth Reveiw, the Fed is conducting a poll to test the level of knowledge of Columbia students. The results will be compared with results for the same poll taken by students at Harvard and Dartmouth,"" according to the survey. The FP poll asked students to answer 27 questions, including ""What is the capital of West Germany?"" and ""Who wrote ThePrince?"" Cara Lesser, BC'9O, Michelle Gottlieb, BC'B9, and Laura Curran, BC'9O, condemned the survey, saying that the questions focused exclusively on white, male, westernoriented culture. ""It's not just sexist, but elitist,"" Curran said. Lesser argued that the poll discriminated against students whoare not familiar with American culture. The survey also discriminated against women, Gottlieb said. ""There wasn't one question about women [on the survey], 50 percent of our population is composed of women and they were left out,"" she said. Stephen Later, CC '90, an FP editor, refused to comment on either poll or the students' claims. ""I think it [the poll] demonstrates a comprehensive lack of knowledge on their part,"" Later asserted. Later said he did not know how many students were questioned or the results of the poll. Other members of the FP staff were unavailable for comment. Gottlieb maintained that she, Lesser and Curran were not trying to discredit the questions on the FP poll, but were outraged at the type ot questions that were not included. ""It's not what they put in, it's what they left out,"" she said. According to Gottlieb, she, Lesser and Curran handed out 400 polls of their own and received 30 completed ones back. In contrast to the FP, this poll, which also contained 27 questions, asked students questions such as ""What is the capital of Nigeria?"" and ""Who wrote Fortune is a Woman?'' ""We are trying to open people's eyes more so they see the world ex-tended beyond Europe and the plush University,"" Lesser said. Gottlieb added that she believed many students did not return the survey because they were embarrassed that they were unable to answer many of the questions correctly. "" Out of about 27 questions, the average [number of correct answers] was about 27 percent,"" she said. Floraine Kay, CC '89, said she took bothsurveys and was embarrassed that she was only able to answer a few questions on the Barnard students' survey. ""The first [FP] survey was very specific to the topics covered in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. It was completely ethnocentric,"" Kay said. ""The second poll [that of the Barnard students] shows we need our education broadened,"" she added.BOOKSHELVES GALORE: New bookshelves, courtesy of students, were ordered for all campus libraries.

94,CC book co-op finds a permanent home,28 March 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalThe Ferris Booth Hall (FBH) advisory board granted the Columbia College book co-op permanent spacein FBH, which will allow it to operate year-round, according to Columbia College Student Council Chair Jared Goldstein, CC '89, a board member. The co-op will occupy its new space this fall, Goldstein said. For the last two years, the book co-op has offered Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization texts at a 15 to 20 percent discount off publishers' prices. The founders of the book co-op have been ""talking about it [finding a permanent space] since last year,""said co-op President David Keresztes, CC '89. Obtaining the space took a year of meetings with the building advisory board, Goldstein said. ""We had some resistance to it [getting permanent space] at first but when we kept pushing it and the coop straightened up their accounts, they agreed to the space,"" Goldstein said. The co-op will probably be open for seven days a week during hours that are ""designed around students'schedules,"" said Kaivan Shakib, CC'B9, vicechair of the council and one of the co-op's founders. Having permanent space will allow the coop to sell CC and Lit Hum books throughout the semester, Keresztes said. The new space also means the co-op can expand its selling capacity to include high volume texts, t-shirts, and stationery, co-op CoPresident Ajay Dubey, CC'B9 said.HOME SWEET HOME: The Columbia College book co-op, pictured here at temporary quarters, has found a permanent spot."
95,Core Curriculum commission to hold hearings this week,5 April 1988,"By Jonathan EarleA newly chartered commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the Columbia College Core Curriculum will hear student views on the subject at its first open forum tomorrow at the Hey man Center. At the commission's first meeting last Thursday, the group agreed on how the review would proceed and on a schedule of open hearings which will span the next two semesters, ac-cording to commission chair Ted deßary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University. According to deßary, the Core Curriculum will also hear from chair of the Literature Humanities Staff James Mirollo, and Chair of the Contemporary Civilizations (CC) staff Ainslie Embree, on the state of their respective programs.Later this semester, the commission is scheduled to discuss problems of the Core with University Administrators and alumni. The commission will also hear a panel of veteran instructors discuss the possibility of a second year of CC, deßary said. Deßary said all the hearings will be open to students, and that he especially hopes for student input at tomorrow's meeting. ""In principle, we want the meetings to be open. That's why we're starting out by listening to students,"" deßary said. According to deßary, a review of the Core is necessary to ensure that Columbia remains an innovative leader in liberal education. ""This is a golden opportunity, and we must take advantage of it. This is a chance for Columbia to show leadership it hasn't fora while,"" deßary said. Deßary said he hopes to finish reviewing the current state of the Core by the end of the summer, and present his commission's recommendations to Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack, who chartered the commission in the fall. Deßary goes on academic leave in January of 1989. Although the commission has yet to makeany formal decisions, deßary said he would like to implement an improved science requirement and the introduction of contemporary world problems, such as the environment and evolution into the CC course. ""Back in the '30's and '40's, major world problems [such as the Depression] were addressed in the Core. I would be surprised if the idea didn't win some support,"" deßary said. Deßary said that instead of intensifying the staffing problem currently plaguing the Core the addition of instruction in major world problems to the curriculum could actually alleviate the problem. ""Staffing wouldn't necessarily be more difficult. For example, the issue of the environment would involve the geology department. These issues would enlist the recources of all parts of the University,"" deßary said. Tomorrow's hearing is at 12:15 p.m. in the Heyman Center Conference Room. It will feature presentations by Columbia College Student Council chair Jared Goldstein, CC '89, and other members of the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee and Student Council.UI liV, J r» 1 \_/IV JUL/lfl IIV/1/VJIX7 UV7 112 L/ I CU'S FINEST: Security guards caught up with the news at Hamilton yesterday."
96,Giordano wins in close race for SGA pres.,11 April 1988,"By Julie ZuckermanApproximately 41 percent of the Barnard student body voted in last week's Student Government Association (SGA) election, according to SGA Vice President of Student Government Mithra Merry man, BC '88. ""Nine hundred and three students voted, which is a very high number for Barnard. Excluding the senior class, almost 50 percent of the other classes voted,"" Merryman said. Elections were held last Tuesday, April 5, to Thursday, April 7. Christine Giordano, BC '89, was elected to the top position of SGA President. Giordano said she sees her position as the tie between the students and the administration. ""Most importantly, I want it [SGA] to be a lot more visible next year. I want to make the administration aware of what students really want,"" she said. Giordano said she will plan bi-weekly meetings with Barnard President Ellen Futter. Merryman said that the electionfor SGA president was very close. ""Chris won by three votes,"" she said. The other contestants for SGA President were Gloria Mamba, BC '89, and Doris Hertzfeld, BC '89. Leora Joseph, BC '90, who was elected SGA Vice President of Student Government, said, ""I intend to make all the [Rpresentative] Rep Council meetings open and advertise them,"" Joseph said. ""I want to see Rep Council have an influence on things like school spirit, curriculum and admission standards. I want to see it be a truly efficient and representative body,"" she added. Peggy Wang, BC '90, was elected SGA Vice President of Student Activities. Wang said she hlpes to help create more enthusiasm for joining clubs at Barnard. Wang also said she would like to see change machines in the laundry rooms, more tickets for Boradway and Off-Broadway shows, and more parties at Mcintosh. She plans to start a student newsletter where people can advertise books or tickets they want to sell. Wang said she is interested in sponsoring more activities jointly with the rest of the University. ""I want to make Barnard more attractive to both its students and to the entire University,"" she added. Amy Blumberg, BC '89, is the newly elected SGA Treasurer. ""Basically, there's been a lot of talk about the lack of school spirit at Barnard,"" Blumberg said. ""Next year, with all the freshmen on campus and with the [Barnard] centennial, there should be a lot more school spirit,"" she added. Ilene Stern, BC '89, the new SGA Officer of the Board, said she wants to create a""historic continuous record"" of all articles pertaining to SGA that appear in the Barnard Bulletin and Spectator. This would make it easier to reply to accusations made against SGA, she said. Three students were elected to the new position of Representative-At-Large. They are Lisa Gersten, BC '90, Andrea Lehman, BC '89, and Esther Rosenfeld, BC '89. Gersten said she will concentrate on improving SGA and helping students take an active role in shaping Barnard's identity. ""There might be more revamping of SGA next year. I'm really excited about the changes [that took place this year], but there's always room for improvement,"" she said. Gersten said she is interested in forming a new women's center. ""Barnard's identity should be molded by its students. I think that the administration needs students' input about where we see Barnard going,"" Gersten said. Rosenfeld said that the position of Representative-At-Large was created this year because there had been previously no one to take on ad-hoc issues when they arose. One Rep-At-Large will be taking on some of the responsibility of the Financial Aid Committee, which was dissolved this year, she said. ""One of the things I'd like to do is to see if Barnard can get involved in the Columbia College Book Co-op. In the past they have sold Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities books. I would like to see if Barnard students can also get their books fora cheaper price,"" she said. The new Liaison to Columbia College isMary-Ann Maytas, BC '89, and the Engineering Representative is Shannon Lafferty, BC '90. Maytas, Lafferty and Lehman could not be reached for comment. Elizabeth Davis, BC '89, was elected as the representative to the Board of Trustees. ""What are the concerns that are most important to the students? I will also look at the hot issues and research the issues that are not on the front pages of our newspapers but that are also important in students' minds,"" Davis said. The Barnard student body elected Sylvia Cabana, BC '89, as president of the Class of 1989. ""I'm really excited because next year is the centennial and we are the centennial class,"" she said. Cabana added that she ""wants to promote unity not only among the Barnard senior class, but also with the Columbia College and Engineering senior classes."" She would like to hold many social events and career panels, generate interest in campus issues, and ahve the class get involved with the homeless. The other senior class officers are Janis Lino, vice president, and Kua Tai, treasurer. The office of secretary remains open.The new president of the Class of 1990 is Deborah Goldstein, BC '90. ""I really would like to get the class a little bit more unified. It is difficult because right now the class is so separated, with students living at the Lucerne, 110 th Street and Brooks-Hewitt-Reid (BHR). I'd like to hold more parties, movies and brunches,"" Goldstein said. The newly elected junior class officers are Sarah Rahman, vice president, Alice Kulik, treasurer, and Michelle Sullivan, secretary. Sara Bucholtz, BC '91, was elected president of the Class of 1991. ""I'm very excited for the upcoming year,"" she said. ""I'm looking forward to wroking with the other officers. I'd like to help other sophomores by obtaining information about studying abroad and about choosing majors."" Bucholtz said that she will be ""working to get all 500 students in the Class of 1991 involved and caring about issues and psyched about the things we do."" The other officers for the sophomore class are Kathleen McNamara, vice president, Melissa Lee, treasurer and Bina Kalola, secretary."
97,"Hearings on core kick off with prof, student testimony",14 April 1988,"By Jonathan EarleAt an open hearing yesterday on the Columbia College Core Curriculum, members of a newly chartered commission to study the core discussed the future and shortcomings of the Literature Humanities course. Chair of the Humanities staff and commission member James Mirollo presented a report outlining what he saw as major problems with the course. He cited the abandonment of Lit Hum by senior faculty members, the narrow scope of the current syllabus, and the possibility that the course is outdated. Great books courses such as Lit Hum have come under fire in recent years for neglecting the views and works of Non-Western and women authors. Stanford University recentlyscrapped its Great Books Course in favor of a course including minority and women writers, and the Village Voice recently described Columbia's Lit Hum as a course which only addresses the ""same dead white boys."" Mirollo said he does not see Lit Hum emerging from the review unchanged. ""I can think of no scenario for the status quo to continue. I do not honestly think it can or should,"" Mirollo said. A major problem cited by Mirollo is the low number of senior faculty members teaching the course. Of the 55 Lit Hum sections, according to Mirollo only four are taught by tenured faculty members. ""Senior faculty simply aren'tteaching the course and assistant professors find it burdensome,"" Mirollo said. However, Mirollo said he does not envision the total abandonment of the Lit Hum course. ""To replace it by another course completely would be an obviously drastic solution. It would offend both alumni and current students who love the course,"" Mirollo said. One possible outcome of the review could be the addition of a course similar to Stanford's, in which 19th and 20th century works are divided thematically and presented in a small lecture class, according to Mirollo. Inthis scenario, the original Lit Hum course would be limited to pre-19th century works. ""This is a good solution if we decide we can't have both in the same course,"" he said. Mirollo said the commission could create the course, tentatively titled ""Voice and Cultures,"" which would satisfy the new major cultures requirement to be taken in conjunction with Lit Hum. The Core Commission will discuss the current problems of the Contemporary Civilization course at its next open hearing, Wednesday at 12:15 at the Heyman Center."
98,Deadlock at Lit Hum review leaves the syllabus unchanged,22 April 1988,"By Jonathan EarleBecause Literature Humanities instructors failed to agree on syllabus modifications, the reading list for next year is unchanged, according to Chair of the Humanities program James Mirollo. Mirollo cited the instructors' sense that the course lacks overall direction as a reason for the deadlock. The Lit Hum syllabus is normally revised every two years by a vote of the instructors teaching the course. This year two replacement syllabiwere presented, and according to Mirollo, neither received the 51 percent approval required for acceptance. ""Usually we have only two [proposed syllabi],"" Mirollo said. ""This year 11 members voted for neither—this obviously made the difference."" The first syllabus, which was presented by an appointed committee, made significant changes in therequired course's reading list, especially for the second semester, said one Lit Hum preceptor who asked not to be identified. This syllabus would have replaced The Decameron, Faust, and the instuctor's choice piece with works by a woman, a black and a Latin American author. In addition, Lit Hum's first semester reading of Plato's Apology and Republic, and Aristotle's Ethics, works also covered in Contemporary Civilization, would have been replaced by Herodotus and Lucretius. The other syllabus suggested last week at a meeting of Lit Hum instructors was much more conservative, according to Mirollo. The failure of instructors to come to a consensus is an illustration of the need fora reevaluation of the course, Mirollo said. ""I think the staff needs some guidance from the Columbia College faculty about what we need to be addressing. We're going to have to rethink the whole thing [course],'' Mirollo said. Last Wednesday Mirollo delivered a report detailing what he views as the problem facing the course to the recently created deßary commission. The commission is reevaluating the entire Core Curriculum, including Lit Hum.Mirollo said the vote may have been influenced by the fact that the deßary commission has the authority to overturn any instructor-approved syllabus when it releases its report in the fall. ""Everyone was aware of the fact that we might have been spinning wheels, making changes in a vacuum,"" Mirollo said. Lit Hum instructors had mixed reactions to the prospect of teaching the identical course for the third year in a row. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Wallace Gray opposed the current syllabus because it does not include certain works he likes teaching. ""In general I've been unhappy that Cervantes and Rabelais are exluded. Both had been on the syllabus since the inception of the course,"" Gray said. Gray added that he assigns Cervantes' Don Quixote and Rabelais' Gargantua to his Lit Hum section despite the syllabus. Lit Hum preceptor Peter Walker said he too was upset at the result of the balloting. ""I would have liked to see some change,"" Walker said. ""Even a slight change in the syllabus would add some variety."""
99,Literature for less at coop,1 September 1988,"Thrifty students every year flood the Columbia College Book Coop to buy theii Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization books. This year the Coop has ordered more Lit Hum and CC books than ever before, and will also sell books for popular courses such as Elementary Physics (Physics for Poets) and Professor Hilsman's Politics of Policy Making. The Coop's popularity with students stems from its low prices, about 25 percent off of list, according to Coop President David Keresztes, CC '89, and because of the alternative—Barnes and Noble, famous for long lines and high prices. Barnes and Noble's contract ex-pired last month, and due to what University Senior Vice President Joseph Mullinix called general dissatisfaction with the bookstore, other vendors are being allowed to bid for the spot. The Coop, on the other hand, is steadily growing, and was granted permanent University space last year. Its not-for-profit structure keeps prices low, and even provides income for work-study students. The Coop, located in 309 Ferris Booth Hall, will be open Sept. 8 from 12-5, and from 11-6 every day after that until its inventory sells out, which in the past has taken only a few days. —Melissa Mlchelson"
100,"Core, Schmore",1 September 1988,"By Jonathan EarleSo you thought Columbia College's core curriculum was a complete bastion of stability? Well, sorry— everything, even the core, has to come up lor review sometime. A committee of protessors comissioned by Dean Robert Pollack to evaluate and recommend changes for the core has been meeting since March to revamp a curriculum some have criticized as euro centric. The core curriculum, the set of common courses each Columbia College student must complete for graduation, has its roots in the required Contemporary Civilization (CC) course created in 1919. Today, in addition to one year of CC, the core includes a full year of Literature Humanities (Lit-Hum), a semester each of Music and Art Humanities, English 1007, two semesters of Physical Education, two semesters of science, and four semesters or the equivalent of a foreign language. While the core commission, chaired by John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary, has yet to make any formal recommendations, one aspect of the new and improved core is already in effect: the new ""major cultures"" requirement. The requirement, approved by the faculty last February, calls for all Columbia College students to complete six points of courses dealing with ' 'other major cultures not covered under the present core,'' according to History Professor Anslie Embree, who chaired the committee which selected courses to fulfill the new requirement. The major cultures requirement, which replaces theunfocused and unpopular ""remoteness"" requirement, will affect all members of the class of 1992, as well as current juniors and sophomores, Embree said. He added that certain courses dealing with issues of gender and race, as well as those covering Latin America, will satisfy the requirement. The outgoing remoteness requirement vaguely called for six points of courses to be taken outside the student's area of major or concentration. As with its predecessor, students must take courses outside their major fields to satisfy the new cultures requirement. Lists of the courses which satisfy the major cultures requirement are available in the Registrar's office and the Dean of Students office. However, Embree pointed out that the major cultures requirement is an ""interim requirement,"" for use while the deßary commission is debating the larger restructuring of the core curriculum. ""This is not a definitely permanent thing—but I do expect it to be enforced at least this year and next,"" Embree said. While the major cultures requirement is the first visible change in the core in quite a while, Pollack said last spring that it is just one part of the total review of the curriculum. He said then that it was ""time to review the curriculum we all take for granted. The last time it was looked at was more than a decade ago."" Pollack also said the current evaluation would be more ""comprehensive"" than previous at-tempts. This time the commission will look at the overall curriculum, instead of concentrating only on what specific courses and works the core should contain, Pollack said. Last spring deßary, who was a first year Columbia student in 1937, the year Lit Hum was made a required course, scheduled a series of opei- ( hearings to discuss and evaluate different aspects of the curriculum. Columbia's core has come under fire in recent years for dealing too exclusively with the works and thinking of white, European males. Works by minorities and women have been added to the syllabi of many core courses, but these additions are often viewed as ""token."" While deßary has said he expects some changes to come out of his commission's evaluation, he said he cannot see Columbia doing away with the core entirely. ' 'In likelihood we will reaffirm the need and value of some core curriculum, and then add some new elements. I wouldn't be surprised if there were some changes,'' deßary said in February. ""If we didn't have something worth preserving, we wouldn't be putting all this effort into evaluating and hopefully improving it,""he said. Deßary originally said it woul take at least a year for the commis sion to come up with its recommendations, so hearings will most likely continue through the fall semester. That means all of you still get to read Aristotle and Augustine. Happy reading.AH, HAMILTON: All hope abandon ye who enter here"

103,Students flock to buy texts at expanded CC book coop,9 September 1988,"By Joshua C. GilletteOpening its doors yesterday for its fourth year of operation, the Columbia College Book Coop sold more than half of its Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and Contemporary Civilization (CC) texts, netting more than $12,600 before costs. Coop managers say most of the books offered, which this year for the first time include texts for popular science, economics, and political science courses, will probably be gone by tomorrow or this weekend at the latest. ""It's really an incredibleresponse,"" said Coop President David Keresztes, CC '89. In addition to Lit Hum books at 25 percent off list price and CC books at 15 percent off, the coop this year offers discounts on books for two economics courses, two political theory courses, seven physics courses, and an organic chemistry course. One quarter of these new additions were sold yesterday, Keresztes said. The total stock, which the coop bought for about $30,000, includes180 copies of 16 different CC titles and 13 Lit Hum titles. Books were purchased from more than 20 publishers at discounts of 15 to 45 percent off the list price. They are sold at 10 percent profit to cover the cost of shipping and to pay the 10-person coop staff, Keresztes said. Although it has never done so in the past, the Coop may have to pay state sales tax out of the profits it makes, Keresztes said. ""Currently, we are in the process of determining our tax status with University lawyers,"" he said. But the additional cost of the tax would not mean a hike in prices, he added. Books for the core courses were sold yesterday in 309 Ferris Booth Hall (FBH), while other books were sold out of 320 FBH. Because so many core course books were sold, the coop can be consolidated today, and will sell all its books from 320 FBH, Keresztes said. The coop is open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and will operate daily until all books are sold. The success of the coop has always hinged on its ability to compete with the Barnes and Noble bookstore and on the willingness of professors to order books through it and tell students about it. The ten professors coop managers contacted""were very enthusiastic about ordering through us,"" Keresztes said. ""I don't like Barnes and Noble,"" said Ajay Dubay, CC '89, coop manager. ""They have an incredible mark-up, a virtual monopoly on the Columbia area, the lines are very long there, and the service is very poor."" Barnes and Noble's contract with the University expired last month, and administrators, citing general dissatisfaction with the bookstore, are allowing other vendors to bid for the spot."
104,"Committee to consider future of Lit Hum, CC",29 September 1988,"By Penny Britell and A. Cassidy SehgalMembers of the Columbia College Core Commission, a committee chartered to reevaluate the future of the core curriculum will begin meeting today, commission Chair, according to Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University. This semester's core curriculum commission will consist of professors who teach core courses, and one quarter of the members will be junior faculty, deßary said. Among the junior faculty on the committee are Marie Kilfeather, assistant professor of English and Comparative literature; Elaine Sisman, assistant professor of music; and Francis Pritchett, assistant professor of Middle East Languages and Culture. Input from student groups will alsobe welcome, he said. Deßary added that he believes the scope of the core needs to be extended to address issues and problems that students face in their daily lives. ""To represent the extended aspect of the core which concerns itself with our society, there are some who think the core should be just the classics and the past. As a matter of fact that has not been the case since the beginning—Contemporary Civilization was meant to address contemporary problems,"" deßary said. ""We feel the core ought to [in some ways] provide the students with the themes and problems of contemporary society,"" he added. The committee will also review thefuture of Literature Humanities which has been criticized as being outdated, eurocentric and male-oriented. In addition, one of the committees deßary will chair plans to review the list of courses that fulfill the new major cultures requirement. The current list was compiled this summer by a committee chaired by Professor of History Ainslee Embree. Debary said he is confident the core review and evaluation report will be complete by the end of the semester. The formation of the committee was announced last February, by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack. ""It's time to review the curriculum we all take for granted,"" Pollack said last February. ""The last time it was looked at was more than a decade ago."" Pollack said Columbia could only benefit from a close examination of the core. ""This is a great opportunity for the college to become stronger. The process may be slower but the result will last longer,"" Pollack said."
105,DeBary comm. may add non-Western texts to core,30 September 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalMembers of the deßary Commission on the Core Curriculum, a group charted to re-evaluate Columbia College's required courses, held its first meeting of the semester yesterday. The commission chair, Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, issued draft proposals yesterday on strengthening and extending the existing core curriculum. The committee began discussing the possibility of limiting the Literature Humanities course to Western texts, and ending the course with 18th century works.A course that covered a more limited time span would allow for further in-depth discussion of the writings studied, committee members said. The course currently covers writings through modern times. Limiting the course to Western texts is the only feasible way to teach the course and keep it coherent for both students and instructors, committee members said. Members also said the introduction of nonWestern texts into the course syllabus would not do justice to any of the works, and would not allow students to formulate and challenge ideas they receive from a common set of writings. ""We're not going to bring in tidbits [about different cultures into the course]. Students want to read the texts and enjoy them,"" Assistant Professor of Middle East Languages and Cultures Francis Pritchet said. However, other members of the committee argued that non-Western cultures have become an integral part of Western culture and should be addressed. ""The issue of non-Western books should be considered not just on the level of the major cultures requirement,"" Associate Professor of Japanese Paul Anderer said. It was also argued that instructors are morecapable today of teaching non-Western texts, such as the Bhagvad Gita, since they have come to be more widely read in recent years. The most critical issues facing the humanities course is finding professors who are both qualified and willing to teach the course, Anderer said. ""Our primary focus is on the quality of instruction,"" Anderer said. ""We are facing much more of of a crisis in the teaching profession,"" he added. The committee also discussed the possibility of inviting experts on certain texts to conduct lectures in addition to regular class discussions. However, many committee members voiced objections to this proposal, saying it would stifle students' abilities to formulate their own ideas. The committee will continue to consider the various proposals at their October meeting, and will meet with members of the Humanities department and interested students before making any final decisions, deßary said. Final revisions of the entire core, which includes the new major cultures requirement, will not be complete until December, ""when we [the committee] have enough views to formulate our own ideas,"" deßary said last week.William Theodore deßary"
106,Core Comm.: Inclusion of non-Western texts up to profs.,7 October 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalThe committee reviewing Columbia College's core curriculum decided yesterday that unless instructors teaching first-semester Literature Humanities strongly favor adding non-Western texts to the course's reading list, the committee will not recommend their inclusion when it issues its report in December. ""We've decided on that [limiting Humanities A] tentatively until we've reviewed the whole range of issues,"" said Commission Chair William Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University. ""For the time being, we've reasoned that it's not practical to include non-Western texts.""Including a few non-Western texts in the syllabi would be a token gesture that would not do justice to any of the works and would destroy the cohesiveness of the course, some committee members have argued. ""Adding non-Western texts may just displace something of major importance, and it's not worth it if you have to leave out major works such as Shakespeare,"" deßary said. Committee members have also said they do not think many faculty members can adequately teach and incorporate non-Western texts into the Humanities A course.""People just teach a course [fora short time] and then get rotated out of the system just when they're beginning to understand and teach the material. Part of the problem is keeping professors in the program [teaching core classes],"" deßary said. At yesterday's meeting, the committee also discussed a second proposal to limit Humanities A texts to 18th-century works. However, no consensus was reached on the issue among committee members. Other committee members said that the introduction of modern textswould help students relate the past to the present and help them understand society's evolution.. Reading contemporary works if essential in helping students crystallize their own ideas about modern issues, according to Assistant Professor of Political Science Harvey Goldman. However, other committee members said that the addition of post-18th-century books is unnecessary since modern themes are always discussed in the context of the assigned texts, whether they are an-cient Greek classics or Shakespearean plays. Adding texts would disrupt the pace of the course and increase students' workloads, they asserted. Committee members also said that modern and non-Western texts will be used in other required courses—the courses used to satisfy the major cultures requirement or any other classes added to the core. Associate Professor of East Asian Language of Culture Paul Anderer said the committee should not evaluate proposals on the future of the humanities courses until it has considered the problem of finding faculty who are willing and qualified to teach them. ""Our highest priority should be to change the existing structure [of how the core courses are taught],"" Anderer said. Deßary agreed that the faculty shortage problem is a main consideration, adding that anongoing committee should be established to review the core. ""I'm very strongly in favor of establishing a standing committee to evaluate the core, not just every year, but continuously,"" he said. ""The committee should reevaluate programs and different aspects of the curriculum and make proposals for new courses and test them on an experimental basis."" ""We need a mechanism that will represent the college faculty and students and will take a look at the overall direction and scope of core courses that won't regard courses as sacrosanct or fixed,"" he added. The committee will continue to meet weekly, with the rest of the month devoted to the Literature Humanities question. Members will meet with the Humanities faculty later this month."

108,Lit Hum remains open to modern texts,14 October 1988,"By A. Cassidy SehgalThe committee reviewing the future of the Columbia College core curriculum decided yesterday to give instructors teaching Literature Humanities the option of ending the course with 18th Century texts since no consensus could be reached by committee members. ""It is not a major change. What we're saying is that we would allow professors to limit Humanities A [Lit Hum] to the 18th Century or before, but not mandate that. Other instructors can include texts from the 19th or 20th Century if they choose to do so,"" said Commission Chair Wm. Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University. Many commission members have said that including modern texts in the course is essential for helping students relate the past to the present and formulate ideas about modern issues. However, other committee members argued that the addition of post-18th Century books is not necessary since modern themes arealways discussed in the context of the assigned texts. Adding texts would disrupt the pace of the course, these professors argued. Committee members said another reason they did not make a final decision on the proposal was because they did not want to stifle future re-evaluation of the core. Committee members agreed there is a need for an ongoing committee that will review the curriculum frequently and make proposals for new additions to the core. ""We need a mechanism that willrepresent the college faculty and students and will look at the overall direction and scope of core courses and won't regard courses as sacrosanct or fixed,"" deßary said last week. Committee members also decided that the instructional format of the course should be maintained, and that the addition of optional guest lectures on course material would give students an extra viewpoint on the texts. However, they could not find a solution to finding staff members who are willing and able to teach the course. ""People just teach a course [fora few years] and then get rotated out of the system just when they're beginning to unerstand and teach the material. Part of the problem in keeping professors in the program,"" deßary said last week. The inexperience of the junior faculty in teaching Literature Humanities is the key problem, according to a draft proposal written by Robert Belknap, professor of Slavic Languages. Belknap suggested creating a six-year fellowship for preceptors in which they wouldteach Humanities courses and eventually become regular assistant professors, with a full salary and teaching load, in the department of their fields of study. The fellowship could also include a year-long leave for the preceptors to search for jobs either at Columbia or at other institutions. Committee members argued, however, that there is no incentive for graduate students to remain in such a long-term program since one or two years of experience is just as good for their resumes, and that preceptors are not accorded enough respect as members of the teaching staff. However, deßary said, ""graduate students are an essential part of the mix of instructors."" He added, ""Our job is to enhance the position of the preceptors and provide appropriate rewards for their services, which are highly valuable."" But finding older faculty members to teach the courses is stil a pressing problem, he added. Deßary said this issue will be discussed extensively at future meetings, since it is one of the most critical problems facing the core."
109,Junior faculty unhappy teaching Lit Hum,18 November 1988,"By Ann-Marie WongSamThe chair of the Columbia English department told the committee reviewing the Core Curriculum yesterday that there is widespread discontent with the Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) course among junior faculty. According to chair of the department Joan Ferrante and other professors, some junior faculty do not feel comfortable with the Western European, male-oriented approach to the course, and some do not feel knowledgeable enough about the required texts. Others dislike having to teach the class when they could be working on their own specialties. ""There are people teaching the course who don't believe in it and that's not best,"" Ferrante said. The commission, chaired by William Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University, was formed by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack lastspring to conduct a thorough examination of the core and to make recommendations for change. Robert Hanning, English department vice chair, said that besides the numerous ideological and philosophical reasons why the nontenured professors are opposed to teaching the course,""there is also the duly professional one, the sense that if one is going to carry on in the profession, then it is more important to be doing one's own work in one's own area of studies."" The problem extends to the senior faculty members, he said. Once senior faculty cease teaching Lit Hum fora period of time, they are often reluctant to return, Hanning explained. Hanning said he could not speak for the junior faculty, but he sensed that many felt uncomfortable with the Western European male-oriented approach to Lit Hum and the lack ofincorporation of sufficient race and gender questions into the course. Assistant Professor of English Siobhan Kilfeather said the discontent of her fellow colleagues is indication of a changing intellectual climate and a declining confidence in the Western canon and narrative which ""don't work any more.""Ferrante said most tenured senior faculty sympathize with the junior faculty members and that the department was considering reducing their teaching loads. But deßary said reducing the teaching loads of the junior faculty members of the English department could pose serious problems for the core curriculum. ""Everyone wants a reduced teaching load. It affects the whole nature of the core curriculum and whether it is sustainable."" To Ferrante's claim that the junior faculty feel uncomfortable because of their lack of experience with the text, commission members countered that Core Curriculum preceptors are not expected to be experts on the texts, but should be exploring the books with the students for the maximum benefit to both. Professor of History J. W. Smit asserted that if faculty members taught only in their area of expertise, most would be qualified to just teach small, graduate-level seminars. Smit said he sees ""small specialty networks"" developing, a phenomenon which he argued is at odds with ""Columbia's mission to provide students with a liberal and general education."" Defending Columbia College's policy that has junior faculty teaching Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal said that individual departments, when hiring new faculty, must explain, ""We believe in this. We support the enterprise [of teaching the core curriculum]. We want the best people for whom it is a perfectly reasonable enterprise to teach."" Hanning retorted that the dissatisfaction isnot the result of the English department's hiring practices, adding, ""If the English department does not have some collective enthusiasm [for teaching this course], I don't see it as fault in the hiring of the English department. We do have to stop and consider where general education is or should be today. No core or educational policy is written in stone. Institutions change and grow."" Hanning also said that many junior faculty may be reluctant to directly express their discontent to the commission because they believe the group is not open to radical suggestions. Although deßary said that meetings with the Lit Hum staff have been held, and that none of these complaints were raised at those meetings, Hanning urged the commission to arrange another session to discuss the problems. The commission will define and discuss the proposal for an ""extended core"" at its next meeting at noon on December 1 in the Heyman Center for the Humanities. Deßary said this session will focus on whether or not to expand the major cultures requirement to include major contemporary issues. Hanning said after the meeting that he will encourage all junior faculty members in the English department to attend the next meeting. He added that he understood the extended core may include and expand the major cultures requirement and introduce contemporary problems, such as questions of gender and race, and that many junior faculty members have expressed interest in teaching such courses instead of Lit Hum.DEEP IN CONTEMPLATION: Yesterday was the last day to drop a course. Guess you'd better start thinking about those finals."
110,Debary report reaffirms core's Western emphasis,2 December 1988,"By Jonathan Earle and Melissa MichelsonAfter a year of deliberations, the commission conducting a review of the Columbia College core curriculum released its preliminary findings yesterday, reaffirming the current core and its emphasis on Western culture. The Commission on the Core Curriculum also recommended the creation of an ""extended core"" which would examine ""major problems of contemporary civilization that are of global scope and significance."" These issues should be studied in the same manner as in current Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and Contemporary Civilization (CC) courses, according to the report. In addition, the commisssion proposed the establishment of a Standing Committee on Core Curriculum to report regularly to the Columbia College faculty on the state of the core. ""We've reached a stage in the life of the college where the needs of the core can only be met with a standing committee of college faculty,"" said commission Chair Theodore deßary,John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University. The report released yesterday is a draft and must receive final approval before implementation, deßary emphasized. The faculty is scheduled to discuss the report on December 19. The commission was created by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack last February. Pollack could not be reached for comment on thecommission's recommendations last night. ""I'm hoping the faculty will vote to endorse the report and [its] recommendations in general,"" deßary said. He expects the body to accept the commission's work, although, he said, several opposing points of view were voiced at commission meetings. However, the group reached general agreement, he said. ""I sensed we have reached a considerable consensus as a commission,"" deßary said. The commision's recommendations are divided into those addressed to the faculty and those directed toward the University administration. The report suggests the faculty create the standing committee to review the existing core, create new courses for the extended core, and recommend awards to faculty and teaching teams who distinguish themselves in teaching core courses. However, the extended core should avoid focusing on paticular cultures or religions, and instead emphasizing common themes and pro-blems, to the report proposes. ""This approach would minimize any element of ethnic self-assertion, ideological special interest or minority advocacy partaking of a politicized struggle that could turn the curriculum into a jungle of educational conflict and competition. ""A core couse should approximate a multicultural forum, rather than serve as a platform or pulpit for the promotion of a particular ideology or religion,"" the report reads. Deßary explained that the extended core was designed as an adaptation of the new major cultures requirement, which was implemented last February as an interim replacement of the remoteness requirement. ""It's designed to include courses that might be taken among major cultures courses or under the new heading of major problems of civilization,"" deßary said. He added the requirement's title ""major cultures"" requirement would probably be changed to a ""second stage"" of CC or ""the extended core."" ""The number of required courses will re-main the same—we're looking to increase the options for fulfilling the six-point requirement,"" deßary said. The commission report urges the administration to demonstrate a commitment to the core through the recruitment, promotion and deployment of faculty. ""It's going to cost some money,"" deßary said of the ""If we had one million [of the $600 million the University raised during its recent capital campaign] we could have done wonders."" But deßary said he believes the arguments presented in the report are so strong that the administration will accept its recommendations regardless of cost. ""I believe that we define issues so clearly that they'd be embarassed not to listen,"" he said. Specifically, the report recommends that the present Lit Hum and CC formats and their focus on Western texts be maintained. In the case of Lit Hum, the report proposes that individual professors be allowed to choosebetween teaching only pre-19th century texts, or including later works. Optional, supplementary lectures should be offered by experts on certain Lit Hum texts and more senior faculty should teach the course, the report recommends. ' 'Some of the younger teachers feel that their elders sing the praises of the course, but let their younger colleagues do the work; it is an exaggeration to put it this way, but there is more to this perception than there should be,"" the report reads. Despite the importance of other world cultures, the report reaffirms the need for CC to ""address the rise of civilization in its Western forms before proceeding to an examination of other major civilizations,"" which should be addressed in the extended core. The report also urges the faculty to readopt the Chamberlain leave program for CC preceptors—one year paid leaves-of-absence upon completion of two years of teachingwhile instituting a training program for new preceptors in order to strengthen staff spirit.Theodore deßary"
111,"Rosenthal to resign as associate dean, return to English dept.",23 January 1989,"By Evan SchultzAfter serving as associate dean of Columbia College for 16 years, Michael Rosenthal will resign the post to return to the English department as a tenured professor beginning next year.His decision to return to the English Department is not a sudden one, he said. ""I never saw myself as an administrator forever. But there was no dramatic moment where I said I wanted to stop. The opportunity presented itself and I want to spend the next part of my career teaching."" he said. Rosenthal's accomplishments as associate dean include the founding of the Oxtord-Cambridge program, the implementation of the AfricanAmerican Studies major, of the Women s Studies major, and of coeducation of Columbia College, and, most recently, service on the deßary Commission on the Core Curriculum. ""I have been part of the growth and health of Columbia and am proud to be a part of it. My sense is that 1 played a role in all of it and haven'tdone it by myself,"" Rosenthal said. The associate dean is responsible for the school's academic program: dealing with the academic departments, writing and publishing Columbia College's edition of the Bulletin, and overseeing the John Jay Scholar's program and the Oxford-Cambridge program. ""I would say that he is 'Mr. Curriculum,' "" Columbia College Dean Robert Pollack said of Rosenthal. Rosenthal said he has enjoyed meeting people from many different parts of the University. ""I dealt with the larger world of alumni and with a large number of students who I would not find in my English course,"" he said. However, he said that the job of an administrator is tougher at colleges like Columbia that are divisions of universities, because such schools cannot make and act on their own decisions immediately. ""Columbia College can only call a few of its own shots. This is not a small freestanding college like Amherst or Swarthmore,"" he said. As a result, he added, he spent a lot of effort planning strategies to get resources from the University instead of in other capacitiesefforts he said he would not miss. Rosenthal's opportunity to work as an administrator arose in 1972, when Peter Pouncey, the previous associate dean, was promoted to dean of Columbia College, opening up the slot. Rosenthal had some administrative experience from his position as director of the Logic and Rhetoric program, he said, so he got the job. ""I stumbled onto administration on a whim,"" Rosenthal said, adding that he stayed on because ""obviously I found the job interesting."" During Rosenthal's tenure as associate dean, two new deans of Columbia College were appointed: Arnold Collery, now chair of the economics department, and current Dean Robert Pollack. Rosenthal refused to comment on whether he felt he had been passed over when Collery and Pollack were made deans. Rosenthal said administrators who also serve as faculty members gain valuable insight intoboth roles that helps them to solve problems more easily. ""I think it's healthy that administrators remain professors. Ideally [there should be a] certain fluid movement between administrators and faculty that like to have things run well,"" he said. After graduating from Harvard College and getting his Master's Degree from the University of Wisconsin, Rosenthal came to Columbia as a graduate preceptor in the English department, and eventually became an assistant professor. His area of interest is late 19thcentury and early 20th-century Great Britain. While full-time in the English Department, Rosenthal taught Literature Humanities and a course on the Bloomsbury writers, both of which he hopes to teach next year. However, Rosenthal's academic work did not languish in the dean's office. Since starting the job, he has written two books: The Character Factory, an examination of the British Boy Scouts, and Virginia Woolf, an analysis of the author and her writings. He said he plans to work on other projects, but has not yet decided what they will be. George Delacorte Professor of English and Comparative Literature Steven Marcus, formerly department chair, said it is not unusual for tenure to be given to someone who has not been a full-time teacher fora period of time. ""Hp's by no means been out of the classroom,"" Marcus said of Rosenthal. ""People are moving back and forth between departments all the time. This is not unusual."" Rosenthal said faculty should avoid backseat deaning. ""It can be an engaging faculty sport to complain about the way things are run. They should try their hand. When you've been an administrator you bring back a different perspective,"" he said. Pollack said that Rosenthal has helped the college in many roles. ""He covered the full range. He's not a man whose dedication to the college was limited,"" he said.Michael Rosenthal"
112,"Faculty, admins praise core curriculum report",27 January 1989,"By Evan Paul SchultzThe report released in December by the committee that reviewed Columbia College's core curriculum reaffirms the school's dedication to general education in both Western and non-Western areas, faculty and administrators said. The Commission on Core Curriculum, which was chaired by William Theodore deßary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, was created in February, 1988 by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack. The committee's report did not suggest major changes for Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), Music Humanities, or Art Humanities. But the committee did recommend reform in areas of non-Western and modern traditions, through the creation of an ""extended core"" which would examine ""major problems of contemporary civilization that are of global scope and significance."" These issues should be studied in the same manner as in current Lit Hum and CC courses, the report said. According to the report, the extended core should avoid focusing onparticular cultures or religions, and instead emphasize common themes and problems, to ""minimize any element of ethnic self-assertion, ideological special interest, or minority advocacy partaking of a politicized struggle that could turn the curriculum into a jungle of educational conflict and competition."" ""A core course should approx-imate a multi-cultural forum, rather than serve as a platform or pulpit for the promotion of a particular ideology or religion,"" the report reads. In addition, the committee proposed the establishment of a Standing Committee on Core Curriculum to report regulary to the Columbia College faculty on the state of the core. Assistant Professor of East Asian Studies Paul Anderer, a member of the committee, called the creation of the standing committee the ""heart and soul"" of the report. The core commission strongly advocated revamped staffing procedures in the core courses, including the reinstitution of the Chamberlain leave program for CC preceptors—a paid one-year leave of absence awarded upon the completion of three years of teaching—and granting special consideration to preceptors and assistant professors who apply for promotion or tenure in their departments. Pollack, who said he was ""indebted"" to the commission fora ""realistic,"" report, said that Columbia College could not independently implement all of the committee's recommendations. ""Recommendations made which cover issues of resources and academic priorities and department staffing patterns cannot be solvedin Columbia College. They must be confirmed by [the] arts and sciences [division of the University] as a whole,"" he said. Pollack said he will ask the Columbia College faculty by next month to change the bylaws of the faculty Standing Committee. I will do what I can to be sure whatever needs [the commission calls for] will be fulfilled respective to the college so we will be able to meet the challenges so clearly posed in the commission report,"" Pollack said. Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal, a member of the committee, said the commitee's report voices the general agreement of its members, but that he ""[doesn't] agree with everything. No one does with a consensus report."" The Standing Committee would deal with the actual restructuring of the core, Rosenthal added. Chair of the Contemporary Civilization department and Professor of History Ainslee Embree, who served on the core review committee, said the report could have placed more emphasis on non-Western cultures. ""I would have preferred to see [the report] more clearly focused on non-Western traditions. In the present suggested form it may be too distributional and similar to the old remoteness requirement,"" Embree said.Columbia College's remoteness requirement, under which students take six points in areas outside their major or courses related to their major, was replaced by the requirement that students take six points in courses dealing with major cultures ""not covered adequately by the core."" Embree said he felt the committee made valid pedalogical arguments for maintaining the Western emphasis. The report suggests that by limiting material to Western traditions in courses like Lit Hum and CC, students will undergo ""an examination of their own mental furniture,"" before moving on to the non-Western works to be covered in the extended core. Anderer, an assistant professor of East Asian Studies, said he would have preferred more non-Western texts integrated into Lit Hum and CC, but maintained that the report's value lay in reaffirming the faculty's interest in teaching general education core courses. ' 'What the committee tried to do was see if the faculty remained committed to teaching general education courses of any kind, either Western or non-Western,"" he said. The opportunity still exists to study nonWestern cultures in the ""second tier"" of the extended core, which would include a greater number of electives than the current core,Anderer said. Robert Belknap, Chair of the Lit Hum department and professor of Russian Language and Literature, said he thought the report left much for the standing committee to accomplish. ""The report specified certain things, while it decided to delegate others to the standing committee. The report is demanding some commitment from the entire University. The report itself won't do a thing,"" he said. Belknap said he approved of placing nonWestern cultures in the extended core. ""That's definitely where they belong. I'd hate to see amateurs like me trying to do justice to those things which are beyond our expertise. I can do a half-way decent job with Greek literature, but not for Indian,"" he said. Wallace Gray, professor of English and Comparitive Literature, who has taught Lit Hum since 1963 and has published a book on the texts read in the course, said he strongly agrees with committee's stress on Western traditions. ""I support the notion that in order to be an educated student you must read Western works which have influenced all cultures,"" he said. Gray said he favors the extended core over the addition of non-Western texts to the core curriculum, where reading one non-Western book would, he said, amount to tokenism.Robert Pollack"
113,Profs say major cultures classes crowded,1 February 1989,"By Evan Paul SchultzTo fulfill the semester-old Major Cultures requirement, students have this semester begun flocking to many courses with traditionally low enrollments, confronting professors—many for the first time—with unwieldy classes. The Major Cultures requirement—six credits dealing with cultures ""not covered adequately by the core""—replaced the Remoteness Requirement last fall. The Remoteness Requirement called for students to take six points in courses outside their major or courses related to their major. Overcrowding did not occur widely last term because not as many courses on the major cultures list were offered last term, said Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALAC) Pauline Yu, Columbia College representative to the EALAC program. Professor Paul Varley, chair of the EALAC Department, said hisdepartment will hold a meeting Thursday to discuss the overcrowding problem. Varley said he will ask Vice President of Arts and Sciences Jonathan Cole for funding to supply more teaching assistants later this week, but that he does not expect Cole to approve funding for more professors. Another way to ease the burden overcrowding lays on professors' shoulders may be more standardized tests, such as multiple choice, which require less time to grade, he added. ""I must say that if you come to Columbia University, you expect something other than one class after another of 65 to 85 students,"" he said. Enrollment in EALAC courses had begun to increase before the Major Cultures requirement was initiated, Varley said, but the requirement boosted it.""Enrollment has gone up steadily for the past five to six years. Columbia University is a tremendous center for East Asian studies. It is one of the best departments as East Asian enrollment has gone up for obvious reasons,"" he said. ""People are hanging out the windows. We don't have the rooms. It is not the Columbia experience to have 80 students in what should be a discussion course,"" Yu said. The department had expected enrollment to increase with the advent of the Major Cultures requirement, but the size of the increase was a surprise. ""We had no idea how serious it would be,"" Yu said. The problem of over-enrollment was not adequately discussed by the Columbia College Committee on Instruction when the Major Cultures requirement was under consideration, according to Director of theMiddle East Institute and Chair of the Anthropology Department Professor Richard Bulliet. ""This was not a supposed outcome of the decision. The people in the East Asian Department were very apprehensive, but no one else seemed to concentrate on the overcrowdedness. The list was large and I don't think that people thought there would be clustering [of students] in the list,"" Bulliet said. He added that he saw no problem with teaching larger classes as long as rooms could be found to accomodate the swelled enrollment. ""Political science teachers have taught over 100 students on a regular basis. For any professor to adjust to the increased enrollment can be disconcerting fora few weeks but it is not a long term problem,"" Bulliet said. Many of the overcrowded classes were not originally meant to allow for discussion, although some classes with lower enrollment did allow some interchange, he added. Professor of History William Roff, who taught a course on South East Asia in the 20th century last semester, said he was delighted by the increase of 25 students in his class, but the quality of student-faculty realtions will suffer as a result. He is experiencing similar increases in his course this semester, he said. ""There are too many from the point of view of the student because we don't have the same lattitude for individual papers. It is also difficult to get discussion in a group that size, though it is not impossible,"" Roff said.The administration should provide teaching assistants for the grading of exams and tests, he said. Circulation at the East Asian Library has doubled or tripled recently, according to library desk attendant Alex Brown, CC '87. ""I did work in here before this [the Major Cultures requirement] was instituted. I remember the library with a different character—quiet and empty. Now it's always chock full of people,"" Brown said. Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal could not be reached for comment. The committee to review the core curriculum chaired by William Theodore de Bary, John Mason Mitchell Professor of the University, suggested in its report last December the creation of an ""extended core"" to address nonWestern and modern areas which are not covered in the current core. These courses are to be taught in a general education manner similar to the seminar style of Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities. The extended core, which will replace the major culture requirement, will be implemented by a Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum which Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack has said he will form later this month. The art history department hired a new instructor to teach half of the approximately 50 students enrolled in the Oriental Humanities course taught by Elizabeth Weiland, a lecturer in art history, according to Lisa Cohen, CC '90, a student in the class."
114,Comment Course inconsistency causes core curriculum catastrophe,1 February 1989,"Course inconsistency causes core curriculum catastropheAnother January, another stroll down the corridor of Philosophy Hall. We all know the feeling of frantically searching for the computer printouts of our classes. Cautiously we run our finger down the sheet until our social security number appears. There it is: your grade. I personally am fascinated by grades. In fact, I don't just look at my own grades, I look at every grade in every class. I start at Accounting and keep perusing until I finish with Yiddish.While it may seem bizarre and disturbed, this ritual is ultimately insightful. Having examined grades for three years, I have learned there is great variance in grading between different sections of Columbia College core curriculum classes. Grade distributions generally vary from department to department, and from class to class. Some departments or classes have mostly high grades, while others do not. Either all the smart people take the same classes, or some classes are easier than others. I incline toward the latter. For most subjects this does not jose a problem, as people who choose a particular course know what they're getting into. For some, difficulty of a class does not matter as long as the subject is interesting. For others— especially masochists and lazy students— difficulty of a class is of great importance in deciding whether or not to take it. Where students have freedom to pick aspecific class, it is of no real importance that some are easier than others. Unfortunately, the area in which this choice does not exist happens to be one that is integral to the Columbia undergraduate educational experience: the core curriculum. We are led to believe that the core curriculum is meant to unify Columbia College students by providing them with a commoneducational base. Ideally, once we all drink from this common spring, we then can then diversify—complementing a broad base with the major electives of choice. However, the base is uniform neither in content nor in workload. The only truly unifying aspect of the core curriculum is that most students bond together in opposition to it. The classes in the core—LiteratureHumanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art and Music Humanities, and English—do not appear to be standardized. Anyone who has taken these ""automated sectioning"" classes know that emphasis and workload vary significantly. There is a clear disparity between core intent and core content. Each instructor intends to teach the same subject, but this results in 25 distinct classes with different syllabi, requirements, and grading standards. Consider my Contemporary Civilization class. While students in other sections basked in the simplicity of their respective requirements, my class sat dazed as the instructor outlined the course, assigning paper after paper. At the end of the semester, the final tally came to ten papers—in addition to the midterm and final exams. He gave one A grade. It wasn't mine. It is not unreasonable to require this much work fora four-point course, but it is clearly unfair that instructors of other sections assign one-quarter as much work. To ice the cake of injustice, these easygoing educators even award higher grades. Of all the core courses, Literature Humanities is the only one which implements a standard finaTexam. While it is expected that instructors will always vary in grade leniency, regulating course requirements would at least help to equalize these allegedly ""core"" courses. As long as discrepancies exist between core sections, students should be allowed to make informed choices regarding which core classthey will enroll in. In Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization this is usually possible. Since the sectioning forms list the names of the instructors, students can find out who many of them are. Nevertheless, this is generally only true for the professors, while the graduate student teachers often remain a mystery. The real crime is the randomness of Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and English. Anyone who takes these classes learns that one's grade is largely determined by the computer in Philosophy Hall that places the student in a specific section. These classes are supposed to be the same from section to section, but they are not. The worst offenders are the English 1007 composition instructors. Though the workload is fairly consistent, the demands are completely inconsistent. Some of the instructors give out mostly Cs, while some give out mostly Bs or As. Unlike Art and Music Humanities, one generally cannot drop these classes even ifplaced in a lousy section. Sectioning for these requirements is more like playing Lotto than selecting a class. If section diversity is to be maintained, it is imperative that the University provide the same information about different core classes as they do about other courses. All this would require is a little more paperwork and computertime for the University. With so much fairness to be gained, this extra burden seems a small price to pay. The core curriculum exists because the school believes certain subjects are important enough to be required. Labeling these courses as ""core"" infers that everyone will learn essentially the same information. It should also mean that the same demands are expected of all students. If these courses are so important, they should be truly standardized so that everyone has an equal opportunity to learn and benefit from them. As of now, the core curriculum fails to meet this crucial standard.Jeff Rake is a Columbia College junior.Rake's progress Jeff Rake"
115,Sentimental education,3 February 1989,"To the Editor: In his column (Spectator, Feb. 1), Mr. Jeff Rake calls for the standardization of syllabi and exams for all Columbia core courses. To justify it, he cites a ""great variance in grading and workload of the core courses. Mr. Rake's argument seems at best misguided and at worst potential for disastrous policy. Every teacher is naturally different. Give a 112 teacher the freedom to emphasize how and what he or she wants to teach, and the teacher can teach with energy and excitement, creating a better education for everyone. When you take away that leeway, subjecting the teachers to an oppressively specific curriculum and standard final exam (written by someone presumably more qualified to judge the students than their teacher), you invariably subject students to teachers who are resentful of their chains and thus not very happy to be there. Unhappy teachers mean poorer education. [ Furthermore, diversity allows for develop- ' ment of curriculum and teaching technique. If departments don't allow a teacher to experiement, how can they ever learn what works and what doesn't? How will departments ever know how to improve courses? Could Mr. Rake possibly think we can have core courses that are not only standardized, but perfect? The real problem is not the disparity, but the lack of information students have for wisely choosing course sections. Except for Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, students can never know who's teaching what. The result: ""slot-machine"" course selection. If the problem is lack of information, then the solution is simple: provide more information. The registration packet should list all teachers of all sectioned classes. The Columbia Course Guide should then evaluate every teacher of every class, where possible. And the students should fill out the evaluation forms them, and take them more seriously. Finally, let us keep a handle on what core courses are for. They were not created so that today s Columbia students can someday meet at a cocktail party, clink glasses and laugh about Machiavellian doctrine. Columbia Col-lege's core curriculum was created to give us all a minimum understanding of our societywhile exposing us to different views of the world —and to further options for study, something which diverse, quality teaching can only help. When looking to improve our school, we must never lose focus on that which we're trying to improve: the education of the students. David Y. Hazony, CC '92"
116,Letters Core faculty need freedom,13 February 1989,"Core faculty need freedomTo the Editor: After reading Jeff Rake's ""Course Inconsistency Causes Core Curriculum Catastrophe"" (Spectator, Feb. 1), I was moved to do something I haven't done in years: respond to a Spectator column. As an instructor who has taught both Logic and Rhetoric and Literature Humanities, I also have been bothered by the inequality of grades and workload across course sections. From the instructor's perspective, however, I can attest that in Logic and Rhetoric the administration makes a concerted e/fort to even out such discrepancies. Grading sessions are for all incoming teachers with sample papers, discussions on what constitutes an A, a B, and so on. The workload, as defined by the syllabus, is supposed to be approximately two short papers a week. To a lesser but still real degree, the Literature Humanities staff also tries for internal consistency. ♦ What happens next is that the teachers go their separate ways. Some of the discrepancies arise from individual teaching style, taste, and judgement, which is understandable. Other differences, however, are far more willful. Some teachers are content to assign less, since less work for the students usually means less work for the teacher. In grading, a teacher may win popularity but not respect for giving out high grades, sincestudents may regard the teacher as an easy mark. The department's usual response when hit with such complaints is to conduct a little investigation, possibly issue a reprimand or two, and then step back. The general feeling is that it's hard enough to teach without having the administration breathing down one's neck. Invoke the word ""policy,"" and some people will accuse you of McCarthyism and cutting down on academic freedom. Somewhere in this sea _ between strict adherence to a mythical standard and absolute liberty is a happy mean, but it hasn't been nailed down yet. For better and worse, teaching remains an art, not a science. David Galef Preceptor, English department"
117,Prez tells students he longs to teach,21 February 1989,"By Robert Hardt, Jr.About 25 students gathered last night in suite 9B of Wallach Hall to dine with University PresidentMichael Sovern and his wife, Joan. Resident Professor of Applied Physics and Nuclear Engineering Chia-Kun Chu played host fora night to Wallach residents, giving them a chance to chat with the president at one of the rare informal events with undergraduates he fits into his schedule. Before dinner, students snacked on crackers and cheese and drank soda from plastic cups. Sovern —who drank from a glass—was encircled by a group of curious students. Over a meal of shish-ke-bab and rice, Sovern spoke on subjects ranging from the core curriculum to playing stickball in the South Bronx as a youth. Sovern recalled that as a Col-umbia College first-year student he was soundly defeated in the election for class president. Also, Sovern claimed credit for the idea behind a famous cartoon that appeared in the Jester and Time magazine that satirized behavioralist experiments with rats. Sovern said he enjoyed taking courses in the core curriculum as an undergraduate and said he harbors a secret desire to teach Contemporary Civilization or Literature Humanities after he retires from the presidency. Sovern, 57, also recollected with fondness that he had taken a history course with Professor James Shenton who still teaches undergraduates.One student asked Sovern what he thought about the tenure system. Sovern replied that the tenure process was good at Columbia but could place more emphasis on the quality of candidates' teaching skills. But, said Sovern, who received tenure from the law school when he was only 28, good teaching should never become the sole basis for getting tenure. When asked about the football team, Sovern said he had not received complaints from alumni about the team's 44 game losing streak. Only after the season ended and allegations surfaced about Head Coach Larry McElreavy's personal life, Sovern said, did alumni complain to him. The University handled the subsequent scandal very well, said Sovern, who also expressed confidence in McElreavy's replacement, Ray Tellier. Sovern said he enjoys waking up every morning and thinking about going to work. A favorite aspect of his job, he said, was receiving donations from alumni because they are so praiseworthy of him and of Columbia. Sovern emphasized the importance of hislobbying state legislators and Washington congressmen to secure Columbia's interests, recalling two specific incidents in which he felt his lobbying made a difference. In one instance, a state legislator, a former student of Sovern's, was going to cast a vote on a crucial bill, Sovern said. Sovern said he telephoned the legislator to make sure he was going to vote the way Sovern desired. In the other case, Sovern recalled speaking about federal aid to a sympathetic Senator Mark Hatfield (R-Oregon). Sovern said he was opposed, however, to the idea of Columbia establishing a Political Action Committee (PAC) to donate money to certain candidates. Sovern expressed concern in the sudden drop of applications to Columbia College but said that it is part of an Ivy-League-wide trend this year. The president speculated that high school students are more doubtful that they will be accepted by Ivy League schools and therefore less likely to apply. Sovern told the students that he had no idea when he will leave his job. He has been president since 1980.Michael Sovern"
118,CC faculty approves core committee,28 February 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzA new standing committee charged with reshaping and monitoring Columbia College's core curriculum was unanimously approved by the Columbia College faculty last week. The new standing committee will use the de Bary commission report on the core submitted in December as a blueprint for its work, according to standing committee chair Jacob Smit, professor of history. A committee to review the core curriculum, chaired by Theodore de Bary, John Mitchell Mason professor of the University, was established by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack last year. The commission's final report call-ed for an ""extended core"" to cover non-Western cultures and committment by the Columbia College and the University to the core. It also called for the establishment of the standing committee to review the core curriculum continuously. Smit said the report left considerable room for discussion. The committee's first responsibility will be to set up the structure of the ""extended core"" because of problems facing the current major cultures requirement. ""There are practical reasons to devote most of our energies to the extended core because the major cultures requirement has led to over-subscription of many courses,"" Smit said. The two-semester major cultures requirement was instituted last semester to ensure that students take courses dealing with non-Western cultures. Many teachers of thecourses reported problems of overcrowding last month. The major cultures requirement has the added problem of not including general education courses, he said. ""For the time being it uses all types of courses in non-Western cultures, but the ideal would be to design courses to be logical developments of Contemporary Civilizations [CC] and Literature Humanities [Lit Hum] that would fit into the core ideal,"" Smit said. The faculty accepted all but one of the de Bary Commission's suggestions, rejecting only the call for the standing committe to ""assist the deans and department in the recruitment of new faculty and promotion of those now in service to insure that the instructional needs of the core curriculum are given due weight in the selection process."" ""What the recommendation would do is involve the commission in recruiting people for departments. The departmens want to be sovereign and don't want instructions from an alien source,"" Smit said. The faculty would not have accepted the de Bary report without the deletion, according to Professor of English and comparative literature Joan Ferrante. The elimination of the recruiting stipulation will not hamstring the standing committee, according to Paul Anderer, associate professor of East Asian Languages and cultures. However, Smit may find it necessary to reinstate the recommendation, or something similar to it, according to Anderer. The controversial stipulation is unnecessary because departments already recruit people who are interested in teaching core classes, Pollack said. Smit said he would push fora reinstatement of the Chamberlain fellowships, paid year-long leaves of absence granted to CC preceptors after two years of teaching, which wereeliminated three years ago. ""Preceptors sacrifice a lot. The first year [of teaching] they are not capable of working on their dissertations so they deserve something like Chamberlain leave for time sacrificed on their career goals,"" he said. The standing committee will hold its first meeting within two weeks, Smit said. Smit added that he envisions a core curriculum which deals with issues that cast light on current events. ""The reading list in the core curriculum should be consistent with contemporary problems on an abstract level. It shouldn't be a canon,"" he said. The charter for the committee will expire at the end of the term, pending the faculty's reaction to a report on science education at Columbia College, Pollack said. The committee to review the science requirement has completed its final report and given it to Pollack, but he has not yet responded to it, he said. The faculty may instruct the standing committee to review the recommendations of the science report, Pollack said. Standing committee members include four tenured professors, two assistant professors, the directors of CC, Lit Hum, Art Humanities and Music Humanities, the director of the Heyman Center for the Humanities, and two students, to be nominated by the Academic Affairs subcommittee of the Columbia College Student Council and approved by Pollack, according to Smit. More members will be added to deal with specific problems as they arise, he said. The student members have not been chosen because Pollack has yet to notify the academic affairs committee of the creation of the standing committee, according to academic affairs Committee Chair Jane Murphy, CC '89.Jacob Smit"
119,Standing Committee on the core discuss proposed 'extended core',24 March 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzColumbia College's new standing Committee on the Core Curriculum began its task of shaping the ""extended core,"" the set of courses that will eventually replace the Major Cultures requirement, according to History Professor Jacob Smit, chair of the committee. The committee decided that the two semester extended core, which was proposed last fall in a report from a committee commissioned to evaluate the core curriculum, should encompass both major cultures of the world and important contemporary issues of the day, Smit said. The commission on the core curriculum was chaired by John Mitchell Professor of the University Ted deßary. Students will be required to fulfill one semester of the extended core in a major cultures class, Smit said. ""[For the second semester of the requirement], students will be free to either continuewith major cultures or to take the second semester in contemporary issues and problems,"" he said. The committee also decided that classes which fulfull the extended core requirement should be limited to 40 students, which the committee sees as the largest size capable of supporting a discussion, Smit said. ""We held onto the idea of the format of the extended core as discussion, but because the courses will not be like Contemporary Civilization or [Literature] Humanities, the format will allow a mix of lecture and discussion,"" Smit said, adding that the 40 student maximum was ""ideally what, we should target."" The committee will define a ""working definition"" of extended core classes at next week's meeting, Smit said."
120,Student theater groups want control of Schapiro Theater,29 March 1989,"By Jonathan RossThree undergraduate theater groups have joined forces in an effort to put Schapiro Theater under student control, according to group members. Schapiro Theater is still under construction and is scheduled to open in September. Members of the newly formed Columbia Theater Network (CTN), drawn from the Columbia Players, Columbia Courtiers, and the Columbia Musical Theater Society, said they hope to increase support for undergraduate theater from Colum-bia College administrators. The previous lack of interaction between groups has stymied the growth of undergraduate theater at Columbia, according to CTN members. The creation of the network will force administrators ""to accept theater as a viable academic resource and therefore make a serious committment to its pursuit and development,"" said CTN founder Ehren Fordyce, CC '90, a member of the Courtiers.Because theater traditionally has been characterized as non-academic, the administration has failed to support it, according to CTN founder Seth Goldstein, CC '92, Courtiers president-elect. ""Columbia has no undergraduate theater department, no theater major, and no specific theater space devoted to undergraduate production,"" Goldstein said. Schapiro Theater's opening offers a chance to promote lagging administrative interest in undergraduate theater, he said. Schapiro Theater is the ideal space for undergraduate production and should be eserved for just that purpose, according to CTN and Courtiers member Sharon Nacol, CC '92. If given the opportunity to run Schapiro Theater, CTN would reserve the space solely for the performing arts and its related pursuits, in contrast to Wollman Auditorium, where many theatre groups now practice and perform, and which has in the past hosted a variety of non-theatrical events such as weddings, roller skating parties, and ""souvlaki sales,"" Nacol said. This diverse use detracts from a unified image of theater at Columbia, she said. The CTN is better qualified to run the theater than the Office of Student Activities, which currently allocates available theater space, Goldstein said. ""Theater at Columbia should be run bythose who know and love it,"" Nacol said. Student Activities Officials are insensitive to the needs of undergraduate theater, Goldstein said. Last year, a production in the 'Plex was marred by noise when poor planning scheduled a Del Fuegos concert directly above it in Wollman Auditorium, he said. Such snafus would not occur in a student-run Schapiro Theater, Goldstein said. Peter Smith, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts, praised the group's efforts. CTN can address the issue of Columbia's deovtion of resources to undergraduate theatrical production and education. ""There is no easy answer as to why Columbia does not commit itself,"" Smith said. ""But I believe that the efforts of Goldstein and CTN will at least begin to unearth the solution or at most remedy the problem."" CTN hopes to convince the administration to give the student group creative and administrative control over the new theater space by stressing theater's academic aspects, Goldstein said. CTN has proposed a ""Schapiro Classic""— an annual classical production of a work on the Literature Humanities syllabus, and a Spring Consortium of all the undergraduate theater groups from around the Ivy League, he said."
121,"Students honor Jackson, Foner at awards dinner",14 April 1989,"By Jeremy BuchmanApproximately 250 students, ■acuity and other members of the Columbia community gathered at Acuity House last night to honor history professors Eric Foner and enneth Jackson, winners of the Lionel Trilling and Mark Van Doren \wards. The dinner and awards ceremony, resented by the Academic Awards Jmnuttee of Columbia College Stujlent Council (CCSC), was held to recognize Foner, DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History, as winner of the 14th annual Lionel Trilling Award, and Jackson, MellonProfessor of Social Sciences, as winner of the 28th annual Mark Van Doren Award. The Lionel Trilling Award is given to the professor who publishes the most important work in the past calendar year, according to Joe Regal, CC'9O, chair of the Academic Awards Committee. Foner won the award for his book Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution. 1863-1877. Foner's book has won the Los Angeles Times Book Award for history and has been nominated for the National Book Award, theNational Book Critics' Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize. The Mark Van Doren Award is given to the professor ""who best exemplifies the virtues of leadership, humanity, and devotion to truth,"" Regal said. The Lionel Trilling Award is named after the late Professor of English, an esteemed authority on literature and founder of the Literature Humanities course, while the Mark Van Doren Award is named after the popular Shakespeare scholar. Foner said that the Trilling Award ""gives me particular pleasure because it does come from the students,"" and because it rewards both writing and teaching, which he describes as ""intimately connected with one another."" The necessity of presenting your ideas to students . . .actually does make you a better writer and a better historian,"" Foner said. According to Foner, his father, also an historian, taught him that ""there's no contradiction between political belief and the writing of history."" Foner also thanked his wife and History Professor James Shenton, in whose class he first became interested in Civil War and the Reconstruction era, for their help and insperation. ""The writing of history does make a difference, whether for good or evil. It is not a purely academic exercise. These issues [presented by history] are still alive,"" Foner said. Jackson, in his acceptance speech, thanked his colleagues, whom he said ""collectively . . .deserve the Mark Van Doren Award,"" and the students, who ""added meaning and richness to my life."" Jackson described three characteristics that he has tried to demonstrate while teaching: enthusiasm, affection for one's students and accessibility. He praised those teachers who em-phasize teaching over research: ""Such teachers deserve more than our respect and our admiration. They deserve jur support."" Foner's and Jackson's speeches were preceded by anecdotes and recollections from people who have worked with them. Shenton, who spoke on Foner's behalf, described his first contact with Foner, when the latter was an undergraduate at Columbia College, and how the two men's friendship has developed over the years to the point that Shenton now calls Foner the ""only person in the world I would trust with my life . . .the embodiment of friendship."" Penny Von Eschen, a graduate history student, talked about her experience in a graduate colloquium taught by Foner and her opportunity to witness Foner's ""deep engagement and passion for history."" ""What really stands out about Professor Foner is his deep political and philosophical concern"" on such issues as the rights of women, blacks and organized labor, Von Eschen said. Charles Preusse, CC' 90, said that ""there was one course that all upperclassmen told me I could not miss—History of the City of New York,"" taught by Jackson. Ray Weisman, a Ph.D. student in history, said Jackson displays ""clear intellect"" and ""ever-present humor,"" and he illustrated Jackson's relationship with students by describing the professor's proclivity for playing pick-up basketball in the gym with other students. According to Regal, the affair cost approximately $6,000, with most of the funds going toward the cost of the dinner. The remainder covered the costs of books to read in preparation to give the Van Doren Award, as well as postering, the awards themselves, and miscellaneous supplies, he said. The council funded the event, Regal said."
122,Guidelines set to evaluate classes for extended core,17 May 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzIn the first major step in converting the current Major Cultures requirement into an ""extended core curriculum,"" guidelines for extended core classes were approved earlier this month by the Columbia College Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum. The guidelines will be used to judge existing courses currently included in the Major Cultures requirement and to develop new courses, according to Committee Chair Jacob Smit, Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History. However, the current budget crunch facing the University will preclude any sweeping changes from occurring for at least two years, Smit said. Funding is needed to develop new courses and to hire new teachers,since many of the extended core classes will involve small departments, such as East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALAC), he said. The committee will also canvass funds from educational foundations to develop the new courses, Smit said. Until then, he said courses currently fulfilling the Major Cultures requirement will be evaluated according to the new guidelines, but new ones will not be created. The list for next semester's requirement should be completed in a few weeks, Smit said. A two-term extended core was proposed last semester by a commission created by Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack to review the core, which was chaired by JohnMitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary. The Standing Committee on the core was created by the faculty earlier this term to continually review the core, following another recommendation by the deßary commission. The Major Cultures requirement, which replaced the Remoteness Requirement last September, calls for all Columbia College students to take two approved courses in areas which address cultures outside the Western world. Many students have complained that the classes are too large and that the subjects covered are too specific. The new guidelines state that the extended core is ""meant to build on the work of the existing"" core classes, which include Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities, Art Humanities and Music Humanities, by ""enlarging the scope and inquiry beyond the primary Western focus . . . and extending their subject matter to include questions and problems of the contemporary world."" The guidelines state that all extended core courses must address either a non-Western culture or civilization, or a contemporaryissue, such as racism or environmental problems. Students will be required to take at least one civilization course, and can fulfill the second term of the extended core requirement with either an issues course or a civilization course, Smit said. The committee decided to emphasize the civilization aspect of the extended core to address what it saw as the core's biggest deficiency, Smit explained. The civilization courses will address material independent from Western tradition, although all cultures will be seen as interacting with each other, he said. ""We will be dealing with these things as Westerners trying to understand and respect the cultures on their own terms,"" Smit said. All of the courses ""should engage the students in the disputatious learning that the existing core tries to cultivate,"" according to the guidelines. Smit added that the committee recommends a 40-student cap on all extended core classes. The guidelines diminish the number of graduate courses which would be included in the list, Smit said.Classes with a majority of graduate students tend to get overly technical, thus undermining the general education emphasis and discussion which the extended core should embody, he said. ""Graduate level courses would not necessarily be excluded, but in general we do not want to approve courses in which there are a large number of graduate students, though a sprinkling is okay,"" Smit said. Committee members also discussed whether to include courses which teach defunct civilizations, according to committee member Professor of Art History and Archeology Richard Brilliant. Just as CC texts written 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece are relevant to modern society, other ancient civilizations may yield pertinent works and ideas, Brilliant explained. Smit said extinct cultures warrent examination, especially in the case of the Aztecs, since a large amount of modern Mexican culture is based on currents stemming from the ancient period. Dorsey Dunn, CC '91, one of two studenj representatives on the Standing Committee, said the contemporary issues courses wouldsatisfy student concerns that certain issues, such as gender and racial issues, be addressed. Smit said he was interested in student concerns and would talk to student representatives about concerns of the student body. In a related decision, the Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI) approved the deletion of a rule which called for students to take their Major Cultures classes in subject areas other than their major. Smit, who serves on the COI, said professors in EALAC complained that their students were put at a disadvantage because many of the Major Cultures courses are EALAC courses. Smit called the original distinction ""bureaucratic,"" and said the Standing Committee had concluded that ""there was no connection whatsoever between the two requirements,"" before relaying that decision to the COI. The decision will be applied retroactively, but only to those courses which are still on the list in the fall, Smit said.HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE: Student Senators Veena Sud, BC '89, and Warigia Bowman, CC '90, present University President Michael Sovern with Michael the pet rat."
123,CC core curriculum expands beyond west,30 August 1989,"By Evan P. SchultzIn response to criticism that the Columbia College Core Curriculum is eurocentric, sexist, and outdated, a new requirement encompassing courses on non-Western cultures, women, minoriries, and contemporary issues will go into effect this year. The new requirement and other aspects of the core will be constantly reviewed and modified by a new standing committee composed of Columbia College faculty members and students. The two semester ""extended core,' as it is called, requires all incoming students, as well as this year's sophmores and juniors, to take at least one course in a non-Western culture and the other course on either a second culture or a contemporary issue such as women's rights. The courses which satisfy the requirement are printed on a list available in the Registrar's office and the Dean of Student's office. The extended core replaces last years Major Cultures requirement, which required two semesters of study in an area other than Western culture. Complaints about the requirement were based on the lack of focus of the courses which fulfilled the requirement, and severe overcrowding in the classes. If students have already completed the Major Cultures requirement, they will not be responsible for the extended core. The standing committee defined the courses for the extended core by refining the Major Cultures requirement list. The committee also suggested a limit of40 students per class for extended core classes, though demand may overwhelm any such restriction. Additionally, according to the chair of the committee, Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History Jacob Smit, courses used for the extended core will also count for towards majors and concentrations, which was not the case for the major cultures requirement. The idea for an extended core came from a committee of professors commissioned by former Dean of Columbia College Robert Pollack to evaluate and make recommendations for the core. The commission, chaired by John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University Theodore deßary, reaffirmed the bulk of the core. The core still consists of the two semester sequences of Literature Humanities (Lit-Hum) and Contemporary Civilizations (CC), and one semester each of Music Humanities and Art Humanities. However, the commision did propose the extended core, as well as the formation of the standing committee. Though it has started to define the new requirement, the standing committee has yet to form the core of the extended core by developing new courses which use the seminar method of Lit Hum and CC. That will take time, money, and more money. Besides requiring funding for research, which Smit said he hopes to obtain from educational foundations, many new professors will need to be hired—both to deal with the new de-mand for courses which are taught from what have been small departments at Columbia and to accomodate the 40 student limit for the classes Since faculty members are hired through the departments, not by Columbia College, any approvals for mass hirings for the extended core will have to be approved by the central ad-ministration of the University. Not an easy task. Smit has said that it will be a few years before the new courses are developed and put into place. But the extended core, if all goes well, promises to address compelling modern thoughts and trends while allowing the continuation of the traditional core courses."
124,Broadway accident kills CC senior,7 September 1989,"By Robert Hardt Jr.A Columbia College senior, Adrienne G. Jones, died in St. Luke's Hospital on Aug. 29 after she was hit by a truck on Broadway and 115 th Street. Jones was the fourth Columbia College student to die since the end of the last school term. Jay Jardine,CC'92, Nina Saks, CC'92, and Catherine Choi, a Columbia College student on leave, died during the summer. Saks and Jardine died in automobile accidents. Police termed Choi's death an apparent suicide. Choi had been on leave from Columbia College for several years, according to Acting Dean of Students Karen Blank. Jones, 21, who had returned to campus early to be an orientation adviser, was crossing east on Broadway at about 9:15 a.m., according to Director of Security Dominick Moro. She stepped onto the street from behind a doubleparked Coca-Cola truck and was immediately struck by a southbound bakery van and thrown 71 feet, Moro said. The driver of the truck, Gustavo Carranza, did not see Jones until after his truck struck her, Moro said. Police have determined that the traffic light was green and that the truck's speed was about 20 miles perhour, within the 25 mile per hour speed limit, Moro said. No charges have been filed against Carranza, New York City police said. In the emergency room of St. Luke's, doctors struggled to revive Jones for hours but were unsuccessful, according to Director of Health Service and University Medical Officer Richard G. Carlson. At about 3:15 p.m., Jones died of mul-tiple head injuries, Carlson said. ""I think what happened was a genuine accident. It was just one of those things,"" Dean of Columbia College Jack Greenberg said. Dean of Students Roger Lehecka had met with Jones the day before she died and was scheduled to meet with her that Tuesday, Lehecka said. ""She was really excited about meeting her advisees on Wednesday,"" Lehecka said. ' 'The word that you would think of when you thought of her was alive, which makes the whole thing seem unbelievable.""Jones was a philosophy-economics major and a member of the Delta Gamma sorority, her mother, Sharon Jones, said. ""She was just wonderful. She had a smile that wouldn't fade for more than 15 seconds,"" Jones said. Sharon Jones said that her daughter ""wasn't the typically intense Columbia student. She had a wonderfully free spirit.'' She read from a letter written to the Jones family by Assistant Professor James Shapiro, who was Adrienne's Literature Humanities professor: ""She was a wonderful student and had a strong sense of self. She was a delight...lt was predictable that Adrienne would return early to help her fellow students...lt is hard to fathom why she was taken from us."" A memorial service for Jones will be held at 12:15 p.m. on Sept. 15 in St. Paul's Chapel. The Catholic Campus Ministry in conjunction with the Delta Gamma sorority is handling arrangements. Jones' death prompted Moro last week to write the New York City Department of Transportation and call for a meeting between transportation officials and University administrators to discuss the timing of the traffic lights on Broadway, Moro said. During orientation in 1986, two students were injured, one seriously, while crossing Broadway, and a law student was killed last year while crossing Broadway at 110 th Street. Making vehicles stop at every traffic light on Broadway near Columbia could make the street safer, Moro said. But, he added, requiring cars to accelerate and decelerate at every traffic light could cause more accidents. ""We need to meet and study the matter,"" Moro said. Three other Columbia College students died earlier this summer. Jardine died in Denville, N.J. on July 11 at 1 a.m. when the car he was driving rear-ended a tractor-trailer that was making an illegal U-turn.Jardine, 19, was a member of the wrestling team and the Beta Theta Phi fraternity. ""He was a face that will be missed because he was so outgoing,"" Ken Gaudreau, CC'B9, a co-captain of last year's wrestling team,said at the time of Jardine's death. ""Everyone enjoyed his presence. Hopefully, as a team we cannot forget but put it aside...not to disrupt us but to encourage us. That's how he would want it,"" Gaudreau said. Services for Jardine will be held at 3 p.m. on Sept. 13 in St. Paul's Chapel. Choi fell to her death from the 20th floor of the Westchester County Courthouse on July 20, police said. Westchester police said that Choi waited until the building was closed and then jumped to her death. Choi's purse containing her housekeys and a Medicaid card were found in a stairwell of the building, the police said. Nina Saks was killed in a car accident in Nebraska on Aug. 4 while being driven home from California, according to her mother. Saks, who was sleeping in the back seat of the car and not wearing a seatbelt, was thrown from the car when it flipped, killing her. The driver, a friend from home, survived the accident. Her mother said that the cause of the accident had not been determined by police, but that no drugs or alcohol were involved. Saks, who grew up in the Bronx, was very interested in photography and poetry, and participated in a Big Brother - Big Sister program in a church in Harlem, her mother added. ""She wrote beautiful poetry,"" she said. She was planning to take a year of absence this year, according to Assistant Dean of Students William Wiggins. Services for Saks will be held at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 in room 202 of Ferris Booth Hall. Additional reporting by Evan P. SchultzAdrienne Jones"
125,New dean vows crackdown on bias,13 September 1989,"By Kris KanthakJack Greenberg, the new dean of Columbia College, outiined a plan he hopes will create a more positive campus at a speech last night sponsored by the Columbia Gay and Lesbian Association (CGLA). ""It's a kind of spirit I'm trying to generate,"" he said. Greenberg's speech, the first before a student group as dean, emphasized human rights for all minorities. But his appearance before CGLA was meant as a statement to gays and lesbians specifically, he said. ""By my presence and because of my position, I want to show my solidarity fora group that has been too often terribly stigmatized on our campus,"" he said.A hard-line stance against harassment of minorities will be enacted to end this stigma, Greenberg promised the group of over 80 persons. ""We are going to be very hard on racist, sexist, homophobic, [and] anti-humanity kinds of action and word,"" he said. CGLA has become especially concerned with fighting homophobia after a number of homophobic acts, including death threats to CGLA members, were committed last year.Admitting that a tough stance against harassment could infringe on the right to free speech, Greenberg said he hopes to create a code of conduct for Columbia College that will curtail any speech that is ""deliberately stigmatizing and harmful and has no academic value."" Such speech, Greenberg added, includes actions such as displaying swastikas. Greenberg laid out other projectshe will undertake as dean, including the creation of a ""house system,"" which would divide dormitories into smaller groups of students in order to encourage socialization. Greenberg also plans to allocate money to Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization preceptors to invite student to their homes for dinner and to fund faculty dinners to provide a more social atmosphere for the faculty. CGLA Co-chair Thaddeus Grimes-Gruczka, CC '90, praised Greenberg for emphasizing human rights for all minority groups, instead of addressing only gay rights. ""I think that something like that makes a better atmosphere for everyone,"" he said. ""There is less tension."" However, GrimesGruczka added, Greenberg's words about gays specifically were key to the speech. ""I think that the most important thing that he said was what he said at the beginning, that his speaking was a show of solidarity [withCGLA],"" Grimes-Gruczka said. CGLA member Seth Galanter, CC '90, said he wished that Greenberg had gotten into more specifics regarding gay-lesbian relations. ""I was glad that he came but I was disappointed that he didn't have any concrete proposals or ideas,"" Galanter said. According to CGLA member lan Tattenbaum, CC '90, Greenberg may not have prepared concrete ideas, expecting a small crowd. ""I felt bad because he was expecting something much less formal and when he saw such a big crowd, he tried to make a bigger speech,"" Tattenbaum said. Grimes-Gruczka said he felt the speech signaled a period of better communication between CGLA and the administration in the coming year. ""I think it shows that there are open doors and open ears in the administration,"" GrimesGruczka said."
126,Debt-ridden CC book co-op unlikely to reopen,13 September 1989,"By Siobhan StiglitzStudents will be unable to buy discounted books through the Columbia College Book Co-op this year because financial mismanagement and the difficulty of running a business through the Office of Student Activities has forced the co-op to close indefinitely. According to Tom Boytinck, CC '92, who managed the co-op last spring, debts run up last fall by David Keresztes, CC '89, his predecessor, have led most publishing companies to refuse to deal further with the co-op. Keresztes could not be reached for comment. Last spring the co-op existed as a much smaller business than in previous semesters, Boytinck said, ordering only required Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization texts through different publishing houses. ""The econ people [publishers ofeconomics textbooks] wouldn't even talk to us on the phone,"" Boytinck said. While Keresztes and his predecessors' failure to keep written records of transactions contributed to the debts, the Columbia College Student Council, under whose aegis the co-op operated, never intervened to correct the situation, Boytinck said. The council, which last year collected $4,000 from co-op proceeds for its emergency contingency fund, is legally responsible to pay off the co-op's debts, Boytinck said. However, according''to At-Large Representative Virginia Cornish, CC '91, a $3,000 credit owed to the co-op by one publisher means that the council will probably break even this year. But other problems may make it unlikely that the co-op will most reopen next spring. The Office ofStudent Activities does not want to have to deal with the space, scheduling, and accounting problems of the co-op, according to Student Activity Advisor Richard Welch. ""In a semester the co-op handled roughly $40,000. This office is simply not designed to support a business that large,"" Welch said. Welch said that finding space for the co-op and people to sell books on the various shifts each semester proved difficult. Boytinck also agreed that it was difficult to run the co-op through the Office of Student Activities. ""If we were the Harriman Institute [for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union] or Low Library, it would be a different story. As it was we were on the bottom of the totem pole, he said. The length of time needed for the University administration to process checks often led to late payment of bills, he added. When the co-op was first started three years ago by Kaivan Shakib, CC '88, students would order and pay for books one month in advance, according to Boytinck. Eventually the organization established a credit rating, allowing it 90 days to pay for ordered books, he said. Problems such as estimating how many books to order, sending unused books back for credit, and keeping accounting records for the large number of transactions arose once the venture began operating on credit, Boytincksaid. It was only by operating through the Office of Student Activities that the co-op was able to offer its 20 percent discount. Boytinck explained that the co-op, operating out of 309 Ferris Booth Hall (FBH), paid no rent, gave its employees books in return for labor, and used FBH cash registers, thus saving the overhead costs that force even discount book sellers to charge higher prices than the co-op. For the co-op to reopen, publishers would need to be paid with cash in advance, Boytinck said. ""It won't happen,"" he predicted. ""We would need $10,000 at least, and we just don't have it. And we would need to use the University accounting systems, which is inviting disaster,"" he added. The co-op could be run through Columbia Student Enterprises, which oversees profitmaking ventures such as the Columbia Bartending Service and the New York Times delivery service, Boytinck said, but the 35 percent commission Student Enterprises would charge would defeat the co-op's purpose by forcing it to hike its prices. The only other alternative, suggested by Cornish, would be to create an independent student enterprise. She stressed, however, that the new co-op would have to be a Universitywide organization, because ""the publishers will have nothing more to do with the Columbia [College] Student Council Book Co-op.""VERTICAL STACKING: Whatever your wingspan, we all need someone to stand on."
127,Women authors will join Butler facade hall of fame,22 September 1989,"By Nicole Erica DeutschButler Library is known for its inscriptions of the great minds of Western civilization: Sappho, Marie de France, Christine de Pizan, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Bronte, Dickinson, and Woolfe. The names of these prestigious women authors will be displayed next week on a banner above the names of the eight male scholarswhich grace the library's facade as part of a program which will emphasize the scholarly contribution of women authors, according to University Librarian Elaine Sloan. The banner was made by Laura Brown, GS '89, who was arrested while trying to display the banner at last May's Commencement ceremonies. Now, with the support of Sloan and Director of the Columbia Institute on Women and Gender Martha Howell, the banner will be unfurled at 10 a.m. Monday. ""It is a tribute to the kind of energy and creativity that Columbia students have,"" Sloan said. Brown, a Phi Beta Kappa member who graduated summa cum laude, said she felt that she ""wasn't really being taught about [women's] tradition"" at Columbia."" So, she spent last spring researching the library and, with Anne Hanson, a friend who is a painter, started making the white nylon banner. On the banner the womens' names are painted in acrylic paint in the same typeface as Plato, Aristotle, and the other names already on Butler. Many of the male scholars whose names areon Butler are studied in the Columbia College core curriculum courses Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, which has received much criticism for not including the works of women and minorities. In response, some sections of Literature Humanities have added works by women and minorities in the past three years. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God are two of the books that have appeared on the syllabus. Brown said she didn't propose her plan toUniversity officials because she did not expect support for the project. Brown found herself arrested for trespassing on the roof of Butler Library with four non-Columbia friends while waiting to unfurl the banner at Commencement. Because of her activism, she was later approached by many people who expressed support for the idea. She added that an attempt to make a similar banner in 1985 didn't work out. ""It was time for this,"" Brown said. Far from the opposition she had predicted, Brown said that the Columbia officials haveall been extremely supportive. With the help of Dean of the School of General Studies Ward Dennis, Brown contacted Sloan, who liked the idea of the banner, and suggested adding exhibitions and a lecture series. ""Changes don't come quickly, but we hope to create a forum for people to talk about these things in a positive way,"" Brown said. Sloan, however, said that there are no current plans to carve the names onto Butler's facade. On the third floor of Butler, an exhibition, ""The Other Voices—Women Writers of theWestern Tradition,"" will focus on the women writers on the banner and others such as Jane Austen and George Eliot, who were not included in the banner due to space constraints, Brown said. The other exhibit will contain photographs of the creation of the banner and the unfurling attempt last May. Handouts with bibliographies and biographies of the women writers featured in the exhibit will be available in the Reference Room of Butler Library.Elaine Sloan"
128,NEH's ideal core looks like CU's,13 October 1989,"By David KaufmanToo many students are graduating from the nation's colleges and universities without knowing ""basic landmarks of history and thought,"" according to a report issued by Lynn V. Cheney, chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities(NEH). The report, entitled ""50 Hours,"" suggests that institutions of higher learning begin emphasizing general education to fill gaps in college graduates' knowledge. The proposal suggests a model50-hour college core curriculum that would focus on the study of the development of civilization and culture. In many aspects, the proposed curriculum resembles Columbia College's Core Curriculum, re-quired of all Columbia College undergraduates. According to Ainslee Embree, acting dean of the school of Internation and Public Affairs (SIPA), and former chair of the Contem porary Civilizationss department, the first draft of ""50-hours"" many have contained many more references to Columbia that were cut. ""I suspect that there may have been too much Columbia University,"" he said. Issued Sunday, the report cites a Gallup poll showing widespread ignorance of facts that are considered part of a complete cultural vocabulary. The poll tested 691 college seniors with 87 questions about history and literature, including questions asking students to identify significant works or acts by people of color and women. Poll results showed that on a grade scale ranging from""A"" to ""F,"" with an ""F"" being a score of under 60 percent, 55 percent of the students would have received ""F""s while only 2 percent would have received ""A""s. Nine percent would have earned ""B""s, 14 percent ""C""s, and 20 percent ""D""s. Columbia and the Core Curriculum are mentioned several times in the report, which features an extensive ""Curriculum Profile,""detailing the longstanding core tradition at Columbia College. A reading list from the 40-year-old Oriental Humanties course is also given. Currently, Columbia College students spend approximately 52 hours in required classes out of a total of 124 hours needed to graduate. ""At the heart of this [proposed 50-hour] core curriculum is a sequence of courses, taking 3 years to complete, that provides students opportunities to explore the formative periods of civilization on several continents; to follow the development of Western society and thought; to trace the way Americans have extended the Western tradition and developed a distinctive culture in this country; and to understand as well the evolution of other traditions,"" the report said. In addition, the proposed curriculum would require courses in Foreign Language, Mathematics, the Natural and the Social Sciences. During the first year of undergraduate study, students would take three separate year-long courses in cultures and civilization, math, and a foreign language. In the sophomore year, the civilizations and language requirements would be continued, with a class in the natural sciences replacingthe math. During the junior year, the final two semesters of the civilization requirement would be fulfilled, as would the social sciences requirement. There would be no requirements fulfilled during the senior year. Eighteen hours of the proposed curriculum would be devoted to six three-hour courses in the study of cultures and civilizations. The first course would include classes on the origins of civilization, studying the tradional texts of ancient Mesoptamian, Egyptian, Indian, and Hebrew cultures. A second course would include readings from the ancient classical civilizations, continuing through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, ending with the Protestant Reformation. The third course would continue with readings from Descartes, Wordsworth, Austen, Marx, and Woolf. The fourth class under the area of cultures and civilizations would study intellectual traditions in the United States. Works by Ben Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Chief Joseph, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson would be studied alongside art works by Georgia O'Keefe and Frank Lloyd Wright. To satisfy the area's requirement in the studyof non-Western culture, students could choose from courses in the African, East Asian, Islamic, Latin American, or South Asian traditions. Many of the texts suggested by ""50-hours"" mirror those read in the Columbia College Literature Humanities and Contemporary Western Civilizations classes. In addition, works Columbia College students study in Art and Music Humanities would be studied in the same classes with the literary texts in the proposed curriculum. For example, the report suggests that in the segment of the course studying Enlightment, readings by Rousseau and Voltaire be studied along with Mozart's ""Don Giovani."" Embree and Carol Gluck, George Samson Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures, both served as ""readers"" for the NEH proposal according to the report's credits. Embree said he had not received a copy of the report, which was released last weekend. Gluck could not be reached for comment. ""Both Carol [Gluck] and I had a great deal to do with this,"" Embree said. ""We were consultants is what we really were.""In the National Endowment for the Humanities core proposal, each block on the chart represents one year of undergraduate study. White indicates the 50 required core hours; gray indicates time fora major and elective courses."
129,Spectrum Core's defenders doom it to deadwood,13 October 1989,"Core's defenders doom it to deadwoodBy Peter MeierFifty-five percent of college seniors could not identify the Magna Carta. Fifty-eight percent could not identify The Tempest as a play written by William Shakespeare. Twentyfive percent did not know the century in which Columbus first arrived in the New World. These results from a Gallup Poll released this week have sparked a new national panic over the status of higher education. The only winner to emerge in this current litany of the country's educational sins is our very own Columbia University, which commentators are holding up high as a model for emulation by other schools. A few years ago, when America last became suddenly shocked by what the nation's youth does not know, Congress and then-Secretary of Education William Bennett called for the implementation of a ""back to basics"" education in primary and secondary schools. Now, debate is calling fora similar emphasis in higher education. Columbia's Core Curriculum— once considered unfashionable compared to the curricula at hip schools like Brown—is now the wonderchild of magazines such as The Washington Monthly, which praised the Core in its October issue for its ""broad spectrums."" The most flattering approval, however, has come from the same National Endowment for the Humanities report that has spurred the current core-fever, for the report detailed a proposed core curriculum strikingly similar to Columbia's. Basking in the warm rays of vindication, University President Michael Sovern appeared Tuesday on the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour, and proclaimed that the purpose of the Core is ""to produce informed citizens through engaging them with the great works by the great minds of all history."" However informed the Core has made us of the duties of citizenship, campus debate on the Core itself has at times been shockingly uninformed. Much of this debate arose when the University allowed the display of a banner on Butler Library honoring important women authors. The banner is particularly striking because the names of the women writers are positioned prominently above the ancient male ""greats"" which have adorned Butler's facade since the library was built in 1934. Finding the banner an affront to their notion of what should be taught as the foundation of our civilization, some expressed unease that this new banner amounted to a unwise tampering with the canon. In addition to these vocal complaints, one student wrote a letter to The Federalist Paper stressing that the display of the banner is ""unhealthy"" because these women authors are ""inferior"" to male greats. The writer of the letter went on to stress that as students we should want to see the ""best"" authors in Butler's stone face, and that this means not compromising the great male authors by emphasizing ""women's traditions."" Like other cultural conservatives and ethnocentric thinkers, these anxious philosophizers imagine the canon as an im-mutable bastion of truth that must be defended against the ideological forays of liberals, radicals, and feminists. Particular to this ideology is the notion that the canon teaches us the ""History"" of our civilization, and that liberals and feminists hope-to replace this ""History"" with dangerous alternative views of our civilization not based on the unchanging truths of the canon. However much such conservatives may wish to defend against such change, the Core itself provides insight on this issue. We do not study Thucydides, for example, to learn what truthfully happened in the Peloponnesian War, but to examine the origins of Western historiography. That historiography, we learn, is not flawless or wholly objective in its approach, but prone to the same errors of moral judgement andpolitically-influenced analysis that Thucydides was prone to. Some of the Shakespeare history plays that have long been a part of Literature Humanities syllibi similarly address the inherent tension between reality and interpretation in what our culture calls history. If the Core teaches a great truth, it teaches that there are, in fact, no great truths to be culled by a reading of our canon. The canon contradicts itself, presenting not unadulterated truths, but differing views on history and civilization. The canon, moreover, is a political creation intended to serve certain ideological ends. Challenging the content ofthe canon is akin to the questioning by the great thinkers of the political and religious doctrines and traditions of their day. Many of these thinkers would certainly be dismayed to see that their ideas are now usually defended only by panderings to conservatism and out of fear of change. Those who defend the Core as it is often forget that it already is not as it was. A 1937-38 reading list of Literature Humanities published recently in a Harper's Magazine article required several works no longer studied in the class. The latest work required by this Roosevelt-era list was Goethe's Faust, a workeven the most stubborn ideologue would not defend as the last word on our civilization. Many of the women greats now taught in Lit Hum were, of course, not required by the 1937 list. During the same period that this list was drawn up, the names on Butler Library were engraved. They were chosen because they represented the educational ideals and values of Columbia at that time —a time when Nicholas Murray Butler was President-for-life and a time before the Holocaust. These names did not come down to Butler's facade in a lightning bolt from God or Zeus, and theycould be as easily altered as Columbia's Core has been altered through the ages. Unless Columbia's academic leaders resist future attempts to make the Core more inclusive of the experiences it has often excluded —particulary those of women and people of color—the Core will not become as lifeless as the stone letters of Butler and as meaningless as the recent debate over the purported failings of higher education.Peter Meier, CC '90, is Editorial Page Editor."
130,BC faculty to consider new requirement,31 October 1989,"By A. Cassidy SehgalBarnard College Committee on Instruction (COI) and faculty members are considering introducing a new required course at Barnard, according to Barnard College Dean of Faculty Robert McCaughey. The course, which could affect students entering next fall, would be designed to help upper class students integrate aspects of their major and relate their coursework to other academic fields, McCaughey said. Specifics of the requirement have yet to be discussed, he said. However, the course will probably not resemble Columbia College's Contemporary Civilizations (CC) orLiterature Humanities courses, he said. ""Barnard has tended to shy away from a uniform list of works such as in CC or Literature Humanities,"" McCaughey said. Instuctors will probably be given a flexible choice in deciding their own reading list of the requirements, he said. To fulfill Barnard's current distribution requirement, students must take four courses outside of their major, including two in the social sciences and two humanities classes. One of the four classes may be an interdisciplinary course.However, some faculty members feel the distribution requirement should more directly relate to students' majors, McCaughey said. ""There is some feeling that the distribution requirement is diffuse; others believe the distribution requirement at this stage is what it should be,"" McCaughey said. A general education requirement like the one under consideration was first considered by a curriculum review committee of faculty set up in the early 1980s, according to McCaughey. The committee dropped the proposal to develop Bar-nard's other requirements such as quantitative reasoning, he said. ""We did not introduce it at that time because discussion was not conclusive,"" he said. The general education requirement would be an upper level course for students to take in their junior or senior year because these students have already acquired more academic experience in their major fields, he said.""The curriculum review committee was not persuaded that general education was something that happened in your first of second year,"" McCaughey said. Faculty members have yet to consider whether the new requirement would be considered a distribution requirement or a major requirement, he said.IEORA N PALS II: Barnard SGA Rep Council members discuss last week's puzzling Broadway attacks.

131,Poll: Most students use study guides to make it through Core Curriculum,10 November 1989,"By Holly KesslerA majority of first year Columbia College students recently polled said that they use Cliffs Notes and other study guides when preparing for Core Curriculum courses. Professors said, perhaps surprisingly, that they do not discourage students from using the study guides. ""If merely used as synopses, I have nothing against them; the original texts are quite complicated and to get a thorough understanding is often very difficult,'' said History Professor Jacob Smit, who chairs the Contemporary Civilization (CC) Program. Dominique Jullien, Assistant Professor of French and Roman Philology, who teaches Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), concurred. ""The Cliffs can be useful to get an overall picture or to reviewfor an exam. They are good fresheners for what goes on in the stories."" Although Cliffs Notes have developed a negative reputation and are commonly referred to as ""quick-read substitutes for literary classics,"" they remain a popular means for college students to develop a general understanding of the famous works they read, many students said. Students said they believe Cliffs Notes or Monarch notes, which can be found in almost any bookstore, are useful in providing brief plot summaries and in highlighting major themes. Barnard Bookforum Night Manager Chris Doebin said Bookforum sells a few thousand Monarch notes yearly. In a recent Spectator poll of 100 Columbia College first year students, 62 percent of thestudents said they have used Cliffs Notes as supplements to required readings. Additionally, 30 percent of the students said they have never used Cliffs Notes, and 8 percent claim they have used them as substitutes for readings altogether. Many Columbia students said they see the guides as an informative and helpful study guide for the complicated works that they are obliged to read for CC and Lit Hum. Seth Pinsky, CC '93, who is taking Lit Hum, said that students often don't have time to read all the works assigned in the core courses. ""The fact that students feel the need to use Cliff's is a sign that it's almost impossible to do all that is asked of us,"" Pinsky said. Students who read the studyguides said they feel that the synopses clearly explain the complicated ideas and concepts that authors of the original texts develop. ""When I was reading Thucydides for Lit-Hum, I had no idea what was going on, so I used them as a supplement to the book,"" Jennifer Reid, CC '93 said. Another first-year student, Lisa Rutkoske CC '93, also taking Literature Humanities, said, ""When I don't understand the works themselves, the Cliffs help me to see where the authors of the work is coming from and what ideas he is trying to convey."" However, other students regard the use of Cliffs Notes as a short cut that can't replace the actual works. ""I think Cliffs Notes are an atrosity. People pay $20,000 a year for an education and then cut corners by not doing their reading. If youread Cliffs Notes instead of the books, you can't get a sense of the author's manipulation of imagery and language,"" Andrew Rosenblatt, CC '93 said. Jennifer Friedman, CC '93, said she believes that it is unfair that students who rely on Cliffs Notes receive the same grades as students who complete assigned readings. ""I tend to hope that a student's grades are compatible with the amount of effort he puts into his work,"" Friedman said. Professors claim that they know when students do not do their reading. Professor Smit said, ""If students think Cliffs Notes can be a substitute for the original texts, they are badly mistaken and will find that out. I formulate paper topics from a peculiar point of view that cannot be anticipated by Cliffs Notes."""
132,$2 million gift creates two endowed humanities chairs,1 December 1989,"By David KaufmanAn anonymous donor's gift of $2 million will create two endowed chairs for professors who show a commitment to undergraduate teaching, according to University Provost Jonathan Cole. One chair has been specifically designated fora professor from the History Department, but the other chair can be filled by a professor from any one of four departments: History, Philosophy, English and Comparative Literature, and East Asian Languages and Culture. The professors who will be appointed to the new chairs will most likely be senior faculty members already at Columbia who have shown commitment to undergraduate teaching, according to Cole. ""The chairs are for distinguishedpeople who have a very clear track record for concern and empathy for undergraduate teaching,"" Cole said, and who ""best represent Columbia College teaching and research."" The holders of the chairs will berequired to teach at least two undergraduate courses per year, according to the stipulations of the gift. They will most likely have some experience teaching the core curriculum, Cole said. The chairs are part of Columbia's ongoing effort to involve more senior faculty members in teaching the core curriculum, according to Cole. Currently, Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, the two central courses of the core curriculum, are staffed by large numbers of preceptors who are completing their doctoral dissertations. According to Professor of Slavic Languages Robert Belknap, director of the Literature Humanities program, 20 of the 50 sections of the Literature Humanities are staffed bypreceptors this semester. In Contemporary Civilization, 55 percent of the sections are staffed by preceptors, according to Professor of English Michael Rosenthal, former associate dean of Columbia College. The establishment of these chairs is intended to encourage more senior faculty members to teach core classes, Cole said. ""These kinds of honors do carry weight with the faculty,"" he said. Cole praised the anonymous donor as a person who ""understands the needs of a college within a major research university setting."" Although the chairs are presently unnamed, they may be named in the future by the donor, Cole said."
133,CC's Core emerges from '80s virtually unscathed,5 December 1989,"By David KaufmanIt is a tradition, practically a fixation. When you ask a Columbia College graduate what he or she remembers most about college, nine times out of 10 the answer will be, immediately and emphatically— almost nostalgically— The Core. Its existence is almost synonymous with that of Columbia College itself. But the core curriculum is constantly evolving, the content of the course continually changing, and the debate surrounding the curriculum itself never ending.In the history of the core, the 1980s may well be remembered as the decade the core came under fire. The arrival of women at Columbia College and the increased presence of undergraduate students of color changed not only the makeup of the people taking the core, but also the way it was perceived. In the last few years, the core became more and more the focus of attack from those who saw it as a perpetuation of a white-male dominated hierarchy. According to the course's detractors, the core represents an unfortunate canon, one that places works by white, European males above all others, ignoring the oppression that the ideals those white males expounded has wrought upon women and people of color. The movement to include works by writers and thinkers excluded from the traditional canon began in 1983, when women writers were first introduced into Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization.That the introduction of women authors coincided with the coeducation of Columbia College was no accident, according to Former Associate Dean of Columbia College and current Professor of English Michael Rosenthal. The coeducation of Columbia College ""appropriately brought with it the decision to look at the curriculum,"" he says. ""Unquestionably, the arrival of women meant the core curriculum was looked at by people in terms not only of different texts but also of different approaches."" Professor of English and Comparative Literature James Mirollo, chair of the Literature Humanities department at the time, agrees. ""There was this big push to make women more comfortable at Columbia College,"" Mirollo says. The inclusion of women authors was also ""simultaneous with the participation of feminists in the staff,"" he adds. Ironically, this turbulence surrounding the core came when the national outlook towards Columbia's unique requirement was moving in the opposite direction. Increasingly, pedagogical pundits began calling fora broad-based reinstatement of core curricula like Columbia's. Columbia College had remained one of a handful of institutions that maintained a strictly defined core curriculum after the radical upheavals of the '60s and the increased popularity of educational philosophies such as cultural relativism, feminism, and Marxism. The Reagan years had much to do with the clamor for new core curricula. The core was seen by its new right proponents as a traditional pedagogical device that ought to teach the ""great ideas"" of western philosophy. Books such as Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind and E.D. Hirsch's Cultural Literacy decried the shameful state of young America's collective mind. Bloom and Hirsch blamed the cultural relativism of the '60s and '70s, and saw a plague of cultural illiteracy as the cause of the loss of American prestige in the international arena. Reagan's Secretary of Education (and current Drug Czar) William Bennett called often and loudly for the inclusion of Great Books in college curricula.-1 his autumn, Chair of the National Endowment of the Humanities Lynne Cheney strongly recommended a core curriculum of 50 hours of classwork that would focus on the Western Tradition. Her proposed curriculum was remarkably similar to Columbia's core. Columbia's own response to the controversy surrounding the core was the formation of the Commission on the Core Curriculum, chaired by John Mitchell Mason Professor of theUniversity William Theodore de Bary, in early 1988. The de Bary commission's stated purpose was to examine the core and the possibilities of inculding works from the non-western tradition —works by women and people of color —in the core. The de Bary commission also stipulated the creation of the standing committee on the core, now chaired by Queen Wilhemina Professor of History Jacob W. Smit which will monitor the content of the core to ensure its continued up-to-dateness. The findings of the de Bary commission resulted in a Report of the Commission on the Core Curriculum, which recommended the introduction of the extended core, a twosemester requirement meant to expose undergraduates to non-western cultures and the contemporary conflicts of gender and race. As of now, the extended core is composed of courses that already existed in Columbia's curriculum; eventually, it will consist of 25 to 30 courses specifically designed for the extended core, according to Smit, who is also chair of the Contemporary Civilization department. The formation of those courses will demand a considerable amount of financial and teaching resources, Smit says, including money to hire professors and conduct the many hours of research and planning that go into the creation of each new course. Acting Dean of the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) Ainslie T. Embree warns that the institution of the extended core may cut into the teaching staff of the stan—dard core. ""If people teach the extended courses, they won't teach the original core as well,"" he says. But Smit says the University must make a commitment of both faculty and financial resources to the extended core, or ""it would not be following the wishes of its faculty, of the de Bary commission."" Mirollo is quick to point out that the controversy over the inclusion of women in Lit Hum was never about whether they should be included at all; rather, it focused on which women authors ought to be put on the syllabus. In addition, he says, there was also talk of including authors from the African and Latin American traditions, but those movements failed for lack of ""unanimous support."" Apparently, the Columbia College faculty decided ""you can't do everything with Lit Hum. Other voices and other cultures should be attended to on their own [without tokenism],"" he says. While the de Bary commission report and the subsequent establishment of the extended core requirement should solve some of the ideological questions regarding the core, many more fundamental administrative problems still exist. The question of the involvement of senior faculty in teaching the core remains persistent. Whereas much Columbia College promotional literature boasts that the core curriculum approaches an intellectual nirvana where young undergraudates can wrestle with the great works with the guidance of esteemed professors, many undergraduates are disappointed to find their Lit Hum and CC sections taught by dissertation-writing preceptors. The faculty itself sense a lack of senior faculty involved in the teaching of the core. Lit Hum chair Robert Belknap, a professor of Slavic Languages, said 20 of 40 Lit Hum sections are taught by preceptors, and Rosenthal sayd about 55 percent of CC instructors are graduate students.HILLARY RAY"
134,Columbia College swaps angst and isolation for coed dorms and the 'Plex,5 December 1989,"By Robert Hardt Jr.It's Friday night at Columbia and the year is 1980. Your on-campus options for the evening are kind of limited. You can stay in with your floormates (all male), drink lots of cheap beer and watch the X-rated cable t.v. program ""Midnight Blue,"" or, if you are more adventurous, you can go to a poorly attended frat party and leer at F.I.T. ""girls."" Ah, yes. The early '80s at Columbia. Those were the days when undergraduate women could only attend that school across the street. The pub was more of a meat market than a hamburger joint and the 'Plex was an idea ahead of its time. Consuming vast amounts of alchoholic beverages was de rigueur —the drinking age was only 18. ""Boundary break-ing"" during freshmen (all first-year Columbia College students were freshmen then) orientation was powerfully facilitated by an omnipresent can of beer. What a time it was. ""We were so incredibly hard up,"" recalls Tom Vinciguerra, CC'B5. ""I remember a poster fora party that advertised the fact that girls were going to be there. I think two actually showed up."" A Sept. 24. 1981 Spectator Student Life supplement provides a snapshot of the Columbia student's world then. The supplement included four articles: one on student alcoholism, another on caffeine addiction, and a third on the libraries. The last, ""No country club, Columbia,"" complains, ""The social life doesn't revolve around beer keg parties and fraternities. It doesn't revolve period. Relations between the sexes are often distant and strained, and men and women have to go out of their way just to meet one another."" Alienation and angst were the commodities traded in New York. A student could live on the edge of an emotional and academic abyss, ""but he'll be doing it all in New York, which makes this school different from most others. The student here learns to carry money so he'll get robbed but not beaten.""Besides the addition of women to an angstridden social scene, two undergraduate dorms sprouted up. Deans of Columbia College Arnold Collery and Robert Pollack each had a dorm built during their administration. In the spring semester of 1981. East Campus was opened and, for the first time, Columbia College promised four year housing to all incoming freshmen. The opening of Schapiro Hall in the fall of 1988 further alleviated stress on the housing system while also allowing Columbia College to increase its enrollment slightly. While many Columbia dorms were renovated during this decade, the student center, Ferris Booth Hall (FBH), did not receive a facelift. But since Columbia Collegebegan admitiing women in the fall of 1983, FBH has become a more popular location with undergraduates, according to Columbia College Director of Student Activities Chuck Price. ""Co-education made this a better place to hang out,"" Price said. ""Before co-education, Columbia students would go to Macintosh [the Barnard Student Center] to hang out. Now they hang out here,"" Price said.. Price said that when he took his job in December 1981, FBH was strictly a Monday through Friday operation. ""When I came for my job interview [in Sept. 1981], the building was closed. It was closed on weekends. This place was dead,"" Price said. The only floor of FBH that has changed substantially since 1980 is its basement. At the start of the decade, it was home to a rifle range, the student council, music practice rooms and a dilapidated bowling alley, Price said. The Barnes and Noble bookstore in the Journalism building moved into the basement in the fall of 1983, displacing the rifle club and the student council. The council, in turn, moved into Spectator's third floor offices and Spectator moved to its current offices on Amsterdam Avenue. In the fall of 1985, the John Jaypub, a long-time campus rathskeller, stopped serving alcohol and was supplanted by the recently opened 'Plex. The 'Plex, a student disco located in the FBH basement, was an instant success after its January 1985 opening, Price said. ""There were long lines to get into the 'Plex,"" Price said.""lt was open six days a week. Part ot that was because the drinking age was still 19."" That soon changed, however, when New York State raised its legal drinking age to 21 on Dec. 1, 1985. While it is unknown how much of a factor the new drinking age was in causing fraternity membership to rise, it is clear that Greek life at Columbia blossomed during the mid-80s.Today there are over 700 fraternity members at Columbia, about three times the number of ""brothers"" who were here in 1981, Price said. Student activity in Earl Hall, the center for many campus religious and communityoriented groups, has increased as well, according to Earl Hall's director. Rabbi Michael Paley. ""The building is packed,"" Paley said. ""Volunteerism is improving here. Religion, in general, is on the upswing. Students want a deeper sense of intimacy and connectedness,"" he said. University President Michael Sovern applauded the changes in student life that have occurred since 1980. ""It's almost night and day,"" Sovern said in a Dec. 1 interview. ""Co-education, residence, faculty-in-residence, the student activities fee had made the level of support of student activities higher. Just walking around the place —I mean people smile more."" ""I'm very proud of what's happened in that area and it really does make life better for everybody,"" he added. Student life at Columbia will proßably never again change as dramatically as it did in the 1980s. The image of the school as a gritty,tough, ""intellectual"" place is fading fast and being replaced by a new one that is still murky. With the expanded applications pool came students who would never have considered going here in 1980. These undergraduates often demand student services that were never offered before. Columbia College today has an established ""student scene""—something you would have been hard-pressed to find in 1980. The presence of New York City is now surprisingly seen by some who enroll here as an unfortunate burden that must be shouldered for four years rather than a unique educational experience. Columbia, it soon becomes clear, is a depressing place to have to fend for yourself, what with the bare lightbulbs along the corridors, the battered seats, the cockroaches, the peeling walls, the concrete, the muddy pools on South Field. Frustrating, too. It's no secret that a large number of students are sexually frustrated; many say that the atmosphere, rife with sexual tension turns them against the school. They hate Carman Hall because they never see any women there. They go to dances, but it's no fun to dance with other men. When they do meet women, it is typically in a contrived or tense situation. At a floor ratio, the ratio of men jockey rudely for the attention of the few women. Whether true or not, the widely-held assumption about the men living in BHR or the women on South Campus is that they're on the make. Columbia's not a fun-in-the-sun country club, and it's impossible to figure out. Maybe that's why people go to school here. This Columbia, the Columbia of 1981 is no more. The ""typical Columbia student"" has forever changed during this decade, much to the chagrin of some. Shortly after the football team's victory over Princeton that snapped its 44 game losing streak, an unhappy Literature Humanities prefector was overheard telling a friend, ""We should worry less about beating Princeton and worry more that we're becoming just like the damn place!""HATS OFF: The love between frosh and beanie."
135,"""Pencil book"" confusion caused by sick employees",30 January 1990,"By Kirsten DanisThe serious illnesses of two administrators and death of another administrator in the Office of Student Information Services (OSIS) have resulted in this semester's problems with room assigments and pencil book misprints, according to Donald Burd, associate director of student systems. Although the registration period is traditionally marred by confusion, the beginning of this semester has been especially hectic because OSIS Coordinator Lilyan Chapman and her immediate supervisor OSIS Developmental Analyst Robert Zuleg are both suffering from serious illnesses, he said. OSIS has also had to deal with the sudden death of its djrector, Ronald Moe, who oversaw the office's activities. Moe died on Jan. 17 of undisclosed causes. Chapman, who coordinates classroom assisgnments, has been on an indefinite leave of abscence dueto an undisclosed illness which required operations over the summer and last semester, Burd said. According to Bursar William Feimer, who is currently handling Moe's responsibilities, Chapman has coordinated classroom assignments for many years and knows the job's intricacies. ""Lilyan Chapman has been here fora long period of time. When someone like that is not available, you lose a lot of history and a lot of knowledge,"" Feimer said. The loss of Chapman and Moe was compounded by the unexpected illness of Zuleg, who suffered an aneurism and cerebral hemorrhage Thanksgiving week, Burd said. Zuleg, who was coordinating Chapman's responsibilites, has not been working at OSIS since Thanksgiving week and is currently in rehabilitation at Pennsylvania hospital, Feimer said.Since Chapman and Zuleg were jointly responsible for coordinating classroom space, this semester has been chaotic for OSIS, he added. ""You can't lose two key people like that in basically the same area in such a short time span without considerable loss to your department,"" Feimer said. The result has been confusion, especially in classroom assigments, Burd said. ""It's been a total disaster,"" he said. Scheduling Coordinator Lenore Hubner is presently overseeing room assignments, but coordinating space is not her regular job, Burdsaid. The pencil book, which lists classes and their locations, was incomplete or inaccurate for many undergraduate courses, he added. OSIS published three updates, which were available during registration week, to accompany the pencil book, Burd said. Mostly undergraduate classes were misscheduled, according to Burd. ""The professional schools were all set with rooms very early so those classes are complete and accurate. Others were not complete at deadline and not accurate in the pencil book,"" he said.According to Burd, OSIS does not coordinate the classroom assignments for the professional schools, including the Law and Business Schools, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Burd said that OSIS has controlled the scheduling problem and does not anticipate much more confusion. There have been no complaints to his office about double room assignments, Burd said. ""I'm not denying that it's true, but I don't have any firsthand reports of it,""he said. ""They're just not contacting us."" Feimer said he only knew of two cases aboutroom assignment problems in his office. Hovever, an employee in the Department of Contemporary Civilizations (CC) and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) who did not wish to be identified, said the first week of classes was ""horrible."" According to the employee, the CC and Lit Hum office received many complaints about double—and sometimes triple—room assignments. The employee added that the office received calls from students with questions about Art Humanities, History, and Barnard College classes."
136,Seminar to mold extended core course,1 February 1990,"By Kirsten Fermaslichv 0 Columbia's first attempt to create special inter-disciplinary classes to fulfill the Extended Core requirement will take place this Friday in a seminar for professors and graduate students from different academic fields. The seminar is the first of a series designed to create a class called ""Social Hierarchies in the Contem-porary West,"" according to Professor of History and Director of the Center of Women and Gender Studies Martha Howell, who organized the seminars. The series of seminars was funded by the Ford Foundation, according to Howell. The course is intended to be a follow-up to Contemporary Civiliza-tions, and will be designed in a similar fashion, with a syllabus of mostly primary sources and a probable class enrollment of 30 to 35 students, Howell said. Contemporary Civilizations, along with Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities, which are taught in a discussion-styleformat, constitute Columbia College's Core Curriculum. ""It does follow very nicely from [Contemporary Civilizations] . . . It's a study of the failures of [Contemporary Civilizations],"" Howell said. At the beginning of the fall semester, the Columbia College Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum, changed last year's Major Cultures requirement to an Extended Core requirement. The Extended Core requires Columbia College students to take either two courses in non-Western culture, or one nonWestern course and one class which deals with contemporary issues, such as race or gender. The Extended Core requirement is now fulfilled through a list of already existing classes on race, gender, and non-Western societies. - Because current Extended Core classes are often graduate-level classes, or classes otherwise inappropriate for introducing students to other cultures, Columbia College is attempting to create classes similar to Core Curriculum classes that will introduce students to different cultures or important modern topics, according to Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis. ""They're [Extended Core requirements] really designed to introduce students to another culture. The problem is we are implementing the program as we are developing it . . . it's been bumpy in its implementation. It's growing, it's developing,"" Yatrakis said. The social hierarchies class is the first class to be developed solely for the Extended Core requirement and will ideally serve as a model for other Extended Core classes, Howell said. ""It's the beginning of fundamentally confronting contemporary issues through the Core Curriculum,"" Howell said. The seminars being held this semester areintended to allow professors to discuss the intellectual issues and questions behind social hierarchies, and then to find readings that will address these issues, Howell said. The seminars will also allow the professors to better understand the contemporary issues and viewpoints different from their own areas of expertise, according to Assistant Professor of History Atina Grossman, who will participate in the seminar. ""People who focus on gender also need to focus on race,"" Grossman said. The committee's work will only serve as a model syllabus for the course in social hierarchies which will eventually arise from the seminars, according to Howell. The actual syllabi will vary widely from professor to professor, she added. ""At least we will have set up a kind of model that individual professors can tailor to fit their individual concerns,"" said Assistant Professor of Engllish and Comparative Literature Marcellus Blount, who will also attend the seminar. The course, which will ideally be taught in more than one section, will be offered next year, Howell said, although only about 60 students will probably be able to register for it. The number of students should increase each year as more professors are willing and able to offer the class, she said. Other professors attending the seminar are Assistant Professor of History Elizabeth Blackmar, Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature Sussan Winnett, Associate Professor of Anthropology Katherine Newman, Associate Professor of Sociology Mark Mizruchi, and Assistant Professor of Sociology Wanda Morris. Howell said that she chose the professors who will participate in the seminar.BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY: Alma Mater's little sister looks uptown from Straus Park, which will soon be renovated."
137,Off Broadway Spectacle Inside Spread Whatever Happened to CTN?,1 February 1990,"Whatever Happened to CTN?By Holly Phillips and Robert KolkerBefore it arrived, everyone had great plans for it. But now that the Alma B. Schapiro Theater and Music Center is here, no one knows quite who controls it. Last semester, the Columbia Theatre Network (CTN), a selfproclaimed ""parent organization"" of theater groups on campus, was approved by a Columbia College referendum to be the student group in control of Schapiro's 150-seat ""black box"" theater and numerouspractice rooms. But now that the theater is open and CTN lacks the support of most campus theater groups, CTN appears to be out of the bureaucratic picture, and management of the theater remains up for grabs. / CTN's involvement with Schapiro theater began about one year ago. Seth Goldstein (CC '92), acting chair of CTN, had been working with Ehren Fordyce (CC'9O) and Shawn Nacol (CC '92) since February to establish connections with administrators regarding use of the theater. In an interview last September with Spectacle, Goldstein enthusiastically spoke of creating a unified theater community at Columbia. He said he wanted CTN to manage Schapiro independently of Polity—rationing the space in Schapiro just as the Office of Student Activities rations space in Ferris Booth Hall. The end result, Goldstein said, would be higher quality theater on campus—the theatrical arts would be united in a fashion similar to Yale.It was clear that CTN was determined to claim Schapiro as a studentrun facility as early as last spring, when Goldstein, Fordyce and Nacol released a proposal for CTN to manage the then-unbuilt theater.Among other things, the proposal created a full-time paid position of ""technical director"" and gave expressed priority to theater groups over other student groups in the use of Schapiro Theater. ' 'We don't want to have to apologize for putting theater first,"" Goldstein said in September, explaining that the ""black box"" theater would be the best free space on campus for theater, while a cappella groups and lectures could be conducted in the Lion's Den or Wollman Auditorium. The idea of an unrecognized, as-yet unofficial student group pushing to control the $2.5 million facility (and setting its own priorities in the process) understandably ruffled a few feathers. When it came time to vote on the referendum that would make C TN the official manager of Schapiro Theater, several theater groups pulled out of CTN, claiming that CTN was pressuring them to join the network by insinuating that they would be excluded from the use of Schapiro theater if they didn t join. Also, non-theater groups claimed that CTN would give theater priority to the exclusion of all other types of groups.Cut down to a membership of just four theater groups (one of them Goldstein's own Columbia Players), CTN hardly was in a position to unify Columbia's theater community when the referendum passed in November. Today, months after the referendum and a few days after Schapiro theater's belated opening, CTN still has yet to be officially recognized by Polity—ironic considering CTN's ambition last fall to be on thesame level as Polity. All concerned, including Goldstein, see CTN as powerless for now, limited to the publication of a newsletter, coordination of the performances of its member groups, and the development of theater workshops. Goldstein says that no one group will oversee Schapiro immediately, or even after CTN becomes official. He appears to have given up on the bureaucratic dream of a unified theater organization at Columbia, though he continues to deny the accusations made about CTN last fall, saying that the group received ""a slap in the face."" He adds that the political nature of the CTN ordeal has driven many serious theater people away from the management of Schapiro, but that theater groups will begin to cooperate now that the time has come to schedule events at Schapiro. Goldstein's current focus, rather than on Schapiro's bureaucratic structure, is where some have said it should have been all along: on the quali-ty of Schapiro's performances. He and the Columbia players are working on ""Pelleas and Melisande,'' a late 19th century drama by Maurice Maeterlinck that is being co-produced by the Oscar HammersteinCenter for the performing arts. He also is planning the ' ' S c h a p i r o Classic"", an annual fall performance of a selection from the Literature Humanities syllabus, to be viewed by Lit Hum classes."
138,Professor Griff must be heard before judgement is passed,6 February 1990,"By Michael Sant' AmbrogioLast night, there was a meeting on catflpus of members of this community who were outraged at the Black Students Organization's (BSO) sponsorship of Professor Griff. At this meeting, the BSO passed out a statement which included the following quotation: ""While we were aware of the potential controversy this action might incite, we resolved that the need for blacks to educate themselves took precedence over all other considerations."" The BSO obviously felt that the information or ideas which Professor Griff could supply to black studentswas worth the risk of offending other groups in the community. Many at Columbia didn't agree. Many, including myself, fear people with prejudices. Yet, what is our fear really based on? 1 believe it is partially based upon our ignorance. How many of us who do not wish for Professor Griff to speak here, and I again include myself, know what he will say about black education in the year 2000? I didn't know a single thing about it when I attended that meeting, and I doubt if there were many there who did (perhaps excluding members of the BSO). Yet how canwe decide whether to apply the same principle to Professor Griff as we do to those who created the ""great works"" we study in the core courses if we do not know what his ideas on education are? If this man has something valuable to say to blacks concerning their education in the year 2000, how can we wish to avoid exposure to these ideas which would certainly be as valuable to those of us who aren't black? To agree withthese ideas would not make us anti-Semites just as listening to an opera by Wagner also doesn't make us such. Everyone at Columbia College has studied or will study some of the many ""great works"" which Western Civilization has contributed to the world. In Art, Music, and Literature Humanities, as well as Contemporary Civilization, we try to enlighten ourselves with the landmarks of our civilization's arts and ideas. Most of these ""great works,"" we are constantly reminded, were created by white men. Futhermore, some of these men were racist and anti-Semitic, and most were certainly sexist. Yet, this does not and should not stop us from studying these works and taking from them what we can, whether for our improvement or simply our amusement. Columbia College, as well as Barnard and SEAS, instills within us the idea that we can go to an opera by Wagner and enjoy ourselves without condoning anti-Semitism. We can connect with this great composer on a musical level without connecting with this same pathetic anti-Semite on a prejudicial level. We cannot fully know what Professor Griff has to say until we hear him speak. However, the BSO would do a great service to the community by enlightening those of us who only know that Professor Griff is an anti-Semite and know nothing about his views on education. By explaining to the community why these views are so important to blacks and all of us, the BSO might dispell some of the ignorance of those of us who have been offended and assuage our fears. In order to have a harmonious community, we must not only be understanding of others, we must help others to understand us. If there is no dialogue prior to Professor Griff's speech, we will all lose.Michael Sant'Ambrogio is a Columbia College sophmore."
139,Extended Core courses in the works,20 February 1990,"By Kirsten FermaglichThe Standing Committee on the Extended Core is developing several interdisciplinary classes to fulfill the Extended Core requirement, though it will be several years before they can be implemented, according to Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History Jacob Smit, who is chair of the Standing Committee. The Extended Core requirement, which requires Columbia College students to take either two semesters of a non-Western culture or one semester of a non-Western culture and one semester of a contemporary issue, such as gender or race, was created last year. Students currently fulfill the requirement by taking courses already existing in several departments. But the standing committee's goal is to create small seminar-type courses, similar to Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities, according to Smit. ""The whole idea is that in the end it [the Extended Core] will be patterned on the existing Core. Thatgoal for the moment is not achievable,"" Smit said. ""What we have now is a requirement which can be satisfied by sitting in large lecture courses but that is far from what we really want."" The new Extended Core classes may be taught by two professors, rather than by one, which is the format that Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations follow, Smit said. However, Smit said that several problems must be solved before the Extended Core can be fully implemented. ""I don't think anybody realized the logistical problems [behind the Extended Core requirement],"" Smit said. The Extended Core requirement has especially heavily burdened the smallest departments such as Oriental Studies and sociology and may require the University to hire more professors in those departments, he said. Professors who teach the new Ex-tended Core courses may spend less time teaching classes in their areas of specialization, according to Smit. ""Departments will object [to the program] when their traditional strenghts are being undermined,"" he said. Interdisciplinary classes may be difficult for some professors to teach because the subject will not be in his or her specialty, Smit added. ""The burden on faculty will be a preparation for courses slightly outside or often very outside of one's specialty,"" he said. The Standing Committee has applied for several grants to help pay for the development of the Extended Core requirement, and it will also apply fora large National Endowment for the Humanities grant to pay for the implementation of the first three years of new Extended Core classes, Smit said. Teaching assistants, along with tenured faculty, will probably be used to teach the Extended Core classes once the guidelines for the different classes are set up, he said. Of the four classes the Standing Committee is now examining, theone closest to being implemented is a class on the family in the Middle East and North Africa which will be designed by Professor of Religion Peter Awn, Smit said. However, Awn said he had submitted several proposals to the Standing committee a month ago, but nothing was made final. He said he had not received a response from the committee yet. The proposal for the class on the Middle Eastern family was modeled after a comparable family law similar now given to graduate students. Awn said. If the class is offered, its structure will be changed to include other disciplines, like anthropology, Awn said. Other classes being considered by the Standing committee are a class on African culture, directed by Assistant Professor of History Joseph Mbembe, a class on Latin American culture, and a course on human rights current-iy being discussed by Dean of Columbia College Jack Greenberg, Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis and Louis Henkin, University Professor and chair of the Board of Directors of the Center for the Study of Human Rights, Smit said. Courses which currently fulfill the Extended Core requirement do not serve as good introductions to the subject areas because they are overcrowded and too specialized, Smit said.u The new classes will be designed by groups of faculty members in series of small seminars, similar to those now being held by Professor of History and Director of the Center on Women and Gender Studies Martha Howell. Howell's seminars are designed to create a curriculum and a set of guidelines fora course called ""Social Hierarchies in the Contemporary West.""WHO NEEDS EXERCISE: This list was posted at a nutrition workshop last week."
140,Staffing shortages to hit English and Philos. in fall,10 April 1990,"By Kirsten FermaglichThe English and Philosophy departments at Columbia will face staffing shortages next year because many professors in both departments will be on leave. One of the primary reasons there will be a large decrease in the number of professors is because the junior faculty development program, started four years ago, gives assistant professors a semester off to do research, according to VicePresident of Arts and Sciences Martin Meisel. The junior faculty development leave is given to assistant professors in their fourth year at Columbia, Meisel said. Assistant professors who have taught Core Curriculum classes like Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization for three years are also given leaves of one semester, according to Professor ofEnglish and Comparative Literature Robert Shapiro, who will be on leave next spring. In the English department, at least 20 professors out of 46 junior and senior faculty members will be on leave for either one semester or all of next year, according to an administrative assistant of the English and Comparative Literature department. Eleven of the 20 professors leaving are assistant professors. Chair of the English and Comparative Literature Department Joan Ferrante said the large number of professors leaving was a coincidence, but would be somewhat harmful for the department. ""It's a bad year for us,"" Ferrante said. ""This is not our best time."" Visiting and adjunct professorswill replace professors on leave, taking over 25 classes next year, according to Professor of English and Comparative Literature David Kastan. ""There will be absolutely no loss of courses,"" Kastan said. Class offerings in American Literature will be especially low next year, according to Ferrante. In addition to Professor of English Arnold Rampersad's departure for Princeton and Assistant Professor Howard Horwitz, Professors of English Anne Douglas, Andrew Delbanco, Priscilla Wald, and Marcellus Blount will all be on leave next year, leaving only Professors of English Carl Hovde andRobert Ferguson teaching American Literature, Ferrante said. ""The field is almost non-existent this year,"" she said. Although some assistant professors, including professors Blount and Wald, will be on leave because they have won prestigious fellowships outside of the University, most other junior faculty are taking either Chamberlain or junior faculty development leaves. A large number of junior faculty in the Philosophy and English departments were hired four years ago, according to Shapiro. ""We happen to have a large number of junior faculty in one year . . . That's just afluke. Say four years from now, we don't have any. These things tend to work in flukey ways,"" Shapiro said. The possibility of having too many assistant professors on junior faculty development leave was not foreseen by administrators who developed the program, Meisel said. ""One of the lessons is that, in the future, hiring will have to be better distributed,"" Meisel said. The Philosophy department will lose five out of 20 professors for either semester or year leaves next year, according to Chair of the Philosophy department Isaac Levi. Only two of these professors are assistant professors taking University leaves, butbecause the department has also just lost two tenured professors, it will be short-staffed next year, Levi said. ""The fact we lost two tenured people, that puts us now in an extremely abnormal position,"" he said. The department has made one appointment to build up the faculty, but it will not be able to make another for another year, Levi said. ""We're down a person in ancient philosophy but we hope to hire somebody the year after that,"" he said. The department has hired a visiting professor, as well as appointing an assistant professor, to bolster the department's teaching staff, Levi said."
141,Columbia College COI may change L&R to reflect the core,13 April 1990,"By Kristi LemmThe Committee on Instruction (COI) is currently reviewing the Logic and Rhetoric department to consider whether the syllabus for the composition classes should be more closely related to core curriculum classes, according to Associate Dean of Columbia Kathryn Yatrakis, who chairs the COI. The COI regularly reviews academic department to determine if changes are necessary, according to Yatrakis. Yatrakis said the review of the Logic and Rhetoric department was scheduled when the department was created in 1986. Yatrakis said the COI is considering changes in the Logic and Rhetoric syllabus which would connect the class more closely to the Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities classes. However, she said that the committee has not determined what changes, if any, would be made, or how the changes would affect the way Logic and Rhetoric is taught. ""We haven't even thought about what we mean by 'connecting [Logic and Rhetoric] to the core,' "" she said, adding, ""We certainly don't know what the implication will be."" There is no indication at this point that the Logic and Rhetoric syllabus will be changed, according to Professor Sandra Prior, director of the Composition Program at Columbia College. She said that any changes proposed by the COI must be approved by the Logic and Rhetoric department before they can be instituted. Prior said that including elements of the core classes in the Logic and Rhetoric syllabus is a goal of the department. However, Prior stressed that the Logic and Rhetoric syllabus will not be changed to include large amounts or reading. Logic and Rhetoric teachers are not currently required to incorporate elements of the core classes into assignments, but they are encouraged to do so, according to Logic and Rhetoric teacher Karen Hornick. Logic and Rhetoric prefector Ria Coyne said she occasionlly requires students to write on brief passage of works on the LiteratureHumanities syllabus, such as the Illiad. However, Coyne also said that papers assigned in Logic and Rhetoric should not involve an analysis of literature. ""Logic and Rhetoric is an essay writing class. Students shouldn't just be writing about literature,"" she said. Coyne said students should not be required to read entire works, as they are in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""It's unlikely to imagine that [Logic and Rhetoric] teachers would assign lengthy readings,"" Hornick said. Hornick said that including more elements of the core in Logic and Rhetoric syllabus would help to ensure that the Logic and Rhetoric experience is similar for all first year students. ""[A core—oriented syllabus] would make the the experience of taking Logic and Rhetoric more uniform for first year students,"" she said.. n c-v.

142,"Temp, replacement found for Rampersad",17 April 1990,"By Kirsten FermaglichThe English Department has found a visiting professor to temporarily replace Zora Neale Hurston Professor of English Arnold Rampersad, the chair of the African-American studies program, who will leave Columbia at the end of this term. George Cunningham, who is now a professor at Brooklyn College, will teach four classes at Columbia next year, three of which will replace Rampersad's courses, according to Professor of English David Kastan. Cunningham's fourth class willreplace a course taught this year by Assistant Professor of English Marcellus Blount, a member of the inter-disciplinary African-American studies program, who will be on leave teaching at the University of Pennsylvania next year. Blount also teaches both semesters of Literature Humanities, which will be taken over by other professors, according to Kastan. Cunningham's work at Columbia next year will allow the English department to offer the five classesit normally provides for the AfricanAmerican studies program, Kastan said. The fifth class provided by the English department. Race and Racism, which was taught this year by Assistant Professor of English Priscilla Wald, will be taught next year by Professor of English Robert Hanning, who created the class, according to Kastan. Rampersad's departure will be a significant loss to the African-American studies program, according to faculty members interviewed. ""It's clear to anyone, to everyone, that his leaving would seriously weaken the department because there are so few faculty members involved in the program now,"" said Professor of History Hollis Lynch, a member and former chair of the inter-departmental African American studies committee. ""I think it's a great loss for the department and a great loss for the program,"" Blount said. Both Lynch and Blount said the AfricanAmerican studies program has gaps in it now, and Blount said he will concentrate on strengthening the department after he returns from his leave next year. ""1 intend to devote my energy to building African-American studies. With the administrative assistance we could staff more courses, attract more majors and establish Columbia as a center for African-American studies,"" Blount said. The English Department has already begun informally searching fora long-term replacement for Rampersad, according to Chair of theEnglish Department Joan Ferrante. The department's search will formally begin in the next academic year, Kastan said. Last year the English department attempted to recruit Professor of English Henry Louis Gates Jr., but the University was not prepared to meet Gates' conditions, according to University Provost Jonathan Cole. ""We were very much interested and made him a fantastically good offer, but for the resources he wanted, we might have been able to get four professors,"" Cole said. The history department will also search for a professor in African-American history next year, according to Acting Chair of the History Department Michael Stanislawski. Only a few undergraduates major in African-American studies, in part because the program is trying to limit students because of the small number of classes offered in the area, according to Blount. ""At this point, it's a kind of interim strategy focused on providing service courses,"" he said. Students said people do not major inAfrican-American studies because there are not enough professors. ""There are so few experts in this field .... [students] have to take the same people over and over again,"" Warigia Bowman, CC '90, said. The University should try harder to attract more minority professors who might not be in the small exclusive network in which Columbia now searches for professors, Bowman said. ""I think Columbia places a lot of importance in credentialism. There's a very small number of schools they'll hire people from,"" Bowman said. Columbia should also change its patterns of minority hiring to prevent departmental dependence on one professor, such as Rampersad, Bowman said. ""As long as Columbia only brings in this sprinkling of people at a time, we'll have tokenism basically,"" she said. Also, Columbia has not committed enough resources towards hiring minority professors, according to Bowman. ""Some of the administrators need to stoptalking and start doing ... If a few buildings have to go unrepaired, that's going to have to happen,"" she said. ""We're putting money into the physical plant but not into the mental plant."" The stifling atmosphere the University provides for minority professors might have been the reason Rampersad left, according to Petra Lewis, CC '92. ""It's very difficult for black faculty to walk that fine line. It's hard not to be sort of emotionally involved in teaching AfricanAmerican studies. The detachment that's asked of them is really unfair,"" Lewis said. Bowman suggested hiring junior faculty who have just received their Ph.D. 's, to increase Columbia's minority hiring. Administrators say they are trying as hard as possible to increase the University's minority faculty, especially its junior faculty. ""It is very difficult these days to keep minority faculty in one place,"" Cole said. Cole said the University is attempting to hire more junior faculty as, ""the best way to effect change."""
143,English department changes funding,30 April 1990,"By Kirsten FermaglichChanges in the graduate division of the English and Comparative Literature department will equalize funding for graduate students, but students studying in or past their seventh year will not receive funding from the department, according to Professor of English Jean Howard, the director of the English graduate program. Departmental funding next year will average around $7,000 per student, including the salary for teaching composition courses or for being a teaching assistant for English courses, Howard said at an open graduate student meeting on April 20. The English department's changes are part of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences' (GSAS) longterm plan to reduce its number of graduate students, while increasing their financial aid in order to allow more students to complete their dissertations faster. The English department will attempt to fully fund all graduate students with $9,000 annually within two years, Howard said. During the two-year transitional period, some students who have not yet studied for seven years will not be funded at all, Howard said. However, over 50 percent of eachclass will be fully funded next year, according to Howard. Under the new plan, each year of a graduate student's study will be funded differently with teaching positions, fellowships, and tuition, she said. Students who have been in the program for seven more years will not receive any departmental funding, Howard said, though they will be able to apply to teach Literature Humanities. Several students complained about the department's new policy towards students in the seventh year or beyond. ""These people who have been so ill-treated by Columbia are just being cut off,"" said Logic and Rhetoric instructor Ria Coyne. Howard said funding for graduate students beyond the seventh year has always been limited. Only one student beyond the seventh year was funded last year, and only four or five were funded the year before, she said. ""We're not talking about a large change here,"" Howard said. Dean of GSAS Roger Bagnall said it would be impossible for the University to fund students beyond the seventh year. ""It is not economically feasible tosuddenly give support to as many students beyond the sixth year. [We cannot] put the plan in place because we can't give money to everybody,""Bagnall said. However, Howard said a Wednesday meeting of the Committee on Guidance and Evaluation (CGE) will decide more precisely the exact status of graduate students in the seventh year or beyond. The CGE is a committee of tenured and untenured professors and students that handles admissions, evaluations, funding decisions, and sets policy for the English department's graduate division. The department will have to cut back on some expenses in order to pay for the increased funding for graduate students, Howard said. The changes call for all third year students to begin teaching the Columbia College Logic and Rhetoric and the General Studies composition program fora two year period, according to Sandra Prior, director of the Columbia composition program,. Students who had been planning on teaching a third year next year will receive dissertation fellowships of $7,000 to work on their dissertations without distraction, Howard said."
144,FOCUS Spectator's handy guide to the Columbia budgeting process: Watch your tuition dollar do the Low Library Lambada,30 April 1990,"Spectator's handy guide to the Columbia budgeting process: Watch your tuition dollar do the Low Library LambadaBy Kirsten DanisLet's face it. In your daily routine at Columbia, the budget is just not something that you think about. Even in those philosophical moments during late-night discussions when the conversation turns toward Hegel and religion, very rarely does anyone pipe up, ""You know, I've been thinking about the University budget lately There's a reason for the ignorance: the budget is boring. But now you have a way to avoid all those nasty charts and numbers in this concise guide to the University budget. Here is revealed the tormented history of Columbia finance, the magic route that your tuition dollar travels, and the many fascinating people who control it. A Short History of the Budget There is an old adage from the lore of the extremely wealthy: Never dip into the principle. That is, if you have a lot of money, invest it, live off the interest, and do not, under any circumstances, touch the initial capital. Sound advice, but in the 19705, Columbia didn't follow it.The 70s were years of financial instability for all universities nationwide, including Columbia, which was recovering from the upheaval of 1968. According to Deputy Vice President for University Planning and Budget Gerald Finch, student riots in the late 60s had repercussions which damaged Columbia into the next decade. Admissions and fundraising, which provide two major sources of income, fell significantly after 1968 and left Columbia struggling to support itself. Many faculty members, disgruntled with the situation, also left the University for more stable institutions. Equally as damaging as the financial scars of a student and faculty exodus, a declining national economy threatened Columbia in the 19705. The 1973 oil embargo drove Columbia's utilities budget through the proverbial roof. In 1978-79 Columbia College students were spending 12.1 percent of their tuition on utilities, while today Columbia College students contribute only five percent of their tuition to energy needs. The inflated 70s economy drastically lowered the standard of living in New York City and led to a financial crisis which affected the entire city, including Columbia. The school needed space, money, and students— none of which existed in great abundance in the New York City of the 19705. The shortages sent Columbia reeling from a shrinking resource base and forced the school into operating from budget deficits. ""If you add all those things together . . . the combined effect just destroyed the University,"" Finch said. To keep the school functioning, Columbia dipped into its principle. The University spent $86 million of its endowment in the 19705, money that, if left in investments, would currently be worth $240 million. The financial crisis also forced the school to ignore a deteriorating campus. Crumbling buildings and inadequate facilities all fell victim to a tight budget that was barely covering daily Univer-sity activity. The 1980s, however, brought University President Michael Sovern, Ronald Reagan, and a recovering national economy to Columbia. The last decade became a rebuilding period for the school. The University increased its endowment and enrollment, and in 1980. the budget was balanced for the first time in 14 years. But in its race to repair the damage of the 70s, Columbia overestimated itself. Renovations, an increased student body, and rapid development along with decreased federal and state aid for private education placed enormous pressure on the school's resources. ""In the 1980s, we may have expanded a little too hard and a little too fast,"" Finch said. Now, as Columbia finishes the 89-90 fiscal year and approaches the next, Columbia administrators are growing increasingly anxious not to repeat the mistakes of the 19705. Administrative budgets did not increase this year and will not increase next year. Academic programs are undergoing rigorous reviews that evaluate their importance to the school. ""It's truly phenomenal how many universities are having problems now,"" Finch said. ""It's a very tough time, suddenly, for higher education."" The Process: An Introduction ""Many intelligent people at Columbia have a difficult time understanding how we spend our money,"" Finch said. Not surprising. The budgetary process at Columbia is extremely complicated and inadequate. Currently, the budget is conducted under the Direct Responsibility Center Model (DRCM), a confused system that provides individual schools with little room to test new programs and to handle short-term changes in income. ""A real inadequacy is that we budget at the margins rather than at the program level,"" University Provost Jonathan Cole said. ""We just tend to look at increments to the budget beyond what the base is, but we never really look at how the money is being spent at the base."" In other words, they're as confused as we are, and that's why they hired an outside consulting firm last semester to review the model. Cole said he expects the results at the end of this semester. Put off those travel plans. Endowment? DRCM? Resource base? Well, these are impressive terms and all, but they don't tell you where your money is spent. So, in the fine tradition of flow charts, Cliff notes, and Schoolhouse Rock, watch your tuition dollar wind its way through the infamous Columbia bureaucracy. There are three major sources of income at Columbia: interest from the endowment, gifts and grants, and your tuition. The first two willbe discussed later (followed by a short quiz). Tuition, unlike the other sources, is under the complete control of the University. Administrators like Finch and Cole raise the rate of tuition every year for each division of the University. Although individual schools have the option to increase their tuition by a higher percentage than what the central administration recommends, they cannot go lower. After you (or your parents, or some benevolent higher force) pay your tuition to the Bursar's office, the money goes into an account at Chemical Bank. All the money, no matter its source, is put into a central University coffer from which funds are taken. For instance. Law School tuition mingles with School of the Arts tuition which mixes with Columbia College tuition. As Finch put it, ""We don't color the money."" Now you know that your dollar does not have a large red sign on it saying ""For the Journalism School (or the Business School or the Engineering School) only."" So how do you get it back? Schools set their budgets for the most part according to past progams, faculty salaries, and financial aid. Unfortunately for those administrators with creative genius, there isn't much room for shift within the budget, especially in the DRCM process. ""Most of our budget has been historically determined,"" Finch said. After the schools develop their budget proposals, they go to Cole's office where the deans and the Provost hold hearings. Cole reviews the administrative portions of the budgets and considers requests for more funds. Cole heads the University Planning and Budgetary Committee (called the P & B bythose in the know), which also includes such Low Library denizens as Finch, Senior Vice President Joseph Mullinix, Vice-President for Arts and Sciences Martin Meisel, Dean of Columbia College Jack Greenberg, and others. Together with the P & B. which is really just an advisory committee to the Provost, Cole decides which academic 112 rograms get priority above others. ""The decisions are based on a perceived need and academic priority. He [Cole] establishes the agenda, the sense of discussion,"" Finch said. One of the many problems with the DRCM process is that schools within the University have to beg for money to fund their programs. A very complicated solution to the problem is tuition pass-throughs. Essentially, tuition passthroughs allow an individual school to raise its tuition higher than the number recommended by the central administration and keep the difference. Columbia College, often the beneficiary of tuition pass-throughs, falls under the auspices of the Arts and Sciences. Columbia College does not send a separate budget to Cole but is instead part of the entire Arts and Sciences budget. That is why Columbia College students and students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences easily share professors. When Columbia College elects to raise its tuition above the recommended amount, the extra money goes to Arts and Sciences, not Columbia College. Of course, the college receives some of the money, but not necessarily all of it. According to Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka, who has been coordinating the school's budget this year, college administrators do not mind the tuition passthrough process because improved graduate programs help Columbia Columbia by providing instructors for Logic and Rhetoric, Contemporary Civilizations, and Literature Humanities. In the next budget, however, schools will have less incentive to use tuition pass-throughs because the central administration is changing the rewards. Now schools keep all the money beyond what the University requires, but in the next budget —which will be released this summer —they will be able to keep only twothirds of the remainder. ""By allowing schools to increase the rate of tuition to make ends meet, we put more pressure on the tuition than we had to,"" Finch said. ""This year we reduced the incentive [for pass-throughs]. It makes them think a little harder before increasing tuition."" Not that schools were just jumping on the chance in the first place. Tuition passthroughs, by raising the rate of tuition, also raises financial aid needs. In a school like Columbia College, where the bulk of the budgetgoes to financial aid. much of the revenue from tuition pass-throughs ends up back in financial aid packages. Ultimately, Cole makes the hardest decisions before the budget progesses to Sovern and the University Trustees. ""In some sense, all of it funnels up here, to the Provost's office, eventually,"" Cole said. ""I work very closely with the staff of the Office of Planning and Budget, and with Mr. Mullinix's office, and all of the deans. We try to set priorities and plan for the future."" Like most things of relative importance at Columbia, the final say on the budget belongs to Sovern and the Trustees. After Cole discusses, changes, and approves the budget, it moves to Sovern. Sovern usually accepts Cole's decisions, and then the Trustees finally votes on the completed version. Although these two powers technically control the budget, both tend to agree with Cole's recommendations. Investments—The Real Money ""Tuition doesn't pay for the full cost of what we do here,"" Finch said. In the 1989-90 budget, tuition accounted for $201.7 million in the University revenue, and interest from the endowment brought Columbia $63.2 million. Numbers, numbers. But what exactly is an endowment and how can I get one? Put simply, ""An endowment is a lot of money or a sum of money that you invest in some way or another, in stocks, bonds, land, etcetera,"" Finch said. The actual investment capital comes form donations, not tuition, and, if all goes according to plan, a school should live off the interest and never touch the original investment. Well, the 70s aside, Columbia's endowment now stands at $1.2 billion. If that number sounds impressive, it is. According to Vice President of Investments Roberta Weil, there are only seven endowments in the country in excess of $ 1 billion. (Harvard University, with an endowment of $5 billion, has the largest, and don't think there aren't a lot of really jealous people here.) After many, many people donate their bits of their fortunes to Columbia, the money is placed in the care of different investment companies which buy the stocks. Because the University needs the interest on the investments to finance its activities, it looks for companies which will provide quick returns. ""We avoid investments which have a long payback time,"" Weil said. Although a large bulk of the endowment is from donations, land sales also help support the University. For example, the 1984 sale of Rockefeller Center almost doubled the endowment, Weil said.Two events in recent years had a. direct effect on Columbia's investment portfolio: the 1985 divestment movement and the stock market crash of October 1987. Althought there is no way to discern the tangible results of these events, Columbia's faith in the strength of its investments wavered in their wake. After the Trustees voted to divest from South Africa in 1985, Columbia's money managers used the list of the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) as a guideline for companies which still had facilities in South Africa. The companies from which the University divested were mostly large corporations, and the switch to investment in smaller companies threatened the stability of the portfolio. ""The stocks from which we had to divest are large companies,"" Weil said. ""When we divested, we reinvested in smaller companies."" Divestment may have reduced the income of the endowment, but there are no formulas to measure the difference. According to Weil, there is speculation that he University lost as much as one percent of the portfolio's value, but no one is really sure. Columbia did lose money by divesting from pharmaceutical companies, which have grown in recent years. ""One area where we certainly lost money is by not being able to invest in pharmaceutical companies like Johnson & Johnson, Merc, and Squibb,"" Weil said, ""they've done extremely well over the last three years."" The October 1987 stock market crash did not destroy Columbia's portfolio, but it certainly forced the University to continually glance over its financial shoulder. According to Weil, Columbia lost part of the value of the endowment in 1987, but by the next year, the investments had substantially recovered. If divestment and the crash did not cripple the actual endowment, they made the University wary of its financial stability. Another major source of income for Columbia is grants and contracts. As a measure of the school's assets, these numbers are often misleading because the money is already tagged for specific purposes. In 1989-90, $181 million came in from government grants directed toward particular projects and $58.8 million in unspecified funds. The University also received $26.3 million in directed grants and $3.3 million in indirect funds from outside intitutions such as philanthropic foundations. The endowment and grants are similar because Columbia has very little control over them. A weak market and a dearth of government funds can force the University to raise the only resource base over which it has complete control—tuition.Spending the Cash The entire University budget for 1989-90 was $788.9 million. At the risk of slipping into a hazy fiscal ennui, where did it all go? The bulk of the budget, $470.8 million, is returned to the schools for faculty salaries, administration, and financial aid. About one million goes to departments for programs. The University's central administration gets $52.9 million for its contribution, and the maintenance and security account for $46.9"
145,Columbia Daily Spectator Degree of ignorance,16 May 1990,"Degree of ignoranceWhat does a degree from Columbia University mean? Unfortunately, a degree from any undergraduate division of Columbia does not insure that its recipient is a Renaissance woman or man with an open mind. The University community was rudely reminded of this by Men's Varsity Soccer Team Captain Chris Ziadie at his Varsity ""C"" Dinner speech. The content of Ziadie's speech, however offensive, was a valuable reminder to all Columbians that education must not stop after four years at Columbia. The ideas that Ziadie expressed in his speech must have festered within him for many years. Whether Columbia could have taught Ziadie something that might have changed his opinions is unclear. But Columbia must maintain as its goal of nuturing each and every student into chalenging his or her ideas. Columbia must push all students to explore their own thinking processes and to listen to the opinions of others. Ziadie is only one of many Columbians who was not forced to explore and express his ideas, and he is one of many who will leave Columbia neither enlightened nor even exposed to the ideas of others. But many in the class of 1990 are enlightened. And with this enlightenment comes a unique sensitivity to the problems of prejudice and intolerence. Those who are outraged by the words of Chris Ziadie must stay outraged toward all examples of intolerence based on race, religion, gender, or sexual preference. All Columbia graduates should be trained as defenders of acceptance and tolerance. The class of 1990 is the last class that witnessed the horrible racial violence in the spring of 1987. The many other incidents that took place during the tenure of the class of 1990 bear witness to the ongoing plague of racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, and homophobia that ravages not only the Columbia campus, but this city and this country as well. Columbia College instituted the Core Curriculum after the first World War as a means to prevent another such tragedy. Although Columbia College certainly failed in this goal, its intention was virtuous and the idea was on thf> right tragic Thp» claceroom ie the best place tO CUre not only the symptom of intolerence, but the disease itself. If Literature Humanities and Contemporary Western Civilization do not provide means to challenge the thoughts of all students, alternate means must be found. Columbia does a disservice to allow students to graduate in ignorance."
146,A Columbia education summed up,16 May 1990,"By Joshua C. GilletteYou can do a lot in four years. To take just one example, between the years of 1470 and 1474 two Germans in the Danish Service, Didrick Pining and Hans Pothorst, undertook a voyage to Iceland and the west, supposedly at the request of the king of Portugal; the evidence does not show that they went beyond Greenland. To take another: between the years of 1986 and 1990,1 and a couple hundred other people went to Columbia. I know about the Pining-Pothorst pilgrimage because I looked it up in a big World History encyclopedia I got in high school. Such books are generally available; a Columbia education is pricier and harder to come by. While the former offers a chronologically arranged history of humankind from the Paleolithic Period to the present and an index of over 200 pages for quick, easy-to-read reference, the latter is valued more highly by society for its requirement that students engage and grapple with the eternal questions that arise out of the variegated fields of human endeavor, and for the fact that its binding does not break and cause it to fall off the shelf and send tumbling all the books it was holding up. But given these valuable features, how well does this education work? Can it be means-tested? Forget the stuff outside the classroom—nobody has to pay a hundred grand to make posters, play chess, help the disadvantaged or suck in their cheeks, wear maroon jackets and sing. Of course we learned more outside the classroom, from our peers. We're also in a very special period in our lives, full of wide-ranging emotion, activity and accomplishment; the deans appreciated our participation in the life of the College and will miss each of us in a different way; we'll treasure these memories forever; and we lived in the only college town in Manhattan—Morningside Heights. And Dial soap is better in several aspects from any other skin-cleansing product. Never mind the copy and agitprop—we need results, cold hard data on what a Columbia education teaches. With eight semesters of liberal education under my gown, what do I know now that I didn't before? And did it require four years that could have been more prudently allocated? In the interests of science and in the spirit of the oversimplification that inevitably results when journalism and academics mix, to prove that college students know a little something—and nothing more than that little something—about lots of things, and to save time for high schoolers considering putting off their own voyages to Iceland and the west until after college, I'd like to offer this handy resource for autodidacts: Everything I Learned in College. Columbia, like many colleges, has its wondrous moments of joyous selffulfillment and discovery (cf. your school's yearbook). Butrowing admissions process, the contrived orientation friendships, the rejection and depression and embarassment and frustrated ambition, the sleepless weeks, and all the rest of it, and get beyond Greenland. First Year, Fall: Contemporary Civilization: There's a Great Chain of Being, with Plato at the top and Nietzsche at the bottom; it is all the workers of the world have to lose. Logic and Rhetoric: It is a solecism to recklessly split an infinitive. French Conversation: Literature Humanities: Comedy is very old, but very old comedy is not very funny. Physical Education (soccer): Don't leave valuables in your locker. First Year, Spring: CC II: Humankind investigated God, then got bored and looked at nature, tired of that and examined people themselves, then, antsy as all get-out, trained the light of theoretical inquiry on language itself; Monty Python's Philosophy Song makes fundamental sense. Ethnicity in America: Immigrants came to America twice, in big waves, to look for work. Art Humanities: The Parthenon looks all evenly proportioned, but really was about to collapse; eventually, it did. Lit Hum II: Dead white men write good books Physical Education (CPR): Five compressions, one breath. Sophomore Year, Fall: Shakespeare I: Shakespeare's concerns included pressuring societal conventions and, secondarily, making stuff rhyme. America in the Era of Slaves and Jackson: Southern whites backed the enslavement of blacks so that they could have someone to feel superior towards; this is also the reason why many people voted for Andrew Jackson. Music Humanities: Summer is icumen in, and with swimsuit season just around the corner, sonata lot of time left to alto your looks by Chopin off the pounds. Unless you plan to be Haydn those unsightly bulges from all the strawberry Schubert you've been eating, you'll be melismarable; but now's your chants to tone that body, so get to your local Joy of Movement center on the double —meter's running. (MoneyBach guarantee) Plato: Plato, who may or may not have been Socrates (who may or may not have existed, but was a man, and since allmen are mortal, all men are Socrates), held that visible objects in the world are mere representational imitations of intangible Forms, abstract objects whose relation to each other and to those objects-in-the-world is a whole 'nother story. Physics for Poets: While randomness is increasing, so is the size of the universe, so that there's plenty of room for all the new and smaller items scientists continue to discover and show off to laypersons, whose lack of sophisticated understanding of their world is matched only by their ingratitude to the scientific community. Sophomore Year, Spring: Principles of Economics: Faced with the option of cleaning up trash in a public park, the rational person will ask: What's in it for me? Intro to French Lit: Roman History: You could really get ahead in the Roman Army if you knew people. East European Jewry 1772-1917: Liberal European Jews joined the Socialist Bund, while some conservative European Jews helped the Russian authorities draft their fellows—l think. Physics for poets II: Scientists want to know three things about objects: what they are made of, what forces affect them, and what effect they exert on things around them. (For example, government grants are made of money, they are affected by the usefulness of research to the military-industrial-death-gel-producing complex, and they exert a positive force in the lives of those who receive them.) Junior Year, Fall: Anthropology: Pre-marital sex is not a problem, but premarital dining is, among the members of the Brazilian Yanamamo tribe. US History Since 1945: Everyone in the 1950s agreed that Alger Hiss was bad but not much else was; in the 1960s they realized he was about the only OK thing; and then there was Watergate. US Labor during the 20th century: The AFL/CIO practices craft unionism, but the International Workers of the World (""the Wobblies""—a mnemonic device that gave this class bonus educational value) wanted to build One Big Union, and so would take anyone; essentially, the IWW threw a union and noone showed up. Topics in Asian Civilization, the Middle East, and India: There is a dynamism and creativity to the cultures of these nations that fires the mind so strongly that it can produce six disquisitions worth four points in one night. Metaphysics: There's no such thing—those things we think are ideas are actually the neurophysiological symptoms of John Jay Pub food. Philosophy Writing Workshop: Irony works better than sarcasm. Yeah, right. Junior Year, Spring: Radical Tradition: The Abolition movement was like the Civil Rights Movement in some ways, different in others. Civil Rights Research Topics: Pervasive jury discrimination rigged the American justice system against blacks from thestart; things have changed with Supreme Court rulings, but discrimination in selection is still tough to prove. And, according to Richard Kluger's book Simple Justice, Jack Greenberg was a steely-eyed, square-jawed firebrand with a cool analytical mind in the 19505. Nietzsche: It's all relative, even the proposition that it's all relative. And that depends on where you're coming from. Oh, plus art is dead, and the sensual and formal drives combine in people to form the play impulse—the prime mover of MTV. American Urban Politics: Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Senior Year, Fall: Afro-American Literature: If the poem has references to jazz, it's probably by Langston Hughes. British History: Britain grew into quite an empire. Philosophy of Language: In certain graduate philosophy courses, you must always attend class and be very sure of deadlines. Politics of Policy Making: In certain undergraduate political science courses, however, you can go to class only twice and get an A. Senior Year, Spring: Opera and revolution: German Literature in World Context: Revolting people tend to write and produce opera, though Beethoven wasn't as boorish as Wagner. Fascism: It could happen here if we don't look out, because the Germans and Italians weren't dummies—they, in fact, cared more about a candiate's positions and politics than his marriage and hair color. British History: Britain declined from quite an empire to not so great an empire. Attitude, Action, and Reason: To justify their behavior, many people point to reasons which, if they thought about it,would emerge as silly; everything we do can be reduced to motions of the body; emotions are very complicated combinations of sensation, belief, physiological reaction, behavior, and judgements; therefore, I should just own up and say I used to hit my little brother because I felt like it. Comparative Modern Fiction: The modern novel decentered the subject, played out the subjective obsessions of the modern artist in highly-charged prose, and was, frankly, in certain cases much longer than it really needed to be. Glib reductionism? Maybe. But keep in mind, ours was the MTV generation, nursed on TV news soundbites and told we weren't culturally literate, that we had know-nothing American minds just barely ajar and snapping shut fast. What did manage to sneak in were factoids, bereft of context and proportion, they said. That I am able to pluck complete sentences out of the rapidly-shifting video-like montage that is my memory of these courses is, I propose, a modest but notable coup. Perhaps as my fellow graduates tally their totals, I'll emerge the deviant one. Perhaps process is more important than product, becoming educated more important than being educated. Maybe the typical Columbia graduate in 1990 remembers more than a few disjointed, impressionistic fact-blotches or conceptettes from each class. Columbia does attract people with uncanny abilities to sustain intense interest in the recondite minutiae of esoteric topics—witness Modern Times writers (and readers). And some people did tape record the lectures in my economics class. So I could be wrong. But I suspect that for most of us, the one other thing I learned in Comparative Modern Fiction, from Nabokov's Lolita, wraps up the collegiate enterprise as we underwent it:""I am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing everything."" Actually, I got that out of a book of quotations. Q.E.D.Joshua C. Gillette is a former Spectator Editor-in-Chief and will graduate Cum Laude from Columbia College today."
147,Meet your new best friend-- Columbia's own core curriculum,30 August 1990,"By Kirsten FermaglichMost people think of college as a time to broaden horizons and open their minds. They consider it a time to escape the tedium, monotony, and mindless conformity of high school. Yet these very same people then choose to go to Columbia for college only to be faced with a new, broader version of this high school monotony: the core curriculum. Although some people specifically chose Columbia because of the core (""Requirements? I ain't afraid of no stinkin' requirements""), many did not think very carefully about what it might mean to devote two years of their lives to studying dead white men. But never fear. Columbia administrators have determined that students should no longer spend two years studying the ideas of the ruling class,- instead, students will spend closer to three years studying the ideas of the ruling class, and maybe some token classes on the ruled. That's right, sports fans. The core it is a'changing. Two important areas in the core curriculum are in the midst of overhaul, and while these changes may not directly affect the classes of '9l or '92, there is a chance they may touch the class of '94. The first area of change is the extended core, a requirement with which you're probably familiar by now. The extended core requires CC students to take either one semester of a a topical issue, such as race or gender, and one semester studying a nonWestern culture, or two semesters studying two non-Western cultures. Sounds good, right? Wrong. There have been several problems with the emended core requirement, most of them involving the classes used to fill therequirement. Obscure graduate classes designed for four Nepali history specialists were suddenly flooded with fifty undergraduates, some of whom were slightly interested in Nepal and most of whom couldn't find it on a map. This not only made it difficult for professors to teach complicated subjects, but the undergraduate . students themselves weren't really getting a great understanding of different cultures by taking classes that were too complicated for them. The only logical solution, it would seem, would be to create new classes, which is exactly what Columbia is trying to do. These classes would be structured the way typical core curriculum classes like Contemporary Civilization or Literature Humanities are, in seminar format, with a goal of familiarizing students with the basics of a broad range of ideas or authors.The new extended core class closest to completion is a class on social hierarchies created by Professor of History Martha Howell, but there are others in the works. Howell and Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History J.W Smit, director of Contemporary Civilization, say that ideally, students would be presented with a number of small, wellorganized classes that treat non-Western cultures, race, and gender with the same goals and ideas as CC and Lit Hum. The science departments at Columbia are attempting a similar goal with their science requirement. The requirement is now one year, or two semesters of a science approved by the department. However, last year, in a move deplored by liberal arts students everywhere, the Committee on Instruction (one of the inordinately powerful, littleknown committees floating around this place) approved the recommendation ofthe Standing Committee on Science (yes, another one) to increase the requirement to two full years. Not even an extra semester, but a whole year. And even worse, you might not be able to take four semesters of Physics for Poets and Rocks for Jocks-you might have to take two full years of real science. This nightmare, thank goodness, will not be realized for quite some time, because, as of yet, there are not enough classes to accomodate this. But you can stop wiping the sweat off your forehead and chuckling mildly to yourself, because once administrators get an idea, they cling to it tightly like a drowning man to a lifeboat (or some such cliche). Professor of Physics David Helfand has already come up with a new class to be offered this semester which would fulfil the science requirement and create a science course with goals similar to those of CC and Lit Hum. The course, called an Introduction to Scientific Habits of Mind, attempts to give students a broad understanding of science and scientific thinking. You can find it in the blue Course Bulletin and if you like how it sounds, be the guinea pig in an educational experiment. Professor Helfand is a cool guy. In addition to this course, the biology department is hard at work developing new classes to fulfil the requirement in order to increase the science core to two years. Aren't you.thrilled? But it is questionable whether the science departments will have created enough classes in two years to increase the requirement; you may sneak through with just one year. Hold your fingers and take Physics for Poets now while you have the chance.Where we guinea pigs pay $6O for that science textbook to pay off last year's new blue awning."
148,Columbia bards gather for banquet,19 September 1990,"By Benjamin StrongEighteen poets, 14 of them Columbia College graduates, last night read to an audience of about 100 Columbia College alumni, faculty members, and administrators at a poetry dinner in the International Affairs Building. The banquet was inspired by poet Allen Ginsberg, CC'4B, who last semester told Dean of Columbia College Jack Greenberg that Columbia was the only major university that did not have a series of poetry readings. Greenberg decided to rectify the situation and hold a poetry banquet. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Kenneth Koch, who hosted the event, said the banquet would help alumni appreciate the literary accomplishments of graduates. ""Usually people who aren't poets or who aren't interested in poetry don't come to poetry rea-dings,"" he said. The purpose of the event was, ""to make the point that many Columbia graduates are accomplished poets,"" Dean of Students Roger Lehecka said. Lehecka added that despite a press release from the University Office of Public Information that said the dinner would be open to students as part of a plan to enhance residence life, the dinner primarily was meant for non-students. ""This was meant to be an event for the poets themselves and faculty and alumni,"" Lehecka said. The poets who read were all published writers who were either alumni or current or former faculty members. The poets who read were Paul Auster, CC'69; Bernard Lionel Einbond, CC'5B; Kate Farrell; Alan Feldman, CC'66; Ginsberg; JeffreyHarrison, CC'BO; Marc Kaminsky, CC'64; William Bryant Logan, CC'75; Philip Lopate, CC'64; Hilton Obenzinger, CC'69; Stephen O'Conner, CC'74; Ronald Padgett,CC'64; Louis Simpson, GS '4B; Lawrence Wieder, CC'6B; David Shapiro, CC'6B; Arnold Weinstein, and Koch. The selections read covered a wide range of topics. Auster opened the banquet with a dark humored poem that prompted laughter among the audience. Einbond read a poem he said was inspired by his past experience as a Literature Humanities professor. Obenzinger's selection, about World War n, concerned a plane crash in Times Square. Wieder read a sensual poem that overtly compared sex and horseback riding, raising more than one pair of eyebrows. Many of the poets said the dinner provided a forum for Columbia to display the talent that the school has fostered. ""It's good that Columbia is doing something about the amount of poets that have come out of the University,'' said Obenzinger. ""For me it's really a great way to come backto Columbia after 21 years."" They also said the dinner provided a reunion of sorts. ""I made friends here or in the neighborhood who I've worked with,"" Ginsberg said. ""I'm seeing people I haven't seen for 25 years,"" Feldman said, who added that he is living longer than many of his role models, a theme present in his poem' 'My Pneumonia.'' ""I'm quietly outliving all my heroes,"" Feldman said. ""This year I'm outliving D.H. Lawrence."" Greenberg could not attend the event because he was unexpectedly hospitalized [see story, page I], so Lehecka read a short speech Greenberg prepared before introducing Koch. Koch introduced each of the poets, describing their accomplishments. Many of the poets, who took Koch's classes in imaginative writing, thanked him for being an important influence on their work.HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR MOTHER: Allen Ginsberg does his best Sigmund Freud at last night's poetry banquet"
149,Spectrum Cultural balance needed in classroom,28 September 1990,"Cultural balance needed in classroomBy Sofia QuinteroAs Michael Waller implores us to ""keep 'cultural bias' out of the classroom"" (Spectator, Sept. 25), he reiterates the fact that it already exists. For someone who continually accuses the proponents of a more liberal educational program of being demagogues, Waller himself presents a position, filled with erroneous assumptions and barren rhetoric, that should suitably be delivered from a soapbox. His column is a perfect example of the Eurocentrism on which racist, sexist and other deleterious ideologies thrive. Hence, progressive circles demand cultural balance in the curricula on all educational levels. His contention that European authors ""communicate universal ideas"" is as ludicrous as the assumption that the world consists of only straight European men. Many of the ""foundations of modern society"" that Waller mistakenly attributes to Greco-Roman civilization are derived from those same cultures he insists that we should Continue to exclude. Furthermore, developments in philosophy, art and science were advanced in Africa, Asia and other areas incorrectly called the Third World centuries before any European emerged from a cave. In fact, many of the riches, intellectual and tangible, that the Europeans learned of in the East were either stolen or taken from the innovators and inventors by force. Which numerical system do we use today, Mike, the Romans' or the Arabs' ? This is not, as Waller wishes us to believe, a demagogic claim. All one has to do is put the so-called fathers of modern society in their correct historical context to see that this is an unfalsifiable truth. On the contrary, nothing has been done to prove that the curriculum Waller and others who agree with him hail as supreme is not elitist. Whether they choose to accept this or not, neither Greco-Roman nor Judeo-Christian works deserve to be called ""The Classics,"" for they are hardly representatives of intellectual and artistic masterpieces that have graced the globe. The stars that gleam off the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization syllabi are and always will be heroes solely in the western world. Just as Europeans have their core of works that formulate the principles upon which their society is built, so do Africans, Asians and other peoples whose history, culture and contributions to the human race extend farther than Allan Bloom and his ilk would care to admit. Waller also fails to provide evidence that the disrespect shown toward cultures of color in elementary and secondary school curricula does not cripple the children who belong tothese communities. Thousands of people who are products of the New York City public school system, myself included, can confidently testify that the cultural bias against people of color in public education is not limited to standardized tests. When young black boys are tracked into shop classes, young Latinas are coerced to take stenography, while white students of both sexes are encouraged to pursue rigorous math and science courses so that they can compete in the college admissions process, it is impossible to argue that their education is not being molded by deeply prejudiced perceptions. Another example that clearly illustrates that the cultural bias Waller begs us to bar from the classroom already exists is how the history and culture of people of color are distorted in the written material used. Children are taught that ChristopherColumbus was a navigational wizard without being told that he was also responsible for the complete annihilation of the Arawak Indians in his quest for gold. The United States is constantly presented as the world's guardian of democracy (of which Waller is an avid fan) when throughout its history it has repeatedly imposed in Latin America dictators such as Rafael Trujillo (Dominican Republic) and Anastasio Somoza (Nicaragua) to secure its economic interests in this area of the world. The list of omissions, contradictions and fallacies with which schoolchildren are inculcated can fill volumes, and indeed they have. Anyone who denies that children of color are persuaded to limit their aspirations and are set up to fail is either struck with complacent blindness or benefits from the present structure as it stands. Am I to assume that Michael Waller belongs to the latter group by his plentiful use of the term' 'minority?'' As he insinuates that he knows what is best for students of all colors, he obviously is unaware of the fact that by the year 2000 one out of every three schoolchildren will be a child of color. In many major cities throughout this wonderful land of representative democracy, we are far from the minority and take great offense to being labelled as such. It is quite interesting how the most vocal proponents of democracy are those who are most willing to perpetuate lies and deceptions to their advantage. When I began writing this response I was simply furious. However, bewilderment and sorrow over the amount of ignorance that is rampant in our society has joined my anger. Obviously, Waller and those who agree with him feel the way they do because they are victims of miseducation as much as the rest of us. Yet I have no sympathy for those who refuse to take it upon themselves to learn the truth. Indeed if there were a cultural balance in educational programs from the very start, the truth would always have been known and perhaps this debate would never have occurred."
150,Childrens' bookstore opens on B'way,2 October 1990,"By Danny FranklinSo you're sick of Homer and Plato, and even after Literature Humanities, you still think the greatest product of Western literature is Yertle the Turtle. The Bank Street Bookstore, specializing in children's books, opened their new location on Broadway at 112 th Street yesterday. ""The nice thing about specializing is that you can really get into a selection and offer a good quality selction and not be locked into fashion and short term phenomenon,"" said Associate Manager Jon Leach. The bookstore carries a large selection of children's fiction, fairy tales, and picture books, including Dr. Seuss, Maurice Sendak, E.B. White and Shel Silverstein. Inaddition, Bank Street also carries books on child education, child psychology and parenting. Since the bookstore is small it is able to be more responsive to customers' needs than a larger bookstore, Leach said. Most of the customers are teachers or parents. The inventory can be directed towards these people, he added. Bank Street plans to sponsor book-signings and story hours, most of which will take place on Saturday. Leach said he has been in contact with publishers and is trying to bring authors and illustrators of children's books to Bank Street. Upcoming events include book signings with Bob McGrath ofSesame Street and James Marshall, author and illustrator of the George and Martha series, Leach said. In the past, the Bank Street Bookstore was located within Bank Street College on 112 th street. The bookstore outgrew its space, Leach added, saying he is happy with the new location. ""It's lightened up the whole corner. It's kind of an oasis,"" Leach said. The new location also draws a lot of walk-by customers which the old location never drew, including Columbia students who are tired of thenassigned reading. ""You don't need to read that stuff all the time,"" Leach said.The bookstore officially opens Wednesday with a ribbon cutting ceremony starting at 3:30 p.m., to be attended by New York City Mayor David Dinkins' wife, Joyce Dinkins. Dinkins will read stories to local children to celebrate the opening.Customers say they appreciate what the bookstore has to offer. ' 'I was looking for a present for my son. I'd rather it be something he could learn from rather than merely a piece of tinsel,'' Eric Blitz said.DR. SEUSS AND PALS: The new Bank Street Bookstore, which specializes in children's books opened on Broadway yesterday."
151,Spectrum Core is threatened by watered down requirements,11 October 1990,"Core is threatened by watered down requirementsColumbia College's Extended Core requirement is a sham which both institutionalizes radicalism and dishonors the non-Western civilizations whose study it purports to encourage. Columbia, unlike Stanford, has weathered the 1980s with its Core Curriculum largely intact. However, the Extended Core fiasco is a vivid reminder that pandering to the ""politically correct"" can be institutionalized in ways much less obvious than Stanford's total capitulation to chants of ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western Culture's gotta go.""The 1990-1991 Columbia College Bulletin states that the Extended Core builds upon the traditional Core Curriculum of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and Music and Art Humanities, by ""enlarging the scope and inquiry beyond the primary Western focus of the existing courses and extending their subject matter to include problems and questions of the contemporary world."" To fiilfill this inandate, students are required to take two courses approved by one of Columbia's innumerable Deans and committees, one of which must ""involve major cultures beyond those encountered in the core."" There are two problems with all of this seemingly high-minded educational rhetoric. The first problem is that the Extended Core is at odds with the educational principle that underlies the Core itself: to teach, in Matthew Arnold's memorable phrase, ""the best that has been thought and done.'' That indeed is thewhole point of the Core, and the reason it has produced such fierce anger; it is designed to represent the best of Western civilization in literature, political theory, philosophy, music, and art. The Extended Core makes no such claim, and, as a result, does not represent the best of non-Western civilizations or of anything else, but in large part simply whatever happens to be taught in a particular semester. As a result, there is an implication that ANYTHING non-Western is suitable to stand alongside Aeschylus and Raphael: this clearly covers such courses as W3145 'Third World Cinema,' W3560 'Latin American Politics,' and V 3715 'Persons/selves a comparative perspective.' This juxtaposition both degrades the very idea of excellence, and deprives students of the chance to discover the very real achievements of non-Western civilizations. In many cases, this also serves to reinforce the preconceptions held by many students about the inferiority of non-Western culture. Yet even this not so trivial slight to the actual merit of non-Western cultures pales next to the so called 'Contemporary Issues Option' in the Extended Core. Though alluded to, this option is not mentioned at all in the 1990-1991 Columbia College Bulletin. It rather is to be found on the last two pages of the most recent (September 1990) 'Extended Core Requirement Approved Course List,' courses and may be used to satisfy one semester of the Extended Core Requirement. These courses are nothing but ventures in how to be 'politically correct' on a wide variety of issues, ranging from the nebulous --V3127 'Personal relations'— to the socio-logical --C3932 'Social hierarchies in the contemporary West'-- with stops along the way for revisionist history~W3Blo 'The Vietnamese revolution and its associated wars'— and the cutting edge --C3178 'lntroduction to Gender.' I have no objection to the study of these topics. But they do not belong in a general j education curriculum, being as they are at once too specialized and too topical. Moreover, the titles of the courses indicate an avowedly leftist agenda in the background that is all the more offensive because it is so blatant. There can be no doubt; the 'Contemporary Issues Option' is really an injunction to studyin depth the radical propaganda that is the common fare of campus life today. To restore the Extended Core to credibility, two steps must be taken: the Contemporary Issues Option must be completely eliminated, and the list of courses offered in satisfaction of the requirement must be stripped both of courses on the list because of convenience,and of courses there because of politics. Only then can the Extended Core receive anything but knowing smiles from the left and knowing sneers from the right.Right on Edward Lipman"
152,Ten endowed professorships named,30 November 1990,"By Catherine Thorpe Spectator Staff WriterUniversity President Michael Sovern yesterday announced the establishment of 10 new endowed professorships at a Low Library ceremony that was attended by 250 administrators, students, and faculty members.The professorships are funded by $22 million in donations and are the first announced major gifts since the kickoff of the University' s $1.15 billion capital campaign in September. Sovem also announced the creation of a $lO million ""challenge gift"" that will be used to match on a one-for-two basis donations for anadditional 20 chairs. The money comes from the estate of Lucy Moses, which also funded one of the 10 announced professorships. Moses, the wife of Henry Moses, CC 'O2, bequeathed $l5 million ofher $2OO million estate, to Columbia for scholarships and professorships, with $3 million earmarked for the Law School. Mrs. Moses died on Aug. 2 at age 103. ""The primary mission of Columbia today and tomorrow, as it was yesterday, is to teach,"" Sovern said. ""Even as we approach the 20th century ... we cherish the great teachers and we always will."" Plans are under way to expand the faculty-in-residence program in undergraduate dormitories and to establish an apprenticeship system for graduate students with eminent faculty members to cultivate teaching skills, according to Sovem, who said he has attended meetings of an adhoc seminar on teaching with University Provost Jonathan Cole, Vice President for the Arts and Sciences Martin Meisel, Vice President for the Health Sciences Herbert Pardes, and others. ""We have been reflecting together and sharing experiences,"" Sovern said. Sovern said the University must not allow teaching to be subsumed by research. ""The great teacher is an endangered species,"" he said. ""Here at Columbia we are taking actions as conservationists."" ""Teaching is our vocation, students our legacy,"" he added. Two of the announced professorships were funded by University Trustee Vincent Carrozza, CC '49, for the Lionel Trilling Professorship in the Humanities which will be held by Professor of English and Comparative Literature Edward Tayler, and The Jacques Barzun Professorship in History and the Social Sciences, which will be held by Professor of History Kenneth Jackson. Both Trilling and Barzun were professors at Columbia, and Barzun served as University provost. The Lucy G. Moses Professorship, funded by the Moses estate, will be held by the dean of Columbia College, with Jack Greenberg as its first occupant. The James F. Bender Professorship in Psychology, funded by Professor of Psychology James Bender, will be held by Professor of Psychology and former Vice President for the Arts and Sciences Donald Hood.The Ann Parsons Bender Professorship in Music, also funded by Bender, will be held by Music Department Chair lan Bent, a medieval music specialist. The estate of Journalism School alumnus H. Gordon Garbedian funded the Anna S. Garbedian Professorship in the Humanities, which will be held by Professor of Art History Richard Brilliant, and the H. Gordon Garbedian Professorship in English and Comparative Literature, which will be first held by Professor of English and Comparative Literature Austin Quigley. Morris A. Schapiro, the major donor for Schapiro Hall dormitory, funded the Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professorship in History, to be held by Professor of History Caroline Bynam, and the Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professorship, to be held by the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science when one fills the now-vacant position. The William Theodore and Fannie B. deßary and Class of '4l Professorship in Oriental Humanities, whose first holder is yet to be named, was established through gifts from the friends of John Mitchell Mason Professoi William Theodore deßary and his wife. The Jesse and George Siegel Professorship in the Humanities, established through a gifi by Jesse Siegel, CC '49, will be held by Professor of Slavic Languages Robert Belknap, who is chair of the Literature Humanities program. Professor Jackson, as one of the newlyappointed chairs, said great teachers work hard to stir students out of apathy. ""They force students to think,"" he said. ""In expanding student horizons they enrich student lives."" Teachers should also recognize that they learn from students, and that their own efforts may go unrecognized, Jackson said. ""They realize they learn as much from students as student learn from them,"" he said. ""Students teach and teachers learn."" Jackson noted that most talented Columbia professors are not well recognized. ""Most of them labor in relative obscurity,"" he said. ""These good teachers are known only by the students.""WHAT A VIEW: Jazzman Wynton Marsalis joined Schapiro Hall residents for supper and conversation last night in the dormitory's penthouse suite."
153,Letters,6 December 1990,"BOM defended To the Editor: While the Board of Managers (BOM) respects the right of Spectator's editorial staff to criticize our programming, its editorial (""Better BOM,"" Dec. 3) contained numerous errors about BOM's structure and operation First, there were some factual errors. There are nine people on the board, not six, as you stated: a four member executive committee and five committee heads. We are funded by the Joint Budgetary and Calendaring Committee directly from student activities fees, not from the Columbia College Student Council's funds. We also have co-sponsored numerous events with other campus events, including the Queen Latifah concert, co-sponsored by, among others, the Black Students Organization, the Lesbian Bisexual and Gay Coalition (LBGC), the United Minorities Board, Earl Hall and the Columbia College Women's Center, and a forthcoming screening of the film ""Longtime Companion,"" co-sponsored with LBGC. We hold a general meeting for all interested students every September, but these meetings are poorly attended, despite our highly visible events. More distressingly, your editorial reflected a fundamental misunderstanding about BOM's structure. BOM consists of several largely autonomous committees, united under a common funding mechanism. BOM does not control the programming decisions of the committees that comprise it. The committees make every effort to gauge student interest in their events. Since committees rely almost exclusively on box-office receipts to make ends meet, good attendance is vital. If people are not interested in our programming, how is it possible that so many of our films, Comedy Cabarets and concerts are so well-attended? We feel that we are very accountable to student interests. We are always open to students' suggestions (put them in our mailbox outside 206 FBH, or call us at x 43600). Anyone who is interested and willing to put in some work is welcome to join a committee. We have over 100 active committee members at this time. BOM is a democratic organization: executive committee members are elected in a general meeting, and committee officers are elected each year by the committees. Anyone who is unhappy with BOM's programming can join a committee at any time and can have a say in it. Since you brought it up, we will answer the more specific comments about the Professor Griff/Maya Angelou controversy. As a reaction to widespread protests about Professor Griff, the previous board responded to student feelings by withdrawing their funds, but there is no point in arguing about these events now. Those decisions were not made by the current board. There is interest in the A 1 Sharpton lecture, from both his supporters and his detractors. We hope people will come to hear what he has to say, even though they may not agree with his views. We should reserve judgment until we have heard the man out. The purpose of the BOM Lectures Committee is to schedule interesting, even controversial, lectures by public figures. The committee's budget for the 1990-91 year is roughly $12,000, and the Sharpton/Maddox lecture is only a small portion of this budget. Even if it was possible to bring only safe, noncontroversial speakers, we would not attract the interest of the student body, and no one would come to our lectures. The Board of Managers: Andrew Katz, CC '9O/SEAS '9l, Jill Weissman, BC '9l, David J. Lidsky, CC '9l, liana Porat, CC '9l, Vanessa Cole, SEAS '9l, Jed Meyer, CC '92, Richard Rosivach, CC '9l, Steve Taub, SEAS '9l, Cynthia Young, CC '9l Speaker mocks CU To the Editor: Who is Minister Dr. Khallid Abdul Muhammad? What weight should we give to his opinions, or to his insulting and painful rhetoric (""Jewniversity"")? The article on his talk in the Dec. 3 issue of Spectator runs a photo provided by man and quotes his poster verbatim in describing him as ""a recipient of the Ford Foundation Fellowship to study atColumbia, Harvard and Yale."" Did Spectator look into these claims, try to discover the origin of his ""doctorate,"" or in any other way attempt any independent journalism here? It does not seem so. Setting Spectator's laziness aside, the difficulty this person presents our University is not reduced by his credentials, whatever they may be. A group of our students invited him, and paid him, to make these statements to us all. If they were reported accurately, they insulted us all, mocking our University and all of its citizens. What do my colleagues have to say in response? Shall we let it go by a ""Black event,"" thereby passing back the insult implicit in any summary judgment of a group by its skin color, and presuming on the opinions of an important section of our student body? Not me. This person had every right to speak, and I have every right to condemn his hurtful, erroneous, inflammatory words. And I do. Who—of any race or religion—will join me? Robert Pollack, CC '6l Professor of Biological Sciences Dean Emeritus, Columbia College Sticks and stones... To the Editor: I have an idea. As a white, Jewish American I'll just stand in the middle of a circle comprising Professor Griff, Lisa Williamson, Khallid Abdul Muhammad and assorted members of the Black Students Organization and let them all hurl large stones at me. From recent events and statements made on this campus, I gather this will be a good cheap method of making these people feel good. Rachel Stoll, CC '92 Attack all bigotry To the Editor: It is disheartening to read of yet another campus speaker who had addressed this community with a message of hatred, prejudice and intolerance. Racial bigotry must be deplored whenever it occurs, regardless of the source or the target. Khallid Abdul Muhammad's references to ""Columbia Jewniversity"" in ""Jew York City"" and his other disparaging remarks about non-blacks are distasteful to all those who promote tolerance and mutual respect. Beyond our outrage at this specific incident, however, lies a greater issue. Muhammad is just one of the several speakers recently invited by the Black Students Organization (BSO) who have fostered this ideology of prejudice and hatred. If it is the intent of the BSO to send the Columbia community a message other than one of intolerance towards non-blacks, their message is unclear. The deprecation of any group of people as a means to assert oneself is intolerable. Of course, we acknowledge that speakers invited to campus do not necessarily reflect the views of the organizations that sponsor them. However, the BSO's refusal to publicly disassociate itself from the hate-filled statements by its speakers leads us to the conclusion that, at best, the organization is indifferent to the vilification of others. If our goal is an atmosphere of tolerance and respect in which we may address issues of concern, we must separate our legitimate grievances from rhetoric of hatred. Executive Board of the Jewish Student Union: Tracie Beberman, GS/JTS '92, Joshua Leibowitz, CC '9l, Stephanie Newman, BC '9l, Saul Richter, CC '92, Rob Scheinberg, CC '9l, Joel Wine, CC '9l, Mary Zamore, CC '9l Teach civic values To the Editor: I am writing in reference to the article describing the address by Khallid Abdul. What bothered me so about this article was what one Barnard student is reported to have said in response to the speech:' 'Muhammad's beliefs are very enlightening and clarifies [sic] many questions that black students and future scholars need to address and define in order to full 'know thyself."" I am disappointed that a young person who is bright enough to attend Barnard College isso disaffected with American society that she can find enlightenment in the miscellaneous ramblings of this self-confessed anti-Ameri-can revolutionary? Enlightenment? This is a man who is able to use the phrase ""Columbia Jewniversity"" and, at the same time, assert neither that he is an anti-Semite or that he knows any Jews on campus who should be angry with him. However, I will not dwell on his anti-Semitism. His self-denial cloaks far more hatred and mistrust than even his pejorative comments reveal. I focus my thoughts primarily on his belief that ""blacks cannot consider themselves American because they have never reaped the benefits of being American."" The mere fact that he is able to make such statements in public and receive applause rather than censure is the greatest testament to the benefits that all Americans receive regardless of race, gender or ethnicity. If the Barnard student who was quoted finds enlightenment in this statement, then we as a society have failed her. Through a primary and secondary educational system that fears traditional values more than it fears anarchy and revolution, we have failed to provide her with the ideals upon which this nation was founded. Through a higher education system in which it is far easier to find courses that teach Marxism than courses that teach civic responsibility, we have failed to provide an environment in which students are challenged to heed John F. Kennedy's advice. I do not blame Muhammad for this student's disaffection. I blame an educational system that has retreated from the values which once bound us as a nation and left a void in the hearts and minds of our young people. As long as we allow this vacuum to persist, something will come along to fill it. If it is not the ideas of Muhammad, then it will be something else, perhaps worse. How long can we allow this to continue? Barry Sugarman Ph.D. candidate, Teachers College Aft'. ' i Don't jump the gun To the Editor: In the recent article ""NRA supporters blast gun control and call it a failed idea'' (Nov. 15) you report on a panel discussion sponsored by the College Republicans with speakers from the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and New York Court Officials. The article is filled with quotes by NRA representative Kevin Starell, including: ""gun control is morally repugnant and practically unworkable,"" and ""if you look at the statistics, guns in the hands of honest people do protect the people who are using them."" By printing such rhetoric without including an alternate point of view, Spectator is guilty of bias by omission and is committing a serious disservice to its readers. A minimum of research, by either your staff or any rational person, would reveal very different statistics. The United States has perhaps the weakest handgun control laws of any other Western industrialized nation. As a result, it has grossly disproportionate number of handgun homicides. In 1988, 8915 people were murdered by handguns in the United States. In Canada, the number was eight, and in Britain the number was seven. This is contrary to what the NRA and Starell maintain-that weak gun laws protect us by allowing us to arm ourselves. Starell further tries to persuade us that a seven-day mandatory waiting period for the purchase of a handgun is useless, because a standard FBI fingerprint check takes 22 days. He purposely ignores the fact that the purpose of the waiting period is not to match fingerprints, but to check for such things as previous felony convictions. In 1989, Maryland stopped over 1500 dangerous handgun sales by effectively employing a seven-day waiting period. Having a waiting period to purchase a lethal weapon also makes good common sense, since most murders are impulsive acts. Rather than eliminating the waiting period, as Starell suggests, we should adopt a longer, nationwide waiting period. There are numerous statistics that argue for the need for stronger gun control. Every year, over 1200 Americans are accidentally shot with a handgun. Ten children are killed every day in this country by handguns. Every threehours an American teenager commits suicide with a handgun. Starell claims, ""Usually people who are opposed to guns don't know anything about guns."" I fired my first gun at age 14 at a Boy Scout shooting competition. This is different. Handguns are made to kill people. If you need proof, I invite you to come up to my neighborhood in Washington Heights, or visit me where I sometimes work, in the Emergency Room of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. If you are too busy to make the trip, at least become informed. Two alternate sources of information are the NRA (800-368-5714) and Handgun Control (202-898-0792) Compare the data and reach your own conclusion. I did. Emil Chynn College of Physicians & Surgeons, '92 CCSC fails to do job To the Editor: I'm writing this to express the frustration and anger that I felt when I read the articles ""Council says CU should not build biomed. center"" and ""CU should seek alternative Audubon plan"" (Spectator, Nov. 29). The articles clearly demonstrate the self-patroniz-ing liberal for the sake of being liberal attitude which, unfortunately, is the mark of the Columbia College Student Council (CCSC). The council is supposed to represent the interests of the students but it falls short of doing so on this issue. Crump states that the plans to build the biomedical center at the proposed site is ""environmentally unsound, clearly profit motivated, and smacks of racism."" It seems that it is the minds of CCSC officials and the so-called resolution which is ""unsound,"" ' 'clearly motivated'' b> few radical activists (and then the rest of tie council mindlessly jumped on the ""liberal bandwagon""). The resolution as presented in Crump's article ""smacks"" of yellow journalism. The biomedical research center would not be some horrible monster spewing harmful biological waste into the land, water or air as the CCSC would have us believe. The environmental impact of the research center has been studied extensively and does not pose a threat to the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness for all involved. Rather, the building's present deplorable condition, besides being an eye sore, is actually a health and fire hazard. Crump also cries ""every community has the right to self determination."" Since when has this been a ""right,"" and if it is then what about the right of Columbia (which is a sizable member of that community) to determine what it wants to do with what is their property? The research center would also create many jobs for the people who live in the neighborhood and would increase business in the local stores and restaurants. In general it would give quite a boost to the Washington Heights economy, which it can use. The research that would take place at the biomedical center could produce unimaginably beneficial findings that would not only help the residents of both the Washington Heights and Columbia communities, but the entire world. If the center is not built, it will be a tragic loss for the world community. The reasons for the passing of this resolution are, at best illegitimate. The council has made issues out of non-issues, created certain ""inalienable"" rights out of non-issues, created certain ""inalienable"" rights of a community and then selectively and prejudicially applied these rights in favor of their point of view, and used some less than ethical journalistic techniques to paint a grossly distorted image of the biomedical center. Finally, council members have failed to represent the students at Columbia. To have completely misrepresented the views of the group of students who feel the same way I do (and mind you, we are not the small minority that the CCSC incorrectly believes us to be) is simply inexcusable, and I suggest that the council reconsider their actions. In the future when making such ""resolutions"" and using what limited powers it has, the council should do so in a more appropriate and responsible manner in which they are truly representative. Steven M. Fried, SEAS '92Learn your pronouns To the Editor: Nancy Coffin's Nov. 12 letter contained lies which were slanderous to me. To clear up matters, people must know what happened: Ms. Coffin was the representative at the Arab Association's table on Clubs Day. I spoke with her extensively about a proposal by Student Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (SOJAC): The Arab Association and SOJAC should cosponsor cultural events. It seemed that by coming together to emphasize similarities, the two groups could reduce Arab-Jewish tensions. The first SOJAC cultural event was ""Sounds of the Jewish High Holy Days in Arab Lands."" SOJAC hoped the Arab Association would cosponsor. Ms. Coffin encouraged me to attend the first Arab Association meeting. Unfortunately, it was on Rosh Hashana; so I was unable to go. I thus wrote up SOJAC's proposal, and Ms. Coffin took it to present to the Arab Association. A few days later, Ms. Coffin called me.' 'They didn't want to do it,"" she said. One reason she gave was that ""singing Jewish songs to Arab tunes is taking possession of the Arab culture."" Of course, this display of culture imperialism could not be tolerated. I thus wrote my original letter to Spectator (Oct. 15). The week my letter appeared, two members of the Arab Association approached me. They stated that in fact, association members never said they would not cosponsor SOJAC's event. On Nov. 12, two months after I spoke with Ms. Coffin, Ms. Coffin wrote an' 'open letter'' to me, via the paper. In this letter, she finally admitted that in fact, the Arab Association never did discuss my letter. In addition, she insinuated that I knew this information all along: ""Your taking my words out of context and misrepresenting my statement as official Arab Association policy seems to me to be a blatant attempt to defame the Association."" Tell me, Ms. Coffin: Do you always refer to yourself as ' 'They?"" I will not speculate on Ms. Coffin's motives for her behavior. I certainly hope this incident boils down to a poor choice in pronouns. Whether or not it does, people should realize that it is the doing of one individual, not of the Arab Association itself. Along this line, the SOJAC board and I are relieved to know that the Arab Assocation in fact did not reject SOJAC's proposal or make the mentioned slur. We look forward to joining together on future events. Loolwa Khazzoom, BC'9l founder/chair, SOJAC BBH not into building To the Editor: Your very fine article about the proposed Center for Jewish Life (Spectator, Nov. 1) contained an important factual error. You incorrectly stated that 30 percent of the funds needed for the project will be contributed by B'nai B'rith Hillel/Jewish Association for College Youth (BBH/JACY). That is not the case. Funding for the project has been assumed by the Jewish Campus Life Fund, Inc., the Columbia alumni foundation that sponsors Jewish activities on campus. Since 1929 the fund has been responsible for the staff and program of the Jewish Office at Columbia. In recent years, BBH/JACY has become a wonderful partner with the Fund and has provided 30 percent of the resources needed for the Jewish Office staff and the Jewish Student Union program. BBH/JACY has not assumed a 30 percent responsibility for the projected Center for Jewish Life. Rabbi Charles Sheer Geographism too To the Editor: While applauding Spectator on its stand against sexism, homophobia, racism, and even classism, I must also voice my concern about an equally vicious ""ism"" of which Spectator itself is often guilty: ""geographism."" Geographists seem to collect at pretentious Ivy League institutions, earning their title by belittling those from what the geographists conside to be ""lesser"" areas of thecountry. Among graduate students, geographists also tow the elitist line, by deriding those who did not attend private undergraduate universities. While the cartoon ""Absurdity of Life"" in the Nov. 16 issue sought to comment on the important issue of sexist language, it promoted geographist views by mocking my own hometown of Tucson, Arizona. Of course, being open minded, I can understand why someone in New York would think that' 'eating hot dogs and enjoying baseball in Tuscon [sic], Arizona"" has less social value than sitting at a trendy bar clothed in black, sipping mineral water, and discussing ""politically correct"" issues while the homeless stand outside in the cold. But, then again, while Tucson does have trendy bars, a few people who wear only black (undertakers and priests), and perhaps one person who buys Evian (a former New Yorker), Tucsonans don't have to exalt themselves by mocking other areas. Further, instead of watching life, we live it, and because of the excellent climate, nobody is left in the cold. Brian Fortman Columbia Law School '9l Salute to Ceresney To the Editor: I am writing to you so that I may publicly applaud the actions of Columbia College Representative-at-Large Andrew Ceresney, CC '93, who recently voted against a CCSC resolution opposing the construction of the new biomedical research facility. My praise however, has nothing to do with the facility itsef. In his three semesters on the Student Council, Ceresney has refused to fall victim to the ""Politically Correct"" mentality which enslaves such a large portion of this campus. While other student-politicians feel the need to cater to special interest groups in order to preserve their image as being ""PC,"" Ceresney has consistently been true to his beliefs and the beliefs of his constituents. Contrary to popular belief, this campus is not a homogeneous political community. There are many students who do not readily subscribe to the liberally-biased conventional wisdom which has dominated Columbia for the past several decades. Unfortunately, these students are frequently written off as either racist or insensitive; rarely are their voices heard. Rather than subscribe to the conventional wisdom, Ceresney has placed himself above the frequently depressing state of Columbia College politics. Ceresney understands that there are many Columbia students concerned with practical solutions to our community's problems and that these solutions need not be ideologically based. Ceresney has and will continue to provide effective, responsible and accurate representation for the many Columbia students more concerned with solutions than politics. For that, I salute and thank Andrew. Erik Tischler, CC '92 Core's essence is change To the Editor: Once again, I feel I must take issue with some of the misconceptions that are expressed about Columbia College's Core Curriculum. In your editorial of Nov. 20, you commend Asian Americans Working for Education (AAWE) for its efforts to place a course in Asian American studies on Barnard's curriculum. Specifically, you praise them for ""chipping at the core"" (the editorial's title), implying that Asian American studies represent something necessarily ""other"" than the traditional Core Curriculum. What is also implicit in this statement of congratulations is the entirely false notion that the Core Curriculum represents an unchanging monolith—a stodgy and inflexible tradition—that needs to be chipped at. Nothing, in fact, is farther from the truth. What is remarkable about the Core Curriculum is exactly its tradition of change. Very little of the syllabus of today's Contemporary Civilization is similar to the first version of the course offered in the 1919-20 academic year. Indeed, in the words of Professor Justus Buchler, Contem-porary Civilization ""was literally born revising itself.'' Since 1919, countless changes have been made in the Contemporary Civilization course as well as the other courses in the Core Curriculum. Indeed, we do not even take a second year of CC, as Columbia College students did from 1929 until 1960. The establishment of the Extended Core in 1988 was only the most recent in a series of changes that have kept the Core Curriculum up-to-date and thus vital. Change in the Core Curriculum is undoubtedly a good thing—it is what preserves the original intent of the fathers (yes, they were all men) of the Core. Change means that the Core will always attempt to teach Columbia College students how to understand the culture in which they live. The second misconception in the editorial is the idea that there is a connection between the names of the authors on the facade of Butler Library and the Core Curriculum (specifically, Literature Humanities): ""changing an established curriculum at Columbia can seem as laborious as chipping another set of names onto the facade of Butler Library."" This connection is entirely specious. Butler Library was built in 1934, fully three years before Literature Humanities was established as ""Humanities A"" in 1937. Certainly, both the Butler facade and the Lit. Hum. course make overt references to the canon of works by the ""great authors,"" but any relationship between the two Columbia institutions is purely coincidental. The errors I have indicated are by no means major, and do not significantly alter the main point of the editorial. Still, I feel compelled to correct them because I believe that my corrections will go a long way in clarifying the ever-present and ever-heated argument over the merits of the Core Curriculum. Misconceptions such as the idea that the Core is an entrenched and unyielding fixture at Columbia only cloud the issue and prevent rational debate on the subject. David Kaufman, CC '9l (The author recently wrote a lengthy monograph on the origins of the Core Curriculum at Columbia College for the National Endowment for the Humanities and wishes to point out that he is one-half Asian by descent.) Soul search at Spec? To the Editor: Historically, Jews have found that misdirected and misunderstood knowledge can yield tragedy. We need not cite more than the burning of the Talmud in France and the Nachmanides Debate, events triggered by Jewish converts to Christianity. While I would not place Laura Shaw in such a category, I would like to comment that as a religious Jew, I was quite offended by her piece of Nov. 26, ""Jewish Women Hear Muffled Voice."" My gripe is not directed at her feminism, nor towards her feelings. The search for a religious self and identity is a difficult one. It is not a unique or new one, but, it is also not a discussion fit for the pages of the Spectator (no disrespect to the publication intended). Shaw says she is religious, and while arguably she does not mean Orthodox, her textual proofs certainly show such a bias. Yet, she speaks of a male viewpoint in the writing of the Torah, a view that is meaningless to 3500 years of belief that Moses was only God's pen. Furthermore, she cites Midrash, or legend. While these texts do exist, there exists a large rift among scholars as to how these legends apply to everyday life. Finally, she cites the Amidah, the Silent Devotion, as a masculine chronological tool to mention the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. If Shaw understood this prayer properly, she would realize it is not chronological at all. It is merely a tool used to highlight the different attributes of God exemplified by these individuals. Her own invented prayer therefore need not be chronological. There is a time and place for religious soul searching. It is a task that minimally be undertaken with guidance and accompaniment from more knowledgeable scholars. It certainly does not belong as a single misguided voice on the pages of the Spectator. Joseph Wolf, SEAS '92Campaign corrections To the Editor: Because one article and an editorial contain factual errors about the status of the New Campaign for Columbia, I respectfully ask that you print this letter in its entirety. First, the New Campaign goal is $1.15 billion, not $1.5 billion, as you reported in Monday' s edition. Second, the pledge balance of the University is $l2O, not $l2 million as you reported in the same paper. Third, in you editorial of Nov. 14, you stated that the $330 million raised since 1988 does not represent funds that have been raised under the current campaign, and that Mr. Kluge's gift is the only money collected under the current campaign. Both statements are incorrect. Kluge's gift of $25 million is included in the $330 million total, and every penny of the $330 million is included in the current Campaigning total raised to date. Peter McE. Buchanan Former Vice President for University Development and Alumni Relations Nat'l guard not militia To the Editor: I am writing in response to a letter from Peter C. Richter (Spectator Letters Nov. 27) concerning his support of gun control and interpretation of the second amendment. First I will mention that it is quite obvious from your letter that you did not actually attend the presentation itself. The second amendment was extensively dealt with by the speakers, including the ""well-regulated militia"" phrase you claim the gun lobby fails to acknowledge. As a law graduate you must know that the Bill of Rights was put in the Constitution to protect the people from the government. Therefore, the militia of the authors of the Bill of Rights cannot be part of the government. Please read Perpich v. Department of Defense, a U.S. Supreme Court decision from June 1990. The Court held that the National Guard is not the Constitutional militia, since it is funded by the national government and always subject to the president's orders. Even current Federal law follows the Founder's definition of a people's militia (Militia Act 1792). Please read Title 10 U.S. Code section 311. A ""well-regulated Militia"" is not the National Guard as you assumed. The fact that the Founding Fathers did intend the second amendment to also protect the right of personal self-defense, is obvious from the debates in the U.S. Senate on Sept. 9, 1789 when they refused a motion to add the phrase ""for the common defense"" after the phrase ' 'to keep and bear arms"" in the second amendment. Please don't believe what I or anyone else would tell you on this subject. You are fortunate enough to be attending a university which has excellent libraries and research centers available to you. I'm sure you are aware of this since you are in the School of Library Service. Do your own research, and discover the facts for yourself. Glen Morgan, CC '93 Chair, College Republicans at Columbia Stones not the issue To the Editor: One minor note on Jonathan Sopher's editorial: when Einstein said that the next war would be fought with stone, he meant to warn that the use of nuclear weapons (in WWII) would put us back in the Stone Age. The effectiveness of stones as weapons was not at all the issue. In a more serious vein, before condemning either side in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, consider something closer to home. How would you react if the Native Americans who lived in your home town less than 500 (not 1500) years ago, came back and demanded that you make space for them and follow their system of government. No matter how good the Israelis claim to the land may be, I cannot fault the Palestinians for resenting the intrusion. Methods on both sides are a different question entirely, and one I am not qualified to discuss. Jennifer Broekman, CC '93"
154,BCAWC urges day of alternative ed.,20 February 1991,"By Elizabeth Berke Spectator Staff WriterThe Barnard/Columbia AntiWar Coalition (BCAWC) is planning a day of alternative education centered around the anti-war movement tomorrow. The day will include a day-long teach-in, a rally, and a march to City Hall. BCAWC sent letters to faculty members last Wednesday requesting that they devote classroom time on Thursday to discussions about the war, or that they attend the teach-in which will be held in John Jay Lounge from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., according to BCAWC member Marc Rosenblum, CC '91. ' 'I have personally talked to four faculty members who all planned to at least devote class time to wardiscussions, and some are going to the teach-in. I know there are more teachers planning to go [to the teach-in] than I have personally talked to,"" Rosenblum said. ""By talking to students, I have learned that quite a few faculty members have raised [war discussions] in their classrooms,"" he added. Literature Humanities Instructor Douglas Mikkelson said he plans to devote half of his Literature Humanities class to discussions about the war, but added he is doing sobecause of a student request. Mikkelson added that he did not receive a letter from BCAWC. Rosenblum said members of Faculty and Staff Concerned About the Gulf War have been supportive of BCAWC's plans for Thursday. Dewitt Clinton Professor of History Eric Foner, a member of Faculty and Staff Concerned About the Gulf War, said his group endorses Thursday's moratorium. ""We have urged faculty to comply with the ideas behind nothaving business as usual and turning classroom discussions to the war,"" Foner said, adding that although he does not teach classes on Thursday, he is giving his teaching assistants the opportunity to devote their discussion sections to the war. Wang said Students Mobilized Against Saddam Hussein (SMASH) was not asked to co-sponsor the events because the focus will be anti-war. ' 'This [moratorium] has nothing to do with SMASH as far as we're concerned,"" Wang said. ""The teach-in will be completely anti-war, but the classroom discussions will be non-partisan."" National Chair of SMASH Glen Morgan, CC '93, said SMASH has not planned any events for Thursday, but may hold a counter rally to the BCAWC rally scheduled for noon. ' 'I'm not sure it's worth doing anything about. It depends on whether the media shows up or not,"" Morgan said. ""It seems like a desperate move. The [anti-war] movement lost its momentum in the streets, speaking from my biased viewpoint,"" he added."
155,Spectrum Columbia tries to indoctrinate anti-religious sentiment,4 April 1991,"Columbia tries to indoctrinate anti-religious sentimentFor the self-selecting few at Columbia who believe in God, this past weekend was a particularly holy time. Here and there on the mount of Morningside were to be found devout, God-fearing Jews and Christians worshipping the Lord and keeping the holidays of Passover and Easter as did their ancestors of old.Why were these young believers so few in number? To be sure, religion is currently out of fashion. For one thing, it is not Politically Correct, and for good reason. Although P.C. propagandists of all stripes are quick to tout Eastern and African religions, an objective study would reveal that many of these religions are in reality far more anti-P.C. than anything ever dreamt of in the most fundamentalist enclave of Christendom or in the most reactionary of Orthodox Jewish sects. However, as long as these favored exotic religions remain untouched by such objective study, the Judeo-Christian tradition common to most of us will remain the epitome of the un-Politically Correct. But' 'out of fashion'' is hardly a fitting way to describe the venomous contempt in which religion is held on campus. An institution once charged with safeguarding religion now takes pride in destroying it: all over Columbia, in the classroom, in the dean's office, in the dormitories, belief in God and observance of His law are everywhere under attack. This mandatory godlessness begins thevery day a first-year student arrives at Columbia. Since classes do not begin for a week, intellectual indoctrination is deferred and this first week of orientation is given over to lessons in P.C. sexual ethics. Everywhere are condoms, flyers hawking free abortion, and mandatory instructions—with live demonstrations—on how to perform safe sex. Should a student dare to respond in keeping with his or her upbringing, the outcry is deafening. One student I know was actually brought up on charges before the deans (the charges were later dropped) for responding ""inappropriately"" to an ""information"" session conducted during orientation by the Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Coalition; the offense was the mention of the relevant teachings of Christianity on the subject. Another student was forced by her residence counselor to attend a meeting of ""Dr. Whoopie"" in which similar demonstrations (complete with bananas) were given; she had tried to lock herself in her room, attempting to abide by her upbringing as a devout Catholic. Most first-year students take either Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization (C.C.). It is here that they will first be taught why they should not believe in God, or, if they already do, they will be taught how to un-believe. For here, students learn that the Bible is merely one of a number of ""texts,"" possessed of no particular ""validity."" My own C.C. instructor informed the class that his goal as a teacher was to ""destroy all of the prejudices with which we came to Columbia."" Minutes later it became only too clear that among the prejudices in question were belief in God, the family, and democracy.Another C.C. instructor once told me that he thought that all religion was meaningless and indeed, harmful superstition. Upon questioning, he admitted that he does not hesitate to air this opinion in his classroom. It is possible that for some students a nihilist attack on their religious faith may indeed only strengthen it. But for most students, belief has not a chance against the combined forces arrayed against it in the Columbia classroom. First, the teacher is an authority figure whom the student is expected to defer to. Peer pressure is also a powerful force in the classroom, a force that~in this school, atleast—will always be on the side of atheism. Then too, the burden of proof is put on the student to support his or her belief, whereas the teacher and the other students need put nothing forward but their criticisms. Were that not enough, the student is greatly outnumbered. And to add insult to injury, the P.C. patrol stands ready to gag the student if he or she should overstep the limits of ""civility"" in defense of their views. My quarrel is not with the fundamental secular nature of Columbia. It is rather with those who actually discriminate against belief from their positions of power, whether in the classroom, Low Library, or the Deans' Office. No Committee on Civility can ever change the reality that belief in God and in His law is not, has never been, and never will be P.C.-for P.C. is its own belief. I am amazed by the arrogance with which administrators and teachers treat the religiousbeliefs of students. One is reminded of the opening of Plato's Euthyphro, where Socrates remarks: ""Good heavens! How little, Euthyphro, does the common herd know of the nature of right and truth! A man must be an extraordinary man, and have made great strides in wisdom, before he could have seen his way to this!"" Apparently our administrators and teachers do indeed feel that they have made ""great strides in wisdom,"" for not only have they cast aside the Judeo-Christian tradition, but they seem intent on persecuting those who yet cling to it.Right on Edward LipmanEdward Lipman is a Columbia College senior."
156,Make Columbia a recommendable institution,15 May 1991,"By Edward LipmanStrange things happen to graduating seniors. Not being a scientist (or a philosopher), I will not try to give an explanation of these odd occurrences. I shall simply relate the facts. About a week ago I found myself at a cocktail party discussing life and happiness with a high school junior from Pennsylvania. Without any conscious desire to do so, I began to do something that readers of my column would think unlikely from the author of ""Right on"": I endeavored to convince this intelligent, well-mannered, and attractive young lady to apply to Columbia! In itself, this might not be so startling; it could, among other things, be put down to the wily machinations of Messrs. Johnny Walker and Jim Beam (the occasion in question was, after all, a cocktail party). But several days later, I discovered a missive from the Columbia alumni admissions people in the morning mail, containing a form letter inviting me to sign on as some sort of Columbia representative to high-schoolers in my area. Without premeditation, I eagerly scanned the letter,filled out the enclosed form, mailed it, and began looking forward to snaring New York City's best and brightest for good old Alma Mater. Can this be? The author of so many diatribes against the woeful state of Columbia becoming an honest to God booster? The man who has attacked administration, faculty, and students for their moral bankruptcy and utter disregard for learning? Yes. My purpose in my polemical columns was to try to make sure that Columbia would remain an institution worth attending. And after my four years, I can say—with somereservations-that Columbia offers an excellent education that holds its own against all comers, including the mighty Harvard. To begin with, our Core Curriculum is a real curriculum in which one reads real books in a generally straightforward fashion. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization remain challenging, serious courses where students are introduced to great worksEdward Lipman, a Spectator columnist, will graduate from Columbia College today.of philosophy, political theory, and literature. For all its faults, Logic and Rhetoric remains an intensive exercise in the writing of English prose. Music Humanities and Art Humanities remain centered upon the great music and art of Western civilization. ""Street Slang 101"" will not yet fulfill the language requirement, nd the science requirement promises to be v even better as it is expanded to two full years. But the Core is, thankfully, not all of one's education at Columbia. Much time is spent taking courses in one's major, and for the student with any scholarly inclination majors abound where the wisdom and teaching of great scholars are readily available. Though the English and history departments care too little about undergraduates and all too much \ about radical politics, small but academically outstanding departments such as classicseagerly welcome the interested student. Although the elimination of the geography and the linguistics departments is to be deplored, and no doubt indicates an alarming trend that must be fought against, scholarship is not yet dead at Columbia. Beyond the classroom there is New York. I never cease to wonder at the transformation that so many of my friends have undergone during their four years here; the intellectual and social sophistication of New York seems to leave no one untouched, even if few Columbians are to be seen in used bookstores, at the opera, or at off-off-Broadway shows. Unlike the boutique colleges (such as, let us say, Bennington), Columbia does have a diverse student body. Diverse, that is, in a good sense, not diverse in the sense of a quota-filled experiment in social engineering.I would be unfair to my Muse if I neglected to mention the bad parts of Columbia. The dorms are terrible, mostly due to the animallike habits of the students who live in them. Students who come from morally conservative backgrounds will find myriad and insistent invitations to sin that their parents could never have dreamed of when they wrote out the check to Columbia. Our school lacks the elegance and refinement still present in some measure at some of our more conspicuous Ivy brethren, and any visions prospective students have of well-dressed, intellectual undergraduates sitting around in front of a fire drinking sherry with a great scholar had better be laid to rest without further ado. Although the Core Curriculum is quite good on paper, the quality of the actual classes depends all too much on one's teachers: I, for instance, had a frightfullyrotten Music Humanities class, a horrible first semester of Physics for Poets, and an equally atrocious Logic and Rhetoric class; I also had a mediocre Contemporary Civilization class. Every other Core course that I took, however, was truly first-rate. Indeed, with the exception of two electives in addition to the abovenamed Core courses, every class I took at Columbia was first-rate. But when it comes right down to it, Columbia offered me more of an education than I ever could have taken advantage of. And for that, I trust I may be forgiven a certain sentimentality as I take leave of the Light Blue (even if I never did go to a football game or sing ""Roar, Lion, Roar""!). Right on, Columbia? Not quite, but close."
157,"The ""core"" of the Core, or Humming your way to class",29 August 1991,"By Kristina Nye and David A. Shimkin Spectator Staff WritersThe first-year class at Columbia College is usually made up of two groups of students--one that is intellectually stimulated by the prospect of two very full years of courses devoted to the ideas and accomplishments of Western civilization and one that gets queasy at the mere mention of' 'dead white men'' like Nietzche or Raphael. Whichever group you belong to, you may find it necessary to understand the purpose of the Core Curriculum and how it will effect your academic, or not-so-academic lives at Columbia. For those of you who are not familiar with the origins of the Core Curriculum, you may be interested to know that the Core has existed at Columbia for more than half a century. Starting with the inception of the Contemporary Civilization course in 1919 which dealt with war and peace issues, the Core later included Literature Humanities in 1937 and Art and Music Humanities in 1947. For all of its tradition, however, the Core sparks controversy. Some students have complained about the exclusivity of the Core and its emphasis on the accomplishments of Western males. Evidence of student opposition to this Western white male emphasis was obvious when studentssnuck onto the roof of Butler Library two years ago and unfurled a banner with about ten names of female authors such as Sappho, Jane Austen, and Virginia Wolfe to hang above the engraved names of Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, et al. Since that time, the Core has changed rapidly in an attempt to meet the needs of a changing student body. In addition to a science, foreign language, and physical education requirement, the Core in 1988 replaced the Remoteness Requirement, a requirementfor courses outside one's major, with the Extended Core, or a non-Western requirement. Of course, despite changes in the curriculum, criticism abounds. One claim is that the Extended Core's courses have a narrow focus. For example, you may want to take a course with a broad overview of Japanese culture, yet the only course offered that relates to Japanese culture is The Rise of Militarism in Japan 1900-1930. Get the picture? In response to criticism and long-winded, heated debates, Columbia has made a concerted effort within the past few years to reevaluate the Extended Core, by creating various committees, such as the Standing Committee on the Core Curriculum, to discuss changing the scope of the Core. The faculty and administration has sought to add to the Core rather than replace or eliminate the criticized aspects. Western civilization now lives in peace with non-Western civilization at Columbia College's Core courses. Before we go into our pithy guide to the Core curriculum, there are two very important rules you should remember: 1. How interestirg or how easy/difficult a course is depends a lot on the instructor. Instructors range from tenured professors to fuzzy-cheeked grad students, and teaching and grading styles vary from section to section. 2. Don't forget rule number one. Now, on with our explanations of those vague names of classes you all have to section for. Humanities CI001: Otherwise known as Lit-Hum, many first-year students take this course during their first year because rumor has it that it's easier than Contemporary Civilization (see CI002). But like most Core courses, the level of difficulty varies and depends a lot on the instructor (see rules 1 and 2). If you take Lit-Hum during your first year, one of your first assignments will be to wadethrough Homer's Iliad. No small feat. Most often heard Lit-Hum statement: Where can I buy Cliffs Notes around here? Humanities CIOO2. Known as Contemporary Civilization, or CC (not to be confused with Columbia College, or CC), this course surveys the history and development of European philosophy, otherwise known as the dead white male stuff. Although the books at times seem dull and indecipherable, they do often promote lively and interesting discussions at coffee parties. Honest. Most often heard CC statement: I read MOST of it. Humanities 1121. A.k.a. Art-Hum, the course spans the history of Western art from the earliest Greek works to contemporary Spanish art. Much of the class time is spent looking at slides of famous works and discussing them, and the general consensus among Art-Hum veterans is that it is a fairly interesting and fun course because you can sound erudite from finding the meaning of a huge blue spot worth millions in a museum. But remember, it all depends on your instructor (once again, rules 1 and 2). Most often heard Art-Hum statement: Well, I think it represents... Humanities 1123. Otherwise know as Music Hum, the course is a lot like Art-Hum, but instead of peering at slides of famous art, you'll be listening to tapes of classical Western music. Many students also enjoy this often relaxed course and some instructors incoporate the classical works of Elvis Presley into the music list, but remember... Well, there you go. These four courses are the backbone or ""core"" of the Core. Though you'll have several other curriculum requirements in addition to these (yes, several), none will be shared by as many students at one time. Consider it a bonding experience and always keep your chin up, chest out, and enter your first Core curriculum classroom knowing you are continuing an old tradition.U» M.n.ori.l Library, m ce-tr,. ad minlsl r.

158,CC deals with largest class in history,6 September 1991,"By Danny Franklin Spectator Staff WriterThe largest first-year class in Columbia College history arrived this week, bringing with them not only their luggage but several administrative problems. Approximately 870 students are registered in the class of 1995, about 70 students more than the average class, according to Columbia College Director of Admissions Lawrence Momo.Columbia College admitted more students this year, expecting about 25 additional students to accept so the school could use the extra tuition money to alleviate a financial aid deficit accumulated the past few years. The percentage of students who accepted invitations increased about 2 percent, Momo said. ""The margin may seem small, but it can cause a big overage,"" Momo said. Momo credited the studentrecruiting staff with the increased percentage saying they made ""all the difference in the world."" The most pressing problem the large class presented was the need for additional housing, according to Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka. ' 'It could have been a real disaster,"" Lehecka said. The administration, however, avoided difficulties because a smaller percentage of students requested housing and because there is a smaller first-year class in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Director of Residence Halls Harris Schwartz said. ""All in all it managed to work out in the same spirit as the Giants able to kick a field goal in the last five seconds... agreat deal of luck,"" Schwartz said.University Residential Housing also sets aside an extra number of first year rooms in case of extra students. The new students did not exceed that number of rooms, Schwartz said. In addition to housing, room for the extra students had to be made within the Core Curriculum classes, Lehecka said. According to Lehecka, one extra section was added in both Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities. The English Department also added a few extra Logic and Rhetoric Classes. ""It isn't a one year problem with the Core Curriculum. It goes on for two years with CC and Lit Hum,"" Lehecka said. The extra sections will have to be maintained for two years in Contemporary Civilization and Literary Humanities, while the extra Logic and Rhetoric sections will only have to be maintained through the end of this year. The extra tuition money will go to pay for the extra sections and for financial aid for some of the new students. Further money will go to the financial aid office to alleviate a deficit accumulated in the past few years, according to Lehecka. Lehecka said the additional students' tuition provided the school with needed, though unexpected, funds. ' 'We have instructions from the University that there is to be no deficit [in Columbia College] this year,"" Lehecka said. ""We have to get that to zero,"" he said. ""This is one of the ways to make that possible."" As a result of the large first-year class, Lehecka said the admissions office must be careful with admissions for the class of 1996. ""We must assume a high yield. We can't afford another mistake like this,"" he said."
159,Core should encompass global issues,24 September 1991,"By Mitchell M. WongPerhaps the greatest accomplishment of Columbia University is the formation of the Core Curriculum, which offers a strong and fundamental understanding of Western philosophy and thought. For over half a century, it has been the paragon of social education and the envy of countless institutions of higher learning. However, the value of the Core simply cannot be measured by comparison to other syllabi, but by its utility in the real world. Under such scrutiny, it seems that the Core is rapidly becoming more and more archaic in the ace-deration of the fast paced world we live in today. The Core Curriculum was created in response to World War I in 1919 with the birth of the Contemporary Civilization syllabus. The goal of the course was to educate students in recognizing (and, if possible, nullifying) the causes of dissension and violent resolution. This was to be accomplished by requiring students to read pieces of literature which influenced the development of current society. Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities were added to the Core in 1937 to supplement Contemporary Civilizationthrough studies of the creative spirit in Western culture. Since then, the Core has not been significantly modified. However, the world has changed dramatically over those 54 years. The 1990s preside oVer a world of incalculable speed and never-ending change. The emergence of a global economy and unhindered communication has shattered the supposedly impenetrable and eternal geographical barriers which, until now, have sheltered the complacent solitude of the United States. The West is no longer the sole cause of international events. The worldwide concern over the Gulf War clearly demonstrates this point. As for the Core's present usefulness, did it offer any insight into the delicate policies and decisions made by Iraq, Israel, the Middle Eastern countries, and the rest of the world during the Gulf War? Could the attitudes of the Chinese communist hardliners who crushed and hunted the Tienanmen Square protesters be discerned using the Core as a guide? How much of the Core could be applied to examining the mutation of democracy into a bloody series of slaughters by Monrovian leaders? When these questions are asked, it seems that although the Core offers an advantageous overview of Western culture, if provides, at best, a myopic understanding of African, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern cultures. The extended Core is incapable of covering such cultures with the same depth the Core covers Western civilization. With such a deficiency, how can the Core successfully fulfill its goal of unearth-ing the multicultural roots of modern day society for inspection? It is time for the Core to be rewritten with a global consideration in mind. Significant texts and works of art from non-Western cultures should be completely integrated into the Core and not taught separately as an addendum Extended Core. This should be done even if Core courses have to be expanded into additional terms or hours. The priceless advantage of having such different works taught side byside is that it allows a student to develop a deeper appreciation of the intricate similarities, differences, and parallels between familiar Western culture and the less familiar nonWestern cultures. In lieu of the greater time commitment generated, the Extended Core requirement and the language requirement could be dropped since the former would already be introduced into the Core and the latter is simply a less efficient way of imparting an understanding of a foreign culture.Another arrangement may be to abridge the current Core by replacing works which address only one viewpoint with those that cover multiple topics or by condensing studies under a general category using only specific passages of texts or just fewer pieces of music or art. For example, Hrosvit's plays could be replaced by Tales of the Arabian Nights, which is (more enjoyably) told from the viewpoint of a woman and a non-Western culture. Monastic music need not be repeated ad nauseam whenjust an example or two of early Western music could be used in its place. The valuable time spent on repetition could be better used for a broader range of study. It is only after we have been rearmed in our knowledge of the ways of the world that we can safely assume our capacity to disempower those who would bring about conflict through unfamiliarity, misunderstanding, and trust.Mitchell M. Wong is a Columbia College sophomore."
160,CC still trying to restore fellowships,3 October 1991,"By David ShayneDespite a seven-month search, Columbia administrators have been unable to find money to restore the Chamberlain fellowships for graduate students teaching Core Curriculum courses. The Chamberlain Fellowship, an incentive for graduate students and assistant professors to teach Core Curriculum courses for six semesters, was discontinued last spring for graduate students because of lack of funding. Core Curriculum coursesinclude Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. The fellowship, originally slated to be discontinued in spring 1989, was extended for an additional year with funding from a one-time donation from Columbia College Dean Jack Greenberg's office, according to Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis. The fellowship will not be reinstated next semester, but the option to restore it remains if funding becomes available, Yatrakis said. ""It would depend on the budget for next year,"" she said. Eliminating the fellowship was a mistake because the quality of the Core Curriculum is an integral part of the Columbia education, according to Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History J.W. Smit, who is head of Contemporary Civilization department. "" I felt it was a bad example to cut the central piece of the Columbia College education,"" Smit said. ""I felt the savings should have been made elsewhere."" Smit, who resigned from his position as chair of the Contemporary Civilization department after the fellowship was canceled, said he agreed to return to his post in July because Greenberg promised to raise funds for the fellowship. Greenberg's promise, however, does not guarantee that funds will be raised, Smit said. ""Obviously, he cannot promise me that at a certain point we willhave the money,"" he said. The fellowship for assistant professors remained even though it was canceled for graduate students. Smit said the cancellation of the fellowship for graduate students showed that ""preceptors do not have the clout of other groups."" When the cancellation was announced last spring, several preceptors said the cuts were unexpected and unfair. ""Because Dean Greenberg had restored the money temporarily, some of the preceptors felt the fellowship would continue,"" Smit said. Some of the first-year preceptors said they had not expected to receive the Chamberlin Fellowship. ' 'When I interviewed last spring,they didn't mention it to me,"" said Laura Gaughran, a preceptor for Contemporary Civilization. ' 'When I entered the program, it was completely moot. I didn't even feel like they were taking it away from me."" ""No one said anything to me [about the fellowship],"" said Preceptor John Ransom. ""No one has even asked me if I'm stickingaround next year."" If the Chamberlain fellowship is restored, Smit said he would like it to become a postdoctoral award to encourage graduate students who have completed their dissertations to teach for an additional year, Smit said. While in the past, departments granted graduate students annual one-year fel-lowships, some departments are now offering five-year fellowships, Smit said. The five-year fellowships will encourage graduate students to teach Core Curriculum courses for their final two years, Smit said, while completing their dissertations in seven years. Smit said he thinks students should beencouraged to teach for a third year after receiving their doctorate. ' 'When they teach for only two years, there is too much coming and going in the department,"" he said.Jacob Smit"
161,"Registering patterns: long lines, aggravation, the works",1 September 1992,"By Elizabeth Berke Spectator Staff WriterSo, you think you've had horrible experiences? Nightmarish days? Terrible weeks? I would venture a rather substantial wager that nothing in your past experience will compare with the upcoming weeks of registra-tion. Every year, the administration comes up with a plan to improve the process. This year, the lines will be shorter, and everything will be organized, and everyone will know exactly where to go, when, and why. They say that every year. Maybe this year they'll be right. The basic process is that you have to sign up forcer-tain classes such as Physical Education, Logic and Rhetoric, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Contemporary Civilization (those in the core curriculum) before you actually register. This process of choosing core curriculum classes is called automated sectioning, and from there it moves on. Registration takes place after classes have begun, enabling students to explore a variety of classes and make an informed decision before they go through the computerized administrative process that commits them to a defined schedule. Those in the know would advise students to get to the lines early in the morning and toward the beginning of the designated time slot in order to avoid the long lines of the last minute rush. Students who are confused about the registration process should turn to their student advisers, who will give them detailed information about how to make sense of the pencil book, the course guide, and the registration process. In addition to students advisers, faculty advisers can be very helpful for students as they choose their course of study. Also, these professorial advisors will provide the needed signature of approval on their registration forms after students have decided upon classes and the double-checked the schedule to make sure there are no time conflicts. From there, only lines await those brave enough to have made it this far. While it may be frustrating and time-consuming and stressful, it is not impossible, and those going through registration for the first time should remember that everyone else has had to go through it at least once before. And you have it easy now. Registration used to be held in the Old Gym, not the Lion's Den of Ferris Booth Hall. Imagine finding the Old Gym during your first week on campus. For one thing, it's underground, and for another thing, there's also a Levien Gym inside the Dodge Physical Fitness Center. And, there's no sign saying ""Old Gym"" on the front of the doors leading to the Old Gym. See, it could be worse. But it'll get better. After automated sectioning, classes start. And then registration, then midterms, then Winter Break, then summer. See it's not that bad. And the best part is, you only have to do it eight times. Good luck."
162,Get to the core of Columbia,1 September 1992,"By Elliot Regenstein Spectator Designated FlunkyColumbia's Core Curriculum is famous or infamous, depending on who you ask. But it all depends on how you approach it. Treat it well and it will give you a lifetime of pleasure, but treat it poorly and it will kick your butt. There are a few basic facts about life in the Core Curriculum which are absolutely essential; —If your teacher is great, your class will be great; if your teacher stinks, you're in trouble. The curriculum is very strong, but a lame instructor is certainly capable of ruining it. Most instructors are very good, and there are ways to get out of bad situations. With Contemporary Civilization (CC) and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), which are full-year classes, your best bet is to suffer one semester and create a time conflict for the second semester. With Art Humanities (Art Hum) or Music Humanities (Music Hum), which are one semester apiece, you may have to drop the class and start again later. One campus celebrity is rumored to have dropped Music Hum after one week every semester he's been here. —It will be much better for your sanity if you don'tstart comparing your workload to that of your friends in other sections. Some instructors believe that reading 400 pages of deep philosophy every night is the only way to truly experience college; with others, reading the back cover is basically enough. Unless your teacher is an unfair jerk, don't think about it; this is college, and you're supposed to do a lot of work. —Speaking of which, it's really a good idea to do your reading. The books are fantastic, and you can really get a lot out of these classes if you try. Often it's possible to slide by without working too hard. But you'll feel cheated afterwards. Hate to sound like your mom, but it's really true. Obviously, if it's a Friday night and you're choosing between the Village and Voltaire, you'd be a fool to stay cooped up in your room; but if it's Tuesday night and the only thing on TV is ""Ishtar,"" for crying out loud, do your work! Anyway, now that I've completely alienated all of you, here's a quick look at what the Core Curriculum entails: CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION is the heart and soul of the Core. CC dates back to 1919, and incorporates the work of almost every noteworthy dead white male philosopher. In many ways, it'sthe hardest Core class; many elect to take CC sophomore year following Lit Hum, while others dive right into it (and a lunatic few take both at the same time). The typical CC experience will be something like this: you'll do a whopping amount of reading, go to class, discuss the reading with 15 to 20 worn-out classmates who also did the same whopping reading, and then you'll go home to do another whopping reading assignment. There are variations on this theme. For one thing, virtually every section will have: a) someone who always does the reading but never says anything, b) someone who never does the reading but still always has something to say, and c) people who never do the reading and never say anything either. LITERATURE HUMANITIES dates back to 1937, and is patterned after CC, except that instead of philosophy, you'll be reading great works of literature. This makes it somewhat easier than CC, just because the reading is a bit easier (in two years, you'll feel no shame about saying, ""Yeah, I thought Goethe was a good read, but Kant just put me to sleep.""). The major book the two classes have in commonis Plato's ""Republic,"" which is definitely worth reading twice. ART HUMANITIES and MUSIC HUMANITIES are only one semester, but are similar in style; a small class, working its way through the white male history of some cultural genre (art for ArtHum and music for Music Hum, for those of you who weren't paying attention). I say white male history because traditionally, nonwhite males have been poorly represented in the Core. In an attempt to remedy the situation, Columbia has created the Cultures and Issues requirement (formerly known as the Extended Core or Major Cultures requirement). Unfortunately, there's really no way you can learnan appreciation of every culture in four short years; as it is, you barely come to an appreciation of dead white male culture, and that's only one small piece of the puzzle. Those who end up majoring in something like sociology, anthropology, history, or other related areas have a much better chance of taking more than the required number of classes in non-DWM cultures. Those in the hard sciences will probably fulfill their Cultures and Issues requirement, and that will be it. Speaking of science, there is a science requirement, as well as a language requirement, and a PE requirement. How you fulfill these will be up to your personal taste, and you can use any number of criteria to choose how you go about it.For instance, I knew someone who took Italian for his language requirement, simply because it was the only Latin-based language for which the introductory class didn't meet on Fridays. The language requirement, unlike virtually everything else at Columbia, can be placed out of. Those are your basic requirements right there. Obviously, you should read the Bulletin pretty carefully; if you're the kind of person who'd read this far in an article like this, you probably would have done that anyway. The key to your Core Curriculum is, be ready for a lot of work, do that work, and appreciate it. And if you find that the Core Curriculum is not for you, the information number for Brown University is (401) 863-1000."

164,Cliff contemplating Homer: O bitter irony,17 September 1992,"By Tim CarvellA wright freshmen. First-years. Sorry. Listen up. Odds on, you're facing a year of Literature Humanities. You just graduated from high school. You're not ready for this. That's why I'm here. I'm Cliff. As in Cliffs Notes. I'm here to help. I'm here to make the year easier. I've read the books, and I've got advice to spare. You wanna' pass Lit Hum? Start taking notes. THE ILIAD: Okay. You've got your Spartans. You've got your Trojans. Yes, Trojans. The Spartans are fighting the Trojans. Somebody wins. In-class comments: ""Homer's conception of war seems very different from our own."" ""Pericles seems to have a little too much id for his own good."" ""I find this passage ironic."" THE ODYSSEY: The original road trip epic. Sort of like ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" but different. Odysseus has to get home to save his wife from suitors. Blinds an ogre (good scene). Kills lots of people. In-class comments: ""Isn't the sex-role interplay fascinating?"". ""It's all about guest-friendship."" ""This passage is quite ironic."" OEDIPUS REX: In a plot as far-fetched as the Warren Commission Report, a son marries his mother, then dashes his eyeballsout. In-Class Comments: ""Woody Allen would love this."" ""Wow. This guy must have read a lot of Freud."" ""Doesn't this play have a lot of irony?"" MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYS: Good news. This one is so dull, nobody reads it, not even the instructor. Simply fake your way through discussion, safe in the assurance that everybody else is doing the same. THE AENEID: The same basic plot as the Iliad, but longer. In-class comments: ""Virgil's conception of war seems very different from our own."" ""Aeneas has too much ego for his own good."" ""Irony, irony, irony."" THE REPUBLIC: Everything you ever wanted to know about the theory of forms (but were afraid to ask). Just keep mentioning the cave analogy, and you'll do just fine. FAUST: Striving. THE ORESTEIA: A tragedy about whiny Greeks, half of whom die. Sadly, the other half live. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE: Rent the movie. TO THE LIGHTHOUSE: They never get there. Although I've included some discussion statements, there areTim Carvell is a Columbia College sophomore.some instances where your professor will call on you to answer specific questions. In those cases, you have several options: A) Answer yes. B) Ask, ""what do you think?"". C) Kill your professor. By the way, just because you haven't read the books, doesn't mean you get out of buying them. The best way to bluff your way through class is to have a copy of the discussion book in your hand. The easiest way to get that book in your hand is to borrow it from your roommate. If, however, your roommate is of the ""Single White Female"" variety (or if she has read this column) you will want to investigate the possibility of used books, oftenavailable through frilly signs on campus. Failing that, take a class in advanced mime and pretend to have a book in your hand during class until everybody believes you. So, now that we've got the books and in-class discussions down, it's time to write your first paper. Pick any two of the above texts and contrast them. This can be difficult if you haven't read them, because professors like to see some direct textual references. The best way to produce direct textual references is by opening a book at random, slapping your thumb down on the page and using whatever appears as your reference. To make it look really official, list a line number, too. SAMPLE:When Virgil writes, ""fears; I tell you, this,"" (1,461) he is clearly showing an ironic negated antithesis to Homer's counter-argument, ""means, who wandered far"" (1,1). Okay, we're doing well. Now, it's time to take your exams. The best exam policy is to develop illegible handwriting. Most instructors will give up after a page or two of chicken scratch and assign a B+. If you can't muster up a reasonable chicken scratch, the second-best exam policy is to throw your blue book into the air and bolt from the exam room, shrieking madly, thereby invalidating your test results. There. I think that's just about it. I've just passed Lit Hum for you. You're welcome."
165,Lecture series on Core Curriculum to begin tonight,30 September 1992,"By Leyla Kokmen Spectator Staff WriterAs part of an effort to broaden interpretations within Columbia College's Core Curriculum, a new lecture series featuring discussions on selected works from Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization will begin tonight. The series, entitled ""More on the Core,"" is a product of last spring's discussions among members of the Civility Committee's Subcommittee on Gender Issues. ""[The goal is] to foster varied interpretations of these basic texts,"" said Professor of Sociology Priscilla Ferguson, who chairs the subcommittee. The lectures will chronologically follow the Contemporary Civiliza-tion and Literary Humanities syllabi. Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy Arther Danto will deliver the first lecture, on Plato's Republic, tonight at 6 p.m. in Altschul auditorium. The program, although not mandatory, will introduce alarge lecture format to the core, which should provide an interesting accompaniment to small class sections and personal student interaction with professors, according to Morris and Alma Schapiro Professor of History Caroline Bynum. The series is directed not only at students, but also graduate student preceptors who may be teaching core courses for the first time, Ferguson said. The six-part lecture series, whichwill be given by well-known members of the Columbia community throughout the year, begins with Plato and will end next semester with Sigmund Freud. Other topics to be discussed include: the New Testament and early Christian tradition (Oct. 28), St. Thomas Aquinas and Dante (Nov. 18), the Enlightenment from John Locke to Mary Wollstonecraft, and Shakespeare's King Lear. The Enlightenment, Shakespeare, and Freud lectures will be scheduled for the spring semester. Other scheduled speakers include: Union Theological Seminary Professor Vincent Wimbush, Professor of History Martha Howell, Professor of English and Comparative Literature Jean Howard, and George Delacorte Professor of En-glish and Comparative Literature Steven Marcus. The subcommittee reviewed the results of the Civility Committee's survey, which found that many students, particularly women and minority students, are dissatisfied with the core, according to Bynum, who is also a member of the subcomittee. ""It came out of the gender subcommittee of the Civility Committee, where there was much discussion of various dissatisfaction in the core, both in staffing and in content,"" she said. The results of the survey, which revealed students' opinions on race, gender, and other issues, were released in the spring semester. The lecture series presents a more innovative way of solvingdeflcienicies in the core, without making simple changes in curriculum, Bynum said. ""We didn't feel that the solutions to the problem were just adding some new texts or adding some more texts,"" she said. ""I don't think the reason for discontent is really the works that are assigned,"" she added. In addition to the Civility Committee's Subcommittee on Gender Issues, other committees on campus are working toward the renovation of the core curriculum, Bynumsaid. A subcommittee of the Arts and Sciences Executive Committee and the standing committee on the core program are also analyzing the core. ""This is part of a wide effort on the part of a lot of faculty and students on what in the core needs to be changed and what needs to valued and saved,"" she said. Bynum, who will lecture on St. Thomas Aquinas and Dante, said the lectures should facilitate a new outlook on ways to read texts in core courses. ""I'm going to try to bring toDante and Aquinas, two very old and classic texts, questions about what it is to be a human being,"" she said, adding that insights on these works can also fit today's discussions of multiculturalism and personhood. The lectures may help these teachers gain new perspectives on works that are not within their ranges of expertise. ""This is expanding the horizons of the core curriculum,"" she said. 'It's not just for students of CC and Lit Hum. It's for others who have been around CC and Lit Hum, and that's a lot of people on this campus."""
166,"$100,000 of Core grant to pay for capital needs",9 November 1992,"By Brett Cohen Contributing WriterThe first $ 100.000 of a $500,000 grant which was given to Columbia College earlier this semester to strengthen the Core Curriculum will be used primarily for capital expenditures. The committee met Nov. 6 to clarify the allocation plans for the Fairchild Foundation grant. University Provost Jonathan Cole applied for the grant when the University did not have sufficient funds for Core Curriculum necessities such as compact disc stations for the Music Humanities department, andprojectors for the Art Humanities department. In the future, committee members plan to shift spending towards curriculum development, but will spend most of the first $100,000 on capital needs such as photocopiers, computers, books, and video tapes. The committee plans to spread expenditures from the three-year grant over five years. Curriculum development will become more of a priority after capital necessities are met, according to Associate Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures Haruo Shirane, who chairs the committee.""We anticipate more curriculum development in the sccond and third year,"" he said. Columbia College Coordinator Eileen Gillooly, a committee member, said she brought her home computer into the Contemporary Civilization/Literature Humanities office because the department needed a computer. Other professors described similar situations in which their departments could not afford computer printers or photocopying machines. ""To be very frank, the grant was absolutely essential for the continuation and maintenance of a high quality core,"" Shiranc said. Because the subject matter of the core courses falls under more than one department, funds for the entire program arc difficult to find.""In a time of financial difficulty, interdepartmental programs lose out,"" Shirane said. Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature James Mirollo, director of the Literature Humanities program and a committee member, said the grant was greatly needed to keep the core in existence. ""'Without this kind of regular infusion of resources, it's difficult to keep the core going. This is what keeps the core alive, instead of it be ing cither starved to death or stagnant."" The future curriculum expenditures. although not finalized, will pay for teacher training, and training for graduate students who intend to teach core courses, Shirane said.Columbia College seniors converged on the steps yesterday afternoon for the annual yearbook portrait."
167,Academics: Sovern's delicate balance,17 November 1992,"By Leyla Kokmen Spectator Staff WriterThe President of the United States has the luxury of being able to raise taxes. But a university president does not have that power. Raising tuition alone cannot generate enough money to run a college or university. Since the president's success or failure in fundraising can dictate the amount of resources an institution has to develop academic programming,he or she must decide how much ti me to spend trying to bring in money versus how much time to spend directly setting priorities on the university's academic agenda. Having established 12 years ago his goals for raising funds both to create new programs and to bolster existing ones, Michacl Sovern succeeded in bringing substantial grants which supported his academic agenda.Among his achievements within the Arts and Sciences construct, made up of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the School of International and Public Affairs, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and School of the Arts, Sovern has secured donations within the past 10 years to support international programs. A $10 million gift from W. Averell Harriman in Octobcr 1982 revived Soviet studies at Columbia, and created the Institute for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union that bore Harriman's name. The gift expanded the University's Russian Institute, which was established in 1946 as the nation's first interdisciplinary center for the study of Russian and Soviet issues. Last year, the name was officially shortened to the Harriman Institute in light of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Anothergrant,received in May 1991 .helped Sovern achieve his proclaimed goal of making Columbia the world's most international University. The $17.5 million donation from the Italian government created the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America. The money is paying for renovations of Casa Italiana, and creating new professorships and academic programs.In addition to supporting the study of international affairs, Sovern's fundraising efforts also encouraged the diversification of the student body. At the end of the 1986-87 academic year, John Kluge, CC '37, donated $25 million to create minority scholarships at Columbia College, a move which was to help increase minority recruitment. The gift, the largest ever received by the University, created an endowment to fund the John W. Kluge Presidential Scholarship program, awarding 60 scholarships to minority students each year. Sovern said his role in the receipt of such grants for student scholarships, as well as Columbia College's major move to become a coeducational institution in 1983, contributed to the student body's current level of diversity. ""It does matter to me, and I take pride in the fact that we are the most diverse college in the United States,"" Sovern said. In September 1990, Kluge donated another $25 million, this time for faculty recruitment. Twelve million dollarscreated the University's Minority Faculty Recruitment Program, a program which began in 1989 to provide incentives for hiring black, Hispanic, and Native American faculty members. The gift symbolically kicked off the University's current five-year $1.15 billion capital campaign. The drive began with a nucleus fund of $329 million, and is well on the way to meeting the goal. Dedication to Columbia College At the August 1990 celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Aspen Institute, an institution whose program of study of classical works was roughly based on the Core Curriculum, Sovern spoke on the fundamental reasoning behind the Core. ""Freedom, sacrifice, autonomy, service, justice, equality, democracy —these are not new ideas; they arc the passionate concerns of great books through the ages,"" he said. ""Great books are not value-free. Indeed, the original purpose of the founders of Columbia's Core Curriculum was to instill an understanding of the importance to civilization of the cause for which Americans were fighting in the First World War."" Sovern, who graduated from Columbia College in 1953, has shown a deep dedication to the educational tenets of the school. In an effort to create an environment which fosters intellectual growth, Sovem added numerous facets to the traditions of Columbia College. Columbia College's move to bolster its offerings in non-traditional science classes which emphasize a thematic understanding of scientific thought fulfillsone of the goals Sovern had when he ascended to the presidency. Director of the Literature Humanities Program James Mirollo described Sovern's role in creating three teaching chairs, specifically marked for teaching the Core. The chairs, among 10 endowed professorships created in November 1990 from $22 million in donations, showed Sovern's respect for teaching and a University-wide attitude toward the importance of teaching. Mirollo is Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature. Associate Professor of Pediatrics Jennifer Bell, who served on the presidential search committee that chose Sovern and also serves on the one to find his successor, said the number of academic and named professorships has grown in the past 12 years. Mirollo said Sovern has always supported the Core Curriculum, but concrete evidence of that support arose only within the last year. ""I think it's fair to say that he's had a soft spot in his heart for the Core even though he's been distracted by other things, as is inevitable,"" Mirollo said. He said Sovern only moved to financially support the Core after Mirollo and other heads of the Core program approached him, explaining that the Core was becoming ineffective because of a lack of funds. A $500,000 grant from the Sherman Fairchild Foundation re-ceived this semester will support the program. ""Last year, I appealed to him personally and he and [University] Provost [Jonathan] Cole came up with the Fairchild grant,"" Mirollo said. ""But that was in response to an appeal that came out of desperation, that the whole thing was being starved completely."" Balancing finances with academic vision While Sovern's fundraising achievements benefited academic programs, some members of the Columbia community said he spent too much time fundraising, andnot enough time personally spearheading academic improvement. Sovern delegated much responsibility for academic policymaking to the University provost and individual deans, decen-tralizing the process. The University's current structure prevents the chief executive from becoming directly involved in specific academic issues, but allows indirectcontributions through fundraising, according to James F. Bender Professor of Psychology Donald Hood. George Delacorte Professor of English and Comparative Literature Steven Marcus said Sovern entrusted his staff with implementing his goals for academic improvement. Sovern also said he counted on others to implement his plans and work to achieve his goals. ""He wanted a general improvement which he was willing to delegate to his provost and vice president and deans of the schools,"" Marcus said. ""President Sovern's main goal was to continue to dig Columbia out financially."" Bell said members of the Columbia community had expected Sovern to be a strong academic leader. ""He was somebody who came from the faculty, was very involved in the faculty,"" she said. ""He was the provost. There was no reason to think that he was not going to be an academic leader.""As his presidential career progressed, however, Sovern became more and more distanced from the University community, assigning in-creased authority to the provost on academic matters and faculty interaction. Bell continued. Cole became the most visible figure in the administration's handling of academic issues, while Sovern spent time on other projects. This shift of authority has made Cole the focus of more attention in recentyears, while fundraising became more necessary for Sovern than people had predicted, she said. ""I think President Sovern has been an academic spokesman, but I don't think he's been an academic leader on campus,"" she said. ""I think if he had been a total academic leader, then he would have been leading a bankrupt community."" Members of the Columbia community said Sovern appointed strong deans. ""I think it has been more of a dean-driven University rather than a president-driven University,"" she said. Vice President for Arts and Sciences Martin Meisel said a university president's administrative job is to act like a midwife, facilitating good ideas, bringing the practical and the ideal together. ""You don't have to originate the good ideas to make them happen,"" he said. Faculty relations become tense in 1991-92 Opinions vary on Sovern's academic leadership in recentyears. Several administrators and faculty members said Sovern could"
168,Core should not be restructured,25 November 1992,"To the Editor: In the Nov. 19 issue of the Spectator, Rodney Crump writes that black students should ""overreact"" against classes which contain the writings of such white thinkers as ""Nietzsche, Darwin, and Marx"" in their syllabi. Mr. Crump argues that Columbia professors have rejected ""the cornerstone contributions Africa made to civilization"" in favor of studies of these and other white philosophers. Unfortunately, Mr. Crump doesn't realize that studies in Core classes should not be chosen in a manner that is politically correct in any way. Nietzsche, Darwin, Marx, and other intellectuals are studied in classes like Contemporary Civilization because their writings are some of the most brilliant, revolutionary, and fascinating discoveries and ideas ever put down on paper. They are not being studied because they are white. They are being studied because their work is seminal in the course of civilization. And the civilizations that their ideas have influenced are worldwide;these authors have not just been limited to influencing white European society. For example, Marxism has influenced political leaders in countries such as Russia, China, Africa, and Latin America, while Darwinism is the foundation of the modern evolutionary theory that we know today. Nobody can say truthfully that these innovative thinkers had no impact on worldwide civilization. What Mr. Crump implies is that the entire Core Curriculum should be restructured in order to contain studies of important African works of literature. But once education becomes politically oriented, then its value becomes diluted. Should Columbia students not study Wagner in Music Humanities classes because he was one of the most vicious anti-Semites who ever existed? Or should the study of Shakespeare in Literature Humanities be disregarded because the title character of the play Othello, who is a black Moor, is a tragic figure, and commits murder? Mr. Crump's objective does not seem to be to enrich history, but to cover up its brilliant edges with appeasement. He seeks to overlook art in favor of a political ideology whose only purpose is to encourage diversity in the curriculum, without encouraging innovation. Great works of art stand on their own individually, and are universally great at the same time. That Mr. Crump is offended because black authors are not represented as much in Core Curriculum studies as white authors is a naive and insensitive notion, for the form and content are what matter in art, not superficial politics. We cannot afford to reject the great works of Western Civilization, because if the fate of our liberal arts education is for our books to be burned like the books burned by the ignorant in Nazi Germany, then our fate is to be ignorant, too.

169,New Core Curriculm directors favor change Grieve first woman to direct Core program,5 February 1993,"Grieve first woman to direct Core programBy Saara Bickley Spectator Staff WriterBringing a new era to Columbia College's Core Curriculum programs, Professor of History Richard Billows and Associate Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Patricia Grieve will direct the Contemporary Civilization and the Literature Humanities curriculums, respectively, beginning next semester. Both professors said they will work to reevaluate the structures of these Core Curriculum classes. Because both Billows and Grieves were very active in teaching courses in the Core Curriculum and are both from the newer generation of professors, they were primary candidates for the positions, according to Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis. Grieve is the first woman director of a Core Curriculum program. Billows will succeed Professor of History J. W. Smit, who has servedas director of the Contemporary Civilization program for fouryears, looks forward to future changes in the curriculum. ""I was asked to do it, and I have been heavily involved with CC. It seemed like it was worth doing. It's a very interesting time to be in charge of CC and in general to try to revitalize the Core at a time when it is coming under such criticism, some of it justified and some of it not,"" he said. A faculty committee will look at the content of Contemporary Civilization this semester. Although the project is in its initial stages, plans are underway to make the course more closely linked to the issues which have shaped political and philosophical thought, rather than focusing chronologically on selected texts. Contemporary Civilization was originally intended to be an issues class, but during the 19605, thecourse became more concerned with the great books of Western civilization. ""We want to focus more on the key issues that have defined the social and political philosophy of Western civilization,"" Billows said. Faculty who teach Contemporary Civilization reexamine the syllabus for the class every two or three years. The course has come under recent criticism, primarily because of its lack of multiculturalism, but the new structuring will not focus on bringing other cultures and writers outside of western civilization into the class. ""In CC we will not bring in more multiculturalism, but we may work on the problems of ethnic identity and race in Western civilization,"" Smit said. As director of the Contemporary Civilization program, Billows will assume the training of new professors and deal with the budget of the entire Core Curriculum. Grieve, who has taught a Literature Humanities section for four years, said her selection as director of a Core program, is an important step for Columbia College. ""Symbolically, itisagreat step forward. By having awoman, it calls to students' attentions thatColumbiaCollege is an educational institution for both men and women,"" she said. Grieve said she believes there will be a serious reevaluation of the Literature Humanities curriculum in the future because of the controversy over the Contemporary Civilization courses. Grieve replaces Professorof English and Comparative Literature James Mirollo, who has been the administrator of the program for seven years. ""Now I'm looking forward to teaching it without worrying if the bookstore got enough copies of Apuleius. I am actually delighted to pass the torch onto her and the younger generation,"" he said."
170,Conserving the Core,8 February 1993,"Columbia College has announced the names of the two new directors of the Contemporary Civilization (CC) and Literature Humanities programs, Professor of History Richard Billows and Associate Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Patricia Grieve, respectively. We salute Columbia for selecting the first woman ever to head a Core program, and hope that this furthers its modern-day applicability. Billows has indicated an interest in re-evaluating the Core so that it reflects key issues affecting today's society. This is an admirable goal, but it could defeat the primary purpose of the program, which is to educate Columbia College students about the philosophical and literary works that have shaped Western society. If works must be added to the curriculum, it should be because of their intrinsic value, not because of a need to include unrepresented segments of society. Discussions of the issues of race, ethnicity, and gender could be based in the current CC curriculum, without necessarily adding works by female and minority writers, based solely on the authorship. To expand the scope of the Core would be to change and weaken its pupose. In making changes, Professors Billows and Grieve should consider the traditional purpose of the Core, not the traditional shortcomings of society. Rather than standardizing the material covered in class and on exams, CC and Lit Hum professors must have the freedom to discuss the texts as they please, subject to regular departmental reviews. Recognizing that CC is an issueoriented, and not text-based, class, individual professors should selectively assign the text portions most relevant to class discussions. As CC continually adapts itself to modern-day issues, Lit Hum should push toward a primarily text-based discussion of its syllabus. The course is intended to introduce students to the fundamental literary works of Western society; classes should be taught accordingly. All professors and graduate students teaching the course should be required to attend weekly departmental Lit Hum seminars, which are now optional, so that they can learn from one another and mutually select the themes to discuss. As the crux of a Columbia undergraduate education, the Core courses must continue to serve their function, as drafted during the first half of this century: to reflect the achievements and advances, as well as the flaws, of Western civilization."
171,"SPECTRUM Remembering Columbia, circa 1938",22 March 1993,"Remembering Columbia, circa 1938By C. Lowell HarrissCollege Walk was a public street when I began teaching at Columbia College in 1938. Security, day and night, was never a concern. Saturday classes were common. A good lunch at the Faculty Club cost 75 cents and a man's haircut 50 cents. In social sciences and the humanities, nine or 10 hours teaching a week was the rule. The subway cost five cents. Saturday afternoons in the au-the Christmas tree and at Commencement. In the sophomore year every student took, I believe, six field trips in and around New York City, chosen from a large listand integrated, more or less, into Contemporary Civilization. The area between today's College Walk and Butler Library was a non-grass playing field, almost always in use when weather permitted, chiefly for touch football and softball. A few members of the faculty joined in the play.tumn at Baker Field were a pleasure. Freshmen all took CCA and Humanities A (now Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities) and three other courses. The top students were as good as the best anytime, anywhere. But we had more than a few who would not meet today's admission requirements. It would be presumptuous to compare students, then with their counterparts today. You have equipment for study and recreation that put you in a world very different from theirs. .The vast expansion of knowledge has enlarged opportunity beyond measure. How do financial pressures compare? The dollar magnitudesyou face larexceed those of 1938 (adjusting for general inflation), but the Great Depression was still pervasive. The early New Deal recovery turned into a deep, deeply discouraging, reversal in 1938, and the outlook was poor. Nicholas Murray Butler was President. Frequently around 9 a.m. one would sec him walking up the steps of Low Library. He spoke with beautiful fluency at the lighting ofCollege enrollment has doubled since 1938, and administrative staff has grown at a far higher rate. I cannot presume to compare the services to students today with those of 1938.1 do remember well the dean standing behind his desk with the door open, facing the Hamilton Hall entrance, at various hours during the week. Anyone was welcome. My interest in public affairs brought me into contact with students with similar interests. The most articulate were left-wing. A few were very ""left,"" and their words, printed and spoken, got public attention and were, I fear, widely assumed to represent the whole Columbia community. I enjoyed matching wits, but often haddifficulty avoiding the loss of patience. In 1993 we know far more about the evils of dictatorships than one could 55 years ago. There was then not only toleration of Communism but articulate support. Some on Morningside favored Franco over his opposition (which we now know to have been directed from Moscow). Mussolini's Italy undoubt-edly had supporters, but I remember no campus defense. There was certainly no good word for Hitler, but Stalin and Communism had their advocates. And Marxists, occasionally with missionary zeal, appeared frequently. A college group today would include what was missing then: persons who could and would speak intelligently for freedom, including the economics of free markets. World War II was approaching. What were opinions on the campus? My memory is not reliable enough to warrant generalization about the relative importance of various sets of opinions. But after Hitler and Stalin made their pact in August 1939, the ""left-wingers"" repeatedly and vociferously opposed aid to Britain. Somewhere among my unorganized papers I have many of the handbills of that era. Their message, I believe, was not that Hitler deserved support but that Britain did not. Classes had ended when the Nazis attacked the Soviets in June 1941. But we saw an immediate about-face here, as everywhere the Communists tried (and tried relentlessly) to influence opinion. I recall no polls of student attitudes about the war in Europe, but views probably ranged widely until Pearl Harbor. From my first days at Columbia as a graduate student in 1935,1 felt that there should somehow be more contact between students and teaching staff. 1 wondered in 1938 and later why students so rarely accepted my open invitation to meet in office hours to get acquainted—as distinguished from meetings to deal with specific problems. But if there is one thing that has remained the same at Columbia, it is the school's fine students and faculty, persons with whom it has always been a privilege to associate.Stalin and Communism had their advocates. And Marxists, occasionally with missionary zeal, appeared frequently. A college group today would include what was missing then: persons who could and would speak intelligently for freeedom, including the freedom of market economies.C.

172,Core emphasis questioned by committee,23 March 1993,"By Saara Bickley Spectator Staff WriterFollowing an evaluation of the relationship between decreasing instructional resources and increasing curricular demands on the Arts and Sciences constructs subcommittee of the Executive Committee of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has issued a report stating that the emphasis on the Core Curriculum impinges upon the quality of education for Columbia College upperclass students. ""We feel we have problems where juniors and seniors are involved. There are not enough small classes and senior seminars. As students reach maturity in [Columbia] College and as they need to get close to faculty, they are not getting that,"" said Professor Katherine Newman, co-chair of the Subcommittee on Curriculum and Instructional Resources. In recent years the shrinking faculty size has exacerbated this problem, according to Newman. The fac-ulty is currently undergoing a threeyear reduction period in which the number of full-time faculty will be reduced to 476, the level it was at in 1978, in order to meet budget restraints. ""We don't have enough people to continue what we have been doing, especially in the junior and senior years,"" Newman said. The Subcommittee on Curriculum and Instructional Resources report issued in February, which considers the use of instructional resources in terms of the Core Curriculum, states there is an ""inverse relationship"" between the Core Curriculum and offerings within majors. ""Many departments worry that their course offerings for majors are diminished, both in number and in quality, by the demands of the Core,"" the report states. In addition, courses which fulfill the Cultures and Issues requirement have become increasingly difficult to teach because of the academic diversity of the students within the classes. Because many students are unfamiliar with the subjects taught in these classes, teachers are forced to be abstract and theoretical. ""In the effort to ensure the Core people didn't think about how it will affect majors. I don't think we anticipated the sense that there was unanimity among departments that majors are not as strong as possible, partly due to the emphasis on the Core,"" said Professor Lisa Anderson, who co-chairs the subcommittee. Anderson also suggested that University graduate schools alsodraw the attention of faculty away from courses that fulfill requirements for majors. ""The Core and the graduate schools have a call on the department. What is sometimes neglected is the department itself,"" she said. Anderson said that in a survey of departmentchairs, conducted by the subcommittee, professors said increases in the number of faculty would help to alleviate the problem. The subcommittee's report also addresses graduate students who teach Core Curriculum classes. Ideally, Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities courses would be staffed equally by senior faculty, junior faculty, and graduate students, according to the report. Graduate student proctors, however, have been over-represented in the past and they currently teach over one-half of the Contemporary Civilization sections, according to Columbia College Associate Dean Kathryn Yatrakis. The report suggests that the recentdecrease in the number of graduate students at Columbia will be detrimental to the Core Curriculum. Not only will there be fewer instructors, but because students will be discouraged to teach more than two years, there will be greater turnover and additional faculty instructors may be required. In the past five years, the student population of the Graduate School for the Arts and Sciences decreased by 10 percent, according to Dean of the Graduate School Roger Bagnall. Bagnall, however, said he does not think the decrease will have ' negative effects on the Core Curriculum or individual departments.He asserted thatthe quality of teaching will improve and that faculty will have more time to devote to other areas. ""The decrease in the number of students means the number of dissertations will decrease. As there are fewer of them professors will have more time,"" he said. Bagnail also said there may be some realignment in courses as graduate student faculty recognize there are too many small graduate classes. While the majority of the departments surveyed by the subcommittee criticized the Core Curriculum for its rigorous time demands, the report states that there is ""virtually universal"" support for some type of core curriculum at Columbia College. ""There is across the board support for the Core, but also a widespread feeling of rethinking the format of the Core,"" Anderson said. One suggestion offered was to combine larger lecture classes with smallerdiscussionsandtogetgreater faculty input in the content of the Core Curriculum, Anderson said. ""We think we are doing an excellent job in some areas and not as excellent in others. We need to work through the problems,"" she said. The Strategic Planning Commission's task force on education and the Committee on the Core are currently discussing possible reforms to the Core Curriculum. The Executive Committee of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Steering Committee of the Chairs created the subcommittee last semester to determine how to most effectively use the resources of the Arts and Sciences."
173,Lit Hum section forms not to list professor's names,26 March 1993,"By Saara Bickley Spectator Staff WriterIn an attempt to reduce administrative confusion and long sectioning lines, the Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI) voted on Wednesday to not include the names of professors teaching Literature Humanities classes on sectioning forms next fall. Because professor names will not appear on sectioning forms, students will choose sections solely on the basis of time preferences, and be required to remain in their assigned section unless a time conflict ensues. COI members based their decision on a desire to reduce the administrative tasks involved in sectioning for Literature Humanitiesclasses. It will be tried on an experimental basis for one semester. ""We were asked to consider it and the staff seems to favor it. As there seemed no compelling academic reason not to do this, theadministrative benefits were persuasive,"" said Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis, who chairs the COI. Two-thirds of the professors in the 1 iterature humanities department favored the elimination of professor names from sectioning forms, according to a department poll taken this week. ""Most people bel ieve that choice would be the optimum, but not choice that leads to chaos. I think the experience this year was extremely chaotic,"" said Professor of Religion Peter Awn, who teaches Literature Humanities. The change will greatly reduce problems that occur from the sectioning process, according to Eileen Gillooly, the administrative director of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""Between two to eight hundred students try to make changes in their schedule each semester. There are 52 sections of the same course and there are 1,000 students. We can't give everyone what they want,"" she said. Sectioning problems were greater this semester than in the past,Gillooly said. ""Lit-Hum and CC completely crumbled this semester. I had onehalf of the faculty complaining they had no idea who was in their classes,"" she said. Students regularly waited up to three hours in lines to change their class sections and the registrar had difficulty accommodating all student requests this semester, according to Gillooly. Many students, however, said they doubt the new policy will reduce registration lines. ""I can't imagine the lines getting any shorter. Something always goes wrong,"" said Cindy Zee, CC '95. Professor James Mirollo, director of the Literature Humanities program, said the change will make the choosing process more equitable. ""You go for people you know, but only 22 students can have class 'X'. It is very unfair to students who don' t get what they want and to new teachers who are well trained,"" he said. Many students disagreed with Mirollo's assessment. ""We pay $20,000 a year. We should be able to decide what professors we get. We are even the ones who stand in line to change our programs,"" said Sandy Mechael, SEAS '95. ""Although you shouldn't pick someone by name, you should be able to choose. That is what education is about,"" said Avi Orlow, CC '96. Mirollo did admit he believes students determined to choose their own professors will find ways around the system. ""In my admiration for Columbia College students, I believe they will find out anyway,"" he said. If the elimination of professor names does not solve the problems it is intended to, the names of professors may be included in sectioning forms for the 1994 spring semester, according to Yatrakis. Professors were not 1 isted on sectioning forms 10 years ago, but because the system caused complaints among students and faculty, professors were again listed. ""We always go through these periods. I find this part of the grand cycle of Columbia politics,"" Awn said."
174,There is no logic to L&R,26 March 1993,"By Jeremy SenderowiczDear Dr. Rupp:When you become president of Columbia, you will have to deal with many high-profile problems, all demanding solutions. I realize that most of your time and effort will be spent dealing with such pressing problems as fund-raising, deteriorating race relations, faculty morale, and especially revision of the Core Curriculum. It is this last point to which I wish to turn your attention. I would like to discuss a staple of the Core that is usually left out of the omnipresent, impassioned debatesabout curriculum revision, but is just as important as the courses that provoke all the arguments. I am talking about Logic and Rhetoric. I can tell you. Dr. Rupp, that most students view this coursewith emotions ranging from apathetic resignation to bitter hatred. In part, this is the inevitable result of people reacting to the experience of having to write high-quality essays for the first time. Writing is hard, and writing well is harder. People who did not learn to write well in high school will obviously have difficulty adjusting to Logic and Rhetoric. Yet this adjustment is made rougher by the actual course. The main focus of Logic and Rhetoric is to get the student to write clearly, to use the right words to express exactly what is meant. In theory, this is a laudable aim, but it is often counterproductive in prac-tice. Most instructors feel it is their responsibility to run a ""search-and-destroy"" mission for all signs of inexactitude. This sounds good, but it often turns into a witch-hunt, a determined effort to ignore the plain meaning of what is written and create doubt where none exists. This leads to ""corrections"" that often are breathtaking in their audacious misreading of the student's work. All this is only applicable to the better writers; the students who really need to learn how to write supply enough mistakes of their own. Yet the students with lesser ability suffer as well from this attitude. ________ This is because thestress throughout the class is on producing technically perfect writing, and the best and hardest part of writing—that of expressing ideas — gets short shrift. Good writing is expressing many ideas in few words,and the quest for ""exactness"" inevitably elbows this concept into oblivion. The focus of Logic and Rhetoric is on teaching writing as a process. This is not wrong, but something equally important has been forgotten: writing is also an art. This attitude manifests itself most clearly in the much-maligned grading system in Logic and Rhetoric. There are many instructors who, quite honestly, feel it is their responsibility as teachers to not give good grades. Because of this, they willseize on any mistake, real or imagined, and ignore the overall clarity and ideas of a paper. Concentrating on the trees, they miss the forest. The results are nothing short of catastrophic. Lesser writers learn quickly that writing is just another process, with rules that must be followed. This is not totally wrong—writing does have its basic rules—but writing is not ""just another process."" If students believe that it is, then the creative spark that suffuses the writing process is suffocated. This leads to writing being treated as work done by rote. Since writing is so inherently difficult, students with such an attitude will inevitably avoid writing like a hot potato after the course is completed. Students with outstanding writing ability feel stifled by instructors who are hung up on trivialities. The message sent out to everyone is ""Why take chances? If you are daring you'll only be penalized."" No message is more destructive to good writing than this one. It may seem that I have been unduly harsh on Logic and Rhetoric instructors, but this is not my intention..There are many instructors who do not act in the manner I have described. I certainly do not wish to give the impression that I am writing this out of disgruntlement with my teacher, for nothing could be further from the truth. In reality the problem does not mainly lie with instructors. The problem is the structural concept behind the course, which necessarily influences all instructors (though some are influenced much more than others). I have some suggestions for possible consideration. 1) Change the main focus of the course from a ""process-oriented"" view to an ""ideaoriented"" one. If proper communication of ideas is stressed, the explanation of such concepts —the ""process""—will thus inherently be dealt with, but in a way that helps the all-important creative spark develop into a flame, not in a way that extinguishes it. The best way to accomplish this is by assigning thoughtprovoking, original essay topics. Many instructors (including mine) already understand this. Unfortunately, many others do not. 2) Focus more on individual styles, because different people have different ways of thinking and communicating. One way to achieve this change could be by mandating more individual conferences with the instructor. This would enable teachers to get more of a feel for students' individual styles, which could reduce misunderstanding when the instructor marks essays. 3) Bring in some real professors. Many instructors have no love for this course, and are teaching it only because they have to for their doctorate. These people do not have the emotional commitment necessary to inspire students with a love for writing. Why not use a combination of professors and grad students? It works fine for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, both of which have as many, if not more, students taking the classes. A teaching requirement may well be necessary, but steps must be taken to ensure that people do not teach this class unless they are qualified and motivated to teach writing, a subject unlike any other. Dr. Rupp, I am sure that as an educator, you know how important it is to stoke a fire of interest in students. Nowhere is this more true than in the case of writing. Perversely, Logic and Rhetoric has precisely the opposite effect on too many people. This is an area that desperately cries out for reform, and it is also an area in which you can have a definite influence. Although you will undoubtedly be forced to spend most of your time with higherprofile issues, this area, though less publicized, is no less important. Please do something about it. Sincerely, Jeremy Senderowicz"
175,What a headache,29 March 1993,"As an experiment for one semester, the Columbia College Committee on Instruction (COI) decided last week not to print in next fall's pencil book the names of instructors teaching Literature Humanities. Three reasons were cited for this change, which has been tried in the past with little success: It would reduce administrative paperwork, shorten lines at sectioning by allowing schedule changes only in the event of a time conflict, and satisfy the demands of Lit Hum instructors. Rather than addressing the heart of the problem, the changes merely sidestep it. Would the new system really reduce paperwork? On the contrary, it seems that students unhappy with instructors they did not choose would scramble to create time conflicts, making add-drop lines even longer and increasing bureaucratic confusion. The source of this problem, the flawed registration system, should be repaired instead of making Columbia students suffer. Professors who support the experimental system may want organized classes as quickly as possible, but limiting students' academic freedom for the purpose of solving administrative headaches is fundamentally wrong, and stands in opposition to the academic ideals of the University. Also suspect is the COl's failure to include the improvement and strengthening of the Core Curriculum as reasons for the change. Witholding the names of instructors will only address the administrative problems of the Core, not its academic flaws. ""Two to eight hundred students"" feel compelled to adjust their schedules each semester, according to Eileen Gillooly, the administrative director of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. A primary cause for this situation is the disparities in the teaching methods and abilities of instructors —a problem which occurs in Contemporary Civilization, as well, although this course will not be subject to the same treatment, oddly enough. The differences create sections which are in high demand and others which repel students. Professor James Mirollo, the current director of the Literature Humanities program, and his successor, Associate Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Patricia Grieve, must work to ensure that all sections are taught well. While the textual nuances emphasized in each section need not be exactly the same, the quality of instruction must be uniformly excellent, so that students randomly placed in sections can be assured that they will receive equally strong educations. It is possible, however, that the random mix of students and opinions caused by the experimental changes could provide a positive result by enlivening discussions.The onus is now on the program's directors and instructors to demonstrate a rapid, tangible improvement in the Lit Hum program, or to discontinue a sytem which appears to be intensely disliked by students less than a week after its creation."
176,Committee can't ignore profs,2 April 1993,"By James V. MirolloSince the appearance of your article, ""Core emphasis questioned by committee,"" [Spectator, Mar. 23] I have been approached by some students and several faculty expressing concern over its contents. On the assumption that other readers of the article may share these concerns, I write to set forth my understanding of existing protocols for revising either the content or the format of Core courses. I must admit to being at something of a disadvantage, however, for although I chair Literature Humanities and the Committee on the Core, as well as the Sub-Com-mittee on Curriculum and Teaching of the Committee on the Future of Columbia College, and the Committee on Teaching, and am a member of the Marcus Task Force SubCommittee dealing with the same issues, I have never seen the report referred to in the article. What is more, no member of the sub-com-mittee issuing the report has ever consulted with me or the committees mentioned above. Of the cochairs you mention, I have never met Professor Anderson, and the only conversation I have had with Professor Newman was a brief telephone call in which she thanked me for my vocal support of the Arts and Sciences Faculty initiatives—but that was last year, when I still believed, against my best instincts, that the Sixth Faculty was maybe after all a good idea. It is at least absurd, therefore, to state as your article does that either the Task Force or Core Committee is currently discussing ""possible reforms"" of the Core Curriculum such as going to a lecture-section format. To put it mildly, there has obviously been a failure of communication, if not of collegial consultation somewhere.Such being the case, I can only resort to legalities. The foundation documents of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the assurances provided by the Trustees in their authorization of the Faculty, make clear that Columbia College's curriculum is in the hands of its Faculty (why else would it need to exist?), which means that any changes in the teaching format of the Core must be proposed to that Faculty by its standing committees (especially the Committees on Instruction and the Core). The Executive Committee of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences can and should, in pursuit of its mandate, investigate any Arts and Sciences activity. And it is also free, along with the Steering Committee of the Chairs, to appoint a sub-committee to send out questionnaires, gather data and opinions, and issue reports. But when the faculty actually teaching and administering the Core are not consulted, the ""report"" thus issued is bound to be less than fully informative as well as being less than authoritative, and certainly not likely to command assent. This is especially true in that only one member of the current Executive Committee of the Faculty has ever taught or administered a Core course, none is a locally or nationally recognized authority on curricular matters, and none, to my knowledge, has addressed a national audience or published anything on curriculum, all of which I either am or have done. Since I have, with regret, invoked my own claims to being consulted,and lest it be thought I am merely piqued at being an ignored resource, I want to assure your readers that I speak for the equally knowledgeable and experienced members of my committees and for many other disillusioned Columbia College faculty. Were it not that we do not wish to present Presidentelect Rupp with a first-class constitutional crisis, we would seriously reconsider our decision to support a Sixth Faculty. I personally have not ruled out, as soon as I find out how to do so, resigning from that Faculty. Let me conclude with two professions of faith. First, the content of Core courses should be determined by those who teach them. They should welcome and seriously consider any suggestions coming from anywhere, but the final decision rests with them. I bel ieve that all 52 members of the Lit Hum staff are in complete agreement with me on thismatter. Second, any change in the format of Core courses, such as going to a lecturesection format, must be carefully studied by the appropriate Columbia College committees with an eye to asking such questions as whether or not, in fact, it would relieve staffing shortages, or whether it would, as Dean Bagnall implies, simply allow some faculty to teach more (and smaller) graduate seminars. How does one adjudicate the needs of juniors and seniors for small classes vis a vis the needs of beginning and sophomore students? Should we not take into account the views of alumni, recent ones especially, on the educational value of the current format? And if the current small-class discussion format is educationally valuable should we not be seeking ways to staff it rather than tailoring the format to available staff? Should a Faculty be helping the central administration accomplish its shrinkage goals or pressuring it to find the re-sources to support a crucial educational goal? Has any member of the AndersonNewman sub-committee inquired into the nitty gritty of room capacity, staffing impact on departments, the relationship of format changes to the size of Columbia College, and to the impending removal of a mandatory retirement rule? I have thought about these problems in connection with my own department's staffing and I conclude that shifting to a lecture-section format would seriously hamper its need to fulfill various graduate and undergraduate obligations. Other departments may face similar problems that are not now perceived. In sum, changing format, far more than changing content, is far too important and complex to be even discussed without the participation of all of us, which means both collegial consultation and the observance of existing authority and responsibility. And we are all listed in the Columbia phone book.James Mirollo is the chair of Literature Humanities and acting chair of the Committee on the Core."
177,SPECTRUM A tribute to one of CU's great profs,6 April 1993,"A tribute to one of CU's great profsDavid SherwoodFor this week, just an anecdote: a story about a man who, in many respects, is the living answer to the age-old question of the meaning ofOne to Grow Onlife. So sit back and read. Sit back and believe. But most importantly, try to understand just a fragment ofthelifeofanextraordinary human being. I had a nickname for him—l called him God, because that was the only name that seemed to fit. Actually, I did at one point call him William Gris, but that's another story. He was old, yet there was something incredibly young about him. But it wasn't his eyes, it was this all-knowing smirk that he wore continuously on his face. It was an expression that said, ""I have lived."" I hope that one day, I too can say that. Literature Humanitieswas supposed to have been about the great works of Western civilization. It ended up being about one great man. I remember once, I was away for the weekend, and my bus had arrived late. I didn't want to miss his class, so I raced in, sweating, with three bags hanging from my shoulders. The whole class sort of laughed at me, for caring so much about one lousy class. But he gazed at me with his smirk, and motioned for me to sit down, as if to say, as he often repeated, ""the right thing, at the right time, for the right reasons."" I sat. The works might have been great on their own. Yet he created masterpieces. I have already forgotten about many of the works. But his wordswill never leave me. How can you forget that which has permanently changed you? His words are a part of who I am. He spoke of the deep sorrow of losing his cousin, Tennessee Williams. He told of the afternoons he had spent befriending a lonely and homesick woman named Flannery O'Connor. And then, there were the war stories. He described how a captain forced him to choose between two of his military patches, one of a marksman, the other of a medic. If you go to his basic trainingcamp, somewhere, you will find a ripped marksman patch lying on the ground. They do not mix, he said. One time, in a moment of confession, he told us the worst thing he had ever done. When he was a medic on a Navy ship, he had replaced the anesthetic with water before an operation. The operation, a circumcision, was to be performed on a hated crew member. He said the cries were haunting, while at the same time satisfying. It's the one thing he wished he could do over. I'm still not sure if that means he wishes he hadn't done it, or if he wishes he could do it again. I don't think it matters. The enigma is the most important part, for as he says, we are neither angels not beasts. There are three true commandments, and seven""do-the-best-that-you-cans."" He's the most real person I've ever known. When I remarked once that I thought modern art stank, he replied that it wasn't the art, but rather the public that stank. He chuckled abouta time when he typed up a little note in his apartment, and then proceeded on over to the Museum of Modern Art, where he instantly created art out of a regular old drinking fountain. The sign said, ""Drinking Fountain, Wallace Gray."" No one used the drinking fountain; they simply gazed at his wonderful"
178,New phone sectioning to replace current system,16 April 1993,"By Mike Stanton Spectator Staff WriterBeginning next semester, students at Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) will be able to section for limited enrollment classes by using a touch-tone phone to call the University's registration computer. This telephone mechanism will replace the current process of automated sectioning. ""What this means is a radical change,"" University Registrar Joseph Capobianco said. The process will require studentsto enter their Columbia identification number, a special Personal Identification Number, followed by a five-digit number that identifies the specific section the student desires, Assistant Registrar Marguerite Nelson said. ""We'll give the students a worksheet before they leave in May, which will help them organize the information and make the phone call easier,"" Nelson said. ''The computer will let the student know immediately if they have gotten into the section they requested."" The change grew out of the University Senate's decision to changethe academic calendar, starting classes on the Tuesday, rather than the Thursday, following Labor Day. This change went into effect this year for the first time. ""Because the dorms aren'tavailable until the Thursday before Labor Day, itdoesn'tgive us much time to hold automated sectioning and distribute the results before classes start,"" Capobianco said. ""The registrar's office, and the deans of students from the Engineering School and [Columbia] College formed a committee to determine how we make the process better,"" Capobianco added. The committee's original plan called for continuing students to section for their classes in May, but officials were not sure how many places they would need to set aside in the sections for first-year students. ""We had scheduled sectioning for continuing students for this spring, but the registrar's office didn't feel confident enough about keeping spaces open for the incoming students,"" said Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka. ""The ability for students to sit at home and register for classes should represent a significant improvement over the old process of waiting on lines,"" Lehecka said. Sectioning by telephone will take place for the fall semester betweenSept. 3 and 10, and students involved will be assigned an appointment time, before which they may not section. ""Automated Sectioning did have a degree of randomness that we wanted to maintain. The appointments will ensure randomness in the process,"" Nelson said. ""If a student calls before their appointment, the system will shut them out, and not allow them to register until it is their turn."" All Columbia College and SEAS students will receive an abbreviated list of courses for the fall semester before leaving for the summer, Nelson said. ""There are quite a few courses involved, so it probably will make sense to produce an extract of the entire class schedule, so that students can consider theirentire schedule when deciding which limited enrollment sections to apply for,"" Nelson said. The new process, however, will not allow students to choose specific professors for Literature, Art, or Music Humanities courses, Capobianco said. ""We take our direction in those areas from the departments, and the schools involved,"" Capobianco said. The Literature Humanities department decided in March to withhold the names of the instructors assigned to each section, adopting a policy that had been used by the Art and Music Humanities departments since the inception of those courses."
179,Untitled,19 April 1993,"The student co unci! should not issue resolutions which judge a student group for its activities, intentions, or beliefs. Such controversial resolutions contradict the student council's pri-Mary purpose of acting as an impartial representative body which works for the benefit of all Columbia College students. Instead, the student council should focus on the fundamental issues of general student life, more specifically, student services. Career services, dining services, libraries, registration, and many others directly affect the quality of student life for every group and individual. Although these issues are not as controversial, the student council needs to shift its attention to the improvement of these services because they are so basic to our everyday lives.Representative for Community AffairsNo statement available.Representative for Government AffairsI believe that the Columbia College Student Council should have the authority both to condemn and to praise the actions and the speech of those on campus. After all, thestudents of Columbia College vote for representatives to express the views of the student body regarding these controversial issues. Elected members of council should be given enough responsibility to act accordingly when these types of disputes arise. Many of my fellow classmates complain that the council holds no power and exerts that which it does have ineffectively. I believe that this is true and that we ought to elect representatives who will have enough courage to act decisively in matters involving racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, homophobia, and general intolerance. When there is a consensus regarding a particular issue, the Columbia College Student Council should, by all means, represent the sentiment of the student body and exercise the authority that its peers have given it. If this were not the case, there would be little reason to even have a council in the first place.As CCSC stands right now, I feel that it is not justified in judging the actions of any group or individual. Student council's judgments and decisions should represent the general con-sensus of its constituency. Clearly, CCSChas had little success in communicating with CC clubs and students. How can it suppose to represent their opinions? COMMUNICATION! Objective criteria for judgment must also be developed. CCSC must insure itself against the biases of its members. A council of Big-endians may not judge the actions of Little-endians fairly unless restricted by a set of standards. CRITERIA FOR JUDGMENT. If CCSC can accomplish both of these goals, I feel it would be justified in judging the actions of Columbia College organizations and individuals. I hope it would be a last resort, however. If council can communicate with its constituency, then it ought to be able to mediate between groups and avoid crisis. Clearly, the question of judgment becomes much easier with nothing to judge."
180,Report finds average GPA to be 3.34,23 April 1993,"By Saara Bickley Spectator Staff WriterIndicating that Columbia College students' grades have been subject to a trend of inflation, a prelim inary report released this week by a subcommittee of Columbia College's Committee on Instruction (COI) states that the mean grade point average (GPA) is 3.34, or B plus. The report, which was discussed at last week's faculty meeting, concluded that the overall mean GPA was 3.32 for the fall semester and 3.35 for the spring semester. Included in the report was a listing of how frequently students re-ceive specific grades. Columbia College's grade distribution, in descending order of frequency, was as follows: A minus, A, B plus, B, B minus, C plus, C, A plus, C minus, D,and F. Students at the school are approximately five times as likely to receive a grade of A minus or better than C plus or worse. According to the report, grading policies at Columbia College do not conform to traditional standards of grading. ""There is a bias toward higher grades,"" the report states. ""At some time in the history of Columbia —in the 20s or 30s—the premise of grading was that the meanshould be a C,"" said Associate Professor of Anthropology Terrence D'Altroy, who chairs the ad-hoc subcommittee that released the report. The report surveyed the grades for all Columbia College students for the 1991 -92 academic year, and was motivated by a 1979 University Senate resolution calling for the annual calculation of the grade frequency distribution in all schools of the University. ""This all started last year when the faculty was interested in knowing what the patterns of grading are and the effect on students considering coming to Columbia, class choices of the students here, and choices for majors,"" D'Altroy said. The highest GPAs for the year were in the humanities (3.43), followed by the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization classes (3.33), the social sciences (3.32), and the natural sciences (3.33). The differences in grade point average between fall (3.08) and spring (3.23) terms are the most noticeable in the natural sciences, according to the report. This may be due to the decrease in enrollment (24.3 percent) in natural science courses between semesters, according to members of the subcommittee. Professors of natural sciences said there are several reasons why students receive lower grades in their division. ""It's partly a matter of tradition. Examinations are often objective. In the humanities there is more of acontinuum. We're not known for grade inflation, but our students get into medical schools and graduate schools,"" said Chair of the Chemistry Department Richard Bersohn. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it. It's not a conscious effort to give people bad grades. We just draw our median at B minus,"" he added. The report also states that grades increase as students continue at Columbia College. Seniors have theoverall highest grades, followed by juniors, sophomores, and then firstyears. ""We suspect it may have to do with self-selection, as students decide what courses they want to take,"" D'Altroy said. The report suggests several solutions to the grade inflation. ""We recommend that, in addition to the grade a student receives for a course, the mean grade for that course be included on the transcript. We further recommend that an over-all mean GPA be determined for all the courses the student has taken, to permit comparison with the student's individual GPA,"" the report states. McGill University in Montreal, Quebec instituted a similar system for classes with enrollment of over 25 students, D'Altroy said, adding that the implementation of such changes would not be unprecedented. There are also reasons not to alter the current grading system, D'Altroysaid. Altering the system to reflect traditional grading practices or including mean grades on transcripts may lead to greater competition within classes and be disadvantageous to students when applying for jobs or graduate schools. ""We know we are not an island. Our students have to be out there competing with students from other schools,"" said Columbia College Associate Dean Kathryn Yatrakis, who oversees the COI. Harvard University and Prince-ton University currently have grading systems comparable to that of Columbia College. Yatrakis said she is glad the issue of grade inflation had been looked into, but has not come to a conclusion of whether the inflated grades are good or bad. The subcommittee is currently asking for input over the results of the report. Members will continue research into the grading procedures of Columbia College next year.Alex Metzger, CC '94, does his impression of a monarch in Dodge Fitness Center yesterday."
181,"Thanks, Prof.",30 April 1993,"Editor: The Apology Many years later, this class was to remember how a rumor had circulated about how Professor James Mirollo was considering retirement.At that time, we cried, ""Let it not be so!"" We wept by the proverbial fig tree on College Walk. We prostrated ourselves and then planned a blockade on Hamilton Hall. ""We may not be worthy of the Almighty Mirollo in 301,"" we reasoned, ""but we can still prevent his departure."" But as our kidney stones prevented our actions, we grew frustrated. ""What are we to do,"" we questioned, wandering about in our solitude, looking for something or someone to fill our emptiness. ""Where is Mirollo? Why is he leaving us? What have we done?"" We felt like jackasses before he found us, and shaking his head, he concluded: ""I'm not leaving; I'm just not going to be the chairperson next year. But you people still can't write!"" But alas!

182,"Core Curriculum prize awarded to Mirollo, Smit",15 September 1993,"By Mary E. Pflum Associate Features EditorProfessors James Mirollo and J.W. Smit were honored as the recipients of the First Annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum, yesterday in the President's Room of the Faculty House. Smit, who teaches Music Humanities this semester, and has taught Contemporary Civilization in previous years, is also the Queen Wilhelmina professor of German history. Mirollo teaches Literature Humanities and holds the Parr professorship of English and comparative literature.The recognition ceremony was long overdue, according to University Professor Emeritus William deßary, the reception's master of ceremonies. ""You can have great book awards. You can have great teacher awards. Those awards are generally reserved for stars. But someone has to provide leadership for the team. And that's what we're trying to recognize today,"" deßary said. ""It's always a struggle to keep the Core going. The Core only goes on if there are people willing to work at it,""he added. In their acceptance speeches, bothSmit and Mirollo expressed hope that the Core will continue to grow and change in the years to come without losing its unique, personal flavor. ""I feel encouraged that this is an annual award, because that means there's going to be a Core in years to come. The Core will evolve over the years. But there are some things that should remain the same,"" Mirollo said. Mirollo expressed concern that drastic changes in the Core Curriculum's format, most notably an increase in class size, might detract from the goals of the Core Curriculum. Expressing worries about this semester's larger, experimental sections of music humanities courses, Smit said radical change in the Core Curriculum in the form of growing class sizes is cause for alarm. ""There is a tremendous differ-ence between lecturing and having good class discussions. The most important part of [Contemporary Civilization] is that it forces selfcriticism. I think it would destroy not only the CC course, but the Core, to increase class size,"" he said. ""If the Core is made into a series of lectures, it will kill the Core and [Columbia] College will have lost its soul,"" Smit concluded. Mirollo served as dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1970 to 1971. He also chaired the English department from 1971 to 1973. A teacher of Literature Human i ties for the past 26 years, Mirolla also chaired that department from 1982 until last spring. Smit has taught Contemporary Civilization since the 19705. He served as chair of the Contemporary Civilization program from 1978 to 1982 and again from 1989 to 1992.

183,Two Music Hum. sections expanded,16 September 1993,"By Mary E. Pflum Associate Features EditorIn an effort to determine whether the focus and character of the Columbia College Core Curriculum can be maintained in the framework of larger classes, student enrollment in two fall semester sections of Music Humanities has been expanded. According to Associate Professor Elaine Sisman, chair of the Music Humanities Department, two sectionsof Music Humanities, whichmeet at 11 a.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays, have been combined into one section with a limited enrollment of 52 students. Sisman said that another Monday/Wednesday section of the course, which she teaches, has been expanded to allow 35 students in it. Core courses are traditionally limited to a maximum of 25 students, Sisman said. According to Sisman, the experimental expansion of the sections was the result of recommendationssubmitted last year by a Strategic Planning Subcommittee on General and Special Education, chaired by Columbia College Dean Steven Marcus. ""The committee talked to the chairmen of all the Core classes and made various recommendations.They suggested that we experiment with class size,"" she said. ""The expansion has nothing to do with our staff or the size of our department. It has to do with the administration's thoughts of expanding the college in years to come,"" Sisman added. If the University pursues projected plans to expand Columbia College's undergraduate population, currently at approximately 3,200 students, in years to come, Sisman said, experimentation with Core Curriculum class size is a necessity. ""Our experiment is to see if we can maintain the Core format with more students. We just want to see if it can work,"" Sisman said. In an interview last week, Marcus said that he is not yet certain if this experiment will be tried in other Core courses, but that the other Humanities programs are being studied to see if possible changes could be implemented. ""We certainly want Humanities to undergo a very careful review,"" Marcus said. Several advocates of the traditionally small Core classes, however, worry thatenlarged enrollments in Music Humanities and other Core courses will ultimately destroy the intimate atmosphere and discussion opportunities that make the classes unique. According to James Mirollo, Parr professor of English and comparative literature and former chair of the Literature Humanities department, the small size of Core classes is one of Columbia's chief assets. ""The Core evolves. It will evolve. But there are some things that make it what it is—one being small class size. The Core identifies us and weshould try to maintain it in the way we have done,"" Mirollo said. ""You shouldn't fix what ain't broke. If we begin to look like everybody else (with large lecture classes), there's no reason left to come to Columbia,"" he added. Richard Billows, chair of the Contemporary Civilization program, said that a growing undergraduate student population should not necessitate ""oversized"" Core Curriculum classes. ""The whole point of these Core courses is for the students to discuss and interact with each other and the instructor. With a larger section, you're talking about a very different enterprise—a lecture class,"" Billows said. ""If the University continues to increase, one goal would be to have a larger faculty or to integrate the teaching of the Core into the graduate student program,"" he added. Despite faculty complaints regarding the enlargement of the Music Humanities sections, Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis insisted that there is no cause for worry. ""Faculty members experiment all the time with courses. This is nothing new. All we're doing is seeing if the larger sections will work academically and pedagogically. We'll hear from students. We'll hear from faculty members. And we'll carry on from there,"" she said. Students enrolled in the enlarged courses are already collecting ideas to submit to Col umbia College deans when course evaluations are distributed at the end of the semester. Simon Banyai, CC '96, a member of the 35-student Humanities section, said he does not like large classes in principal. ""I'm not in favor of larger courses.I went to a private high school with 15 or 16 students in each class. I think larger classes give the opportunity fpr too many people to hide,"" he said. Although Nicholas Chremos, CC '96, said that he thinks Sisman is doing a ""pretty good"" job handling her class of 35 students, he admitted that he worries about continual expansion of the size of Core classes. ""I think it's all a little silly. If one pays so much money to go here, one expects smaller courses. Essentially, the entire point of the Core ceases to exist with larger classes,"" Chremos said. ""One reason I came here was for smaller courses. Otherwise, I would have gone to the University of Texas —and it's a lot cheaper to go there,"" he said.Three neighborhood children give Facilities Management a hand by using their bubble solution to give the lion heads outside Butler Library a thorough cleaning."
184,SPECTRUM New Lit Hum registration is wrong,20 September 1993,"New Lit Hum registration is wrongBy Jeremy SenderowiczColumbia University is antichoice. Now that I've gotten your attention, let me explain. Columbia is not ""anti-choice"" with respect to abortion, but rather with regard to Core Curriculum classes. Last semester, Columbia decided to stop listing Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) sections by instructors, leaving only time slots. This deprived students of the option of choosing their instructors, for, I believe, no good reason. The administration explained this decision as being necessary for ""relieving student anxiety and bringing order to a chaotic registration procedure,"" [Professor James Mirollo, in a letter to the Apr. 13, 1993 issue of The Federalist Paper]. I am sure that registration is indeed chaotic from the administration's vantage point, and I can definitely testify that student anxiety runs rampant during this period. But is this truly the way to rectify the situation? From the student's point of view, it is obvious that choosing between instructor-blind sections only increases student anxiety, instead of decreasing it. No one feels secure about a crapshoot, and that is exactly what sectioning for Lit Hum has become. This is especially pronounced when one considers who the majority of these students are. Most people in Lit Hum are firstyears, who are nervous enough as is. It is true that most of these students wouldn't have much information on the instructors anyway, but at leastthey have the chance to find out —if they know the names to research! The typical first-year is already cross-ing his or her fingers and hoping for the best section in Logic and Rhetoric, Music Hum, and/or Art Hum. It is bad enough that all these sectionsare anonymous (why, indeed, are they?) but Lit Hum does not need to be added to this list. Aren't thesepoor little first-years scared enough? What makes this all the more galling is that, in all probability, the administration's job will not be made any easier. The computer registration system may efficiently fill out the sections, but what will prevent mass switches once students see who their instructors are? Indeed, when I went to the Lit Hum department last week to change my section, I discovered that several sections that were full when I initially registered were now open —indicating that many people had already switched. Instructor-blind choices only increase the chances of finding the wrong teacher, meaning there will probably be more students who want to switch, not fewer. Even if the number of students who actually can change sections is limited due to the new computer system of registration, this will probably lead torampant student dissatisfaction—if it hasn't already. However, the worst things about this change are the messages sent — to the faculty as well as to students. Why, indeed, have there always been so many students who switch sections? This is mostly due to students who feel they are in a bad situation with their instructors. No doubt a large part of these incidents are the fault of students, but all too often, these situations develop unavoidably. The student and instructor may not jell, or the teacher might simply not be good. Every semester, I'm sure there are cases where much of a particular section wants to switch out for these reasons. In this light, the administration's decision looks less like an action to assuage student nervousness, and more like an attempt to protect the egos of mediocre instructors. If this is true, it is a terribly perniciouspolicy. Instructors who see they are losing their students will inevitably work harder to improve. Without this incentive, many may just remain at their level of mediocrity. Thanks to the new system, students do not even have the option of trying to avoid instructors with this reputation. The advent of instructor-blind Lit Hum registration sends a message to (mostly) first-year students: ""We're more concerned about protecting our mediocrity than with your education."" I sincerely hope that Professor Patricia Grieve and the Lit Hum department recognize this and pull the plug on this experiment after the semester. It would show that Columbia is pro-choice not just in the political realm, but also in ways that concretely affect the lives of students. As the latter is more mundane, it may be harder, but it may also be more rewarding.Jeremy Senderowicz is a junior at Columbia College."
185,New used bookstore replaces NRS,27 September 1993,"By Zach Serber Contributing WriterThe Last Word Used Books store opened Sept. 7 at the site of the former NRS Used Books store, which vacated the location last spring. After falling behind in his rent payments, Paul Solano, the owner of NRS, agreed to vacate the University-owned storefront on 118 th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and University officials began a search for new tenants. The store was closed all summer while the new owners, Karen and Dondi Clark, renovated the interior and restocked. University officials said their search for a new tenant was influenced by a desire to maintain the services the community needed. ""We were definitely looking for the same kind of store,"" said Geoffrey Wiener, associate director of the University's office of planning and development. The Clarks have experience in the Columbia community, after selling books and records in the Morningside Heights area as street vendors for the past five years. Additionally, Karen Clark graduated from Barnard College in 1983.""Columbia was very generous to take a couple of street vendors and give us a store,"" Dondi said. To begin to prepare for the community's demands, the Clarks stocked up on Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization course books, which they said have sold well. ""All the [Richard] Lattimore translations of the Iliad were gone in the first two days,"" Karen Clark said. Neither Columbia administrators nor the Clarks seem particularly worried about the future of the store. Karen said the current poor economy encourages people to look for a bargain, making the market for used books greater than it was in the1980s. Wiener was also optimistic about the store's future. ""The tenants gave us a business plan. They've had experience, and they have financial resources,"" Wiener said. ""Part of it is a judgment call. The new store is much more attractive and inviting."" One of the conditions of the lease was that the Clarks refurbish the store, and Columbia putin a new sprinkler system as a fire-safety measure. The ceiling and the floor tile are new and the pair built the bookshelves in the store themselves. The store had fallen into disrepair during the final year of Solano's occupancy. Although University officials said they attempted to assist Solano, he repeatedly proved unable to makehis rent payments. ""We bent over backwards to give him every chance to turn his store around,"" Wiener said. At the time, Solano said the poor economy and a personal illness hampered his ability to meet payment deadlines. Because of the store's size, only about a third of the stock that the Clarks own is actually on display. They buy most of their books from library sales, though they said they will also buy from individual customers. Karen often runs the store while Dondi drives from sale to sale buying books. ""Running this store is an education,"" Karen said. ""It's a world apart from street vending,"" Dondi added.A passing pedestrian checks out the window display at The Last Word bookstore.

186,SPECTRUM Don't ignore essence of the Core,27 September 1993,"Don't ignore essence of the CoreBy Dr. John D. RosenbergA bland headline in the Sept. 16 Spectator, ""Two music humanities sections expanded,"" portends bad news for Columbia College. At the heart of Columbia College's intellectual distinction is the ongoing experiment we know as the Core. Invoking that same spirit of innovation, the Strategic Planning Subcommittee on General Education recently recommended that we ""experiment"" with the size of Humanities sections—an experiment to be tried in one direction only: greater numbers. Spectator reports that Music Humanities has complied with the recommendation by establishing one section with a ""limited enrollment of 52 students,"" and another limited to 35. Because of the projected increase in the population of the College, the Chair of Music Humanities, Professor Elaine Sisman, seconding the subcommittee's report, argues that""experimenting with Core Curriculum class size is a necessity. Our experiment is to see if we can maintain the Core format with more students."" The answer, for anyone who has ever taken or taught Contemporary Civilization or Humanities, is that you cannot. Humanities sections ""limited"" to 52 students, or to 35 or 350 will inevitably negate, by virtue of their size, the intense, intimate engagement of teacher and student with the book in hand, the classroom dialogue that constitutes the course. ""Faculty members experiment all the time with courses. This is nothing new,"" says Kathryn Yatrakis, a strong supporter of the Core. What Yatrakis says is perfectly true —and perfectly beside the point. For the subcommittee's so-called ""experiment"" is not an experiment at all, if by the term one means a controlled procedure designed to ascertain a new fact or confirm an old one. Rather it is a verbal ploy designed to mask, in hard financial times, the collection of tuition dollars from more students, and the paying out of dollars to fewer faculty. If the administration or the Strategic Planning Subcommittee were more candid, competing claims —the need to increase revenue vs. the desirability of smaller classes —might be intelligently debated and honestly reconciled. But the present ""experi-ment"" is more like shooting a horse in the head to see if it will run faster on fewer oats. It won't, though the cost of provisioning the creature willundoubtedly go down. Some students in the swollen sections will have excellent lecturers and will like the experiment; some will have less gifted lecturers and will not. But the results will in any case be meaningless. For not a single participant in the experiment will in truth have experienced Humanities, though the course will still be so-designated in the Columbia College Bulletin. For a time Columbia College will continue to draw students from all over the nation because of the fame of the Core and our success in promoting it. For a time, alumni will still contribute to the college in the mistaken bel ief that they are perpetuating what they most valued in their four years here. But word will get out, reputation and cheapened reality will pull too far apart, and something unique and irreplaceable will have vanished from the culture of Columbia College. Perhaps, I am too apocalyptic inmy fears, too unwilling to swallow public relations gimmickry in the interests of a larger and, maybe, a less financially pinched Columbia.But my fears are based on almost 40 years of close connection to the Core, first as a student sitting in the classrooms of its founders —Mark Van Doren, Moses Hadas, Lionel Trilling—then as Chairman of Humanities when it threatened to disintegrate under the centrifugal forces unleashed in 1968, and now as the Literature Humanities instructor with perhaps the longest continuing association with the course. Over time, and in consequence of witnessing and encouraging much au//?enncexperimentation, I have come to appreciate the irreducible elements that have enabled Humanities to evolve and adapt while remaining its essential self. These irreducible elements are a common reading list and common final exam for all sections; small classes that encourage discussion, with a maximum of 22-25 students, most of them in their first year; a teaching staff that meets regularly and with full autonomy debates and decides each year's syllabus. Any one of these three elements, if subverted, will render the other two ineffectual. Fifty independent sections of 22-25 students each, with each section reading its own thing,cannot possibly constitute the communal enterprise called Freshman Humanities. Thirty sections of 50 students each cannot possibly experience Humanities, any more than you can silence all the marvelous talk in th Q Symposium and still have a Platonic dialogue. I return to the collapsing of two sections of Music Humanities into one with a""limited enrollment"" of 52, a phrase that puts me in mind of a passage from Thucydides known to generations of Humanities students. Thucydides describes the corruption of language under thestress of war: terrible actions— murder, betrayal of one's family to the state—come to be called courageous or patriotic. Orwell called such mind-warping euphemisms ""Newspeak,"" and now we find a less lethal, laundered specimen cited 'mSpectator. I prefer to call the doubling of class-size exactly what it is, so we can debate it for what it is: a wise orfoolish choice among many hard choices in tight financial times. Let us not, except as a sick joke, call it ""an experiment in format."" I have saved the worst for last. ""It is not yet certain,"" Spectator reports in its most alarming sentence, ""if thisexperiment will be tried in other Core courses..."" 1 suggest that, before the experimentbecomesacertainty, the administration consult with each of the respective teaching staffs and with the Committees on the Core and on Instruction. And in fairness to our alumni, as well as in prudent regard for their future contributions, the administration might also solicit their response to the doubling up of classes in Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Are we indeed so destitute that we are reduced to eating the Core?"
187,"Marcus, Bynum discuss possible Core changes",13 October 1993,"By Brad Meacham Contributing WriterDean of Columbia College Steven Marcus and Dean of the School of General Studies Caroline Bynum spoke about ways to retain the small size of Core Curriculum courses with increasingly scarce resources with about 20 students lastnight in Professor Robert Hymes' apartment in East Campus. Early in the evening, Mark Robilotti, CC '94, asked what future changes are in store for the Core Curriculum. Marcus said the traditionally limited size of Core Curriculum classes is under consideration. ""I find nothing offensive with experimenting with a larger section provided that it features an extremely good instructor. Twenty-one [students] need not be the magic number,"" Marcus said. Currently, there are two sections of Music Humanities which exceed the traditional limit of 25-30 students, one of which includes approximately 65 students.Marcus said that if Columbia is currently faced with ""50 percent crackerjack teachers and 50 percent that we'd rather not talk about"" something must be done to eliminate poor teaching. When Marcus asked those who attended if they agreed with his assessment, no one responded. ""Since there are no takers, I realize there is a problem,"" he said.""We want small courses and a large number of good teachers. But the two don't necessarily go together."" Bynum said the primary reason that the Core Curriculum may be altered is the lack of monetary resources. ""When we focus on Core classes, the upper level classes are a problem,"" she said. ""There are ways to be more efficient with the faculty available so that those resources can be refocused."" ""[Refocusing] is something that hasn't been thought about creatively here,' she said. ""A, we're going to have to have larger classes. And B, we need to find out ways to make those better,"" Bynum said. In discussing possible changes, Marcus also cited the several ""experimental"" sections of Contemporary Civilization which take a new, thematic approach to the same gen-eral material covered by the rest of the course sections. Marcus said instead of dealing with the material in a strictly chronological manner, these alternative sections deal with several broad themes and look at the material within the context of those themes, hopefully helping the course live up to its title as contemporary. Each ""experimental"" section will be evaluated by students and faculty and any changes to the overall Contemporary Civilization program will be decided on sometime next year, Marcus said. Marcus said the Cultures and Issues requirement also needs to be reformed because it currently includes a wide selection of courses from various departments. He spoke of a need to ""redefine the meaning"" of the requirement and establish courses which fit into a discrete series of classes rather than the current ""hodgepodge,"" as well as new Cultures courses which address growing areas such as PanAfrican studies. Another program which will receive attention will be the Logic and Rhetoric course, which Marcus characterized as widely unliked. ""It doesn't bother me that people don't like it, but it is a problem that there seems to be so little retentioneffect,"" he said. As a professor, Marcus noted that students often forgot what they had learned in Logic and Rhetoric by their senior year. What needs to be determined is whether that situation indicates a problem with the course itself or with the amount of writing required elsewhere in Columbia College, he said. Pippa Murray, CC '96, asked whether the practice of witholding a list of instructors' names for Literature Humanities courses, begun this semester, would continue. Marcus said that when he was an undergraduate at Columbia, students also signed up for anonymous sections of the course, but added he was""on the fence"" on the issue. Jay Berman, CC '94, said he is concerned that first-year students may take as many as three Core Curriculum courses during their first semester without knowing the names of their instructors. ""I'm trying to push you off [the fence],"" Berman said. Marcus said one reform may include developing a teacher training center like the Business School uses to insure that all teachers are as good as they need to be. ""If the Core is strong, it's strong enough to be experimented with,"" Marcus said."

189,Students prepare Core petition for Marcus,24 November 1993,"By Nathaniel Daw Spectator Staff WriterIn order to protest several experimental Music Humanities sections, a Columbia College student will present Dean of Columbia College Steven Marcus with a petition tomorrow signed by over 600 students. Rebecca Stanton, CC '94, said she began circulating the petition approximately six weeks ago in one of her classes. Working with her friends, she has since solicited signatures from students in Ferris Booth Hall and in two University dormitories. The petition says students are ""shocked and dismayed"" by two experimental Music Humanities sections thatexceed the traditional class size of approximately 25 students. ""We implore your administration todiscontinue this experiment as soon as possible, and above all not to extend it to other Core Curriculum classes,"" the petition continues. The experimental Music Humanities sections, one of which exceeds 65 students, are two of several Core Curriculum experiments introduced this semester. In addition to the changes in the Music Humanities, six Contemporary Civilization sections are using revised syllabi this year that are organized thematically rather than chronologically. Stanton said her petition is specifically aimed at the Music Humanities courses, not the changes in Contemporary Civilization. ""[The Music Humanities experiment] has the singular advantage of saving money. It's an extraordinarycase because it seems to directly contradict what has been said about the purpose of the Core in the past,"" Stanton said. ""The purpose of the Core is exactly what it says in the Bulletin: that you get to discuss things and actively think about them yourself. We pay $24,000 a year for that privilege, so there just isn't any excuse,"" Stanton said. Marcus said he could not discuss the details of the petition because he has not yet read it, but he said he will take the petition into account when evaluating the experiment at the end of the semester. ""I'm glad that they feel strongly. It's good to know that they care. It's very important that they do,"" Marcus said. He has repeatedly supported the experiments in the past, saying that Music Humanities classes do notinvolve as much class discussion as other classes within the Core. In an interview last month, however, he said that any further experiments with the Core Curriculum will not be implemented without extensive planning. ""The Music Hum classes were done spontaneously with no bad thoughts in mind,"" Marcus said. ""Further experiments will not take place in that way. We want to be thorough and careful about it —after all, it's our college."" Students who signed the petition said they were especially worried that the experiments will lead to enlarged class sizes in Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, two classes which are designed for discussions. ""I think if classes are bigger it's definitely going to detract from the Core. I don't think there's any way that everyone would be able to participate, either speaking or listen-ing,"" Kimberly Chang, CC '95, said. Small class sizes are what make Core Curriculum classes special, according to many of the students who signed the petition. ""You can go read books for any other lecture class and go listen to a professor speak,"" Emily Hu, CC '95, said. Stanton said she had collected 652 signatures by Monday, although she expects to obtain more from petitions posted in four residence halls. Although she has already completed her Core Curriculum requirements, Stanton said she circulated the petition to help maintain the quality of education for future students. But she admits her motives are not completely selfless. ""I don't want my diploma to be devalued after I graduate,"" Stanton said.

190,A call to arms in defense of the Core,20 January 1994,"By JON BONNESpectator reported last year that a subcommittee of the Executive Committee of Arts and Sciences had been reevaluating the Core Curriculum and had tossed around the notion of turning parts of the Core into lecture courses. Then, with the start of the current academic year —and the numerous changes that accompanied it —came another blow to the Core's format: two enormous, 65-student sections of Music Hum. It'was once assumed that the Core's format could never be manipulated in such ways. But teaching resources for the Core have been stretched thin in the past number of years. Graduate students now lead classes once taught by professors, and professors grumble that teaching the Core takes away from their other duties teaching courses within their department or doing research. Thus, some argue that because the Core steals faculty resources, more students should be put with fewer teachers in a different format (a lecture, for instance, with discussion sections run by graduate students). That way, the rest of the faculty could go back to teaching within their department. But it's hard to say that's the right solution. The report of the Committee on the Future of Columbia College, released last May, stated as one of its major recommendations thatthe Core's ""integrity"" was to be maintained —including ""the format, size of classes and discussion technique."" This position is echoed by James V. Mirollo, professor of English and former director of Literature Humanities —one of the staunchest defenders of the Core on campus. ""The content is negotiable,"" he says of the Core, ""but I'll die for the format."" He says that faculty not oriented towards the humanities often show ""a reluctance to be sympathetic to the Core, perhaps because the Core teaching is focused much less on the hard and social sciences than on the humanities."" And he expresses a constant level of frustration in fighting both to keep the Core as is and to serve it well, ""It is hard to have to constantly defend something you believe in and something the College keeps telling the world is what we do."" Lines in this debate are rather fuzzy in the faculty ranks. Mirollo sees a portion of the faculty—mostly those who come to Columbia unfamiliar with the College's traditions of education —as willing to gut the Core, or at least its format. Such faculty, he says, are fighting against what they perceive to be ""nostalgia"" on the part of College-centric faculty. As a result, this latter group is accused of having a ""fortress mentality."" Mirollo sees many of them as proponents of the ""Harvard system,"" tolerant of large lectures by distinguished faculty,a technique he finds unacceptable. ""How do you discuss 'Antigone' in front of 700 people?"" he wonders. Psychology professor Donald Hood frames the debate in a similar manner, though he sees potential for changes in the Core. Hood, a former vice president of Arts and Sciences, acknowledges that many faculty have a certain distaste or the Core. ""How many faculty at Columbia really care about the Core?"" he asks rhetorically. ""Very few."" But this attitude, he says, is caused in part by the Core being kept sacred by a small group of senior faculty very much devoted to Columbia College tradition. Arts and Sciences cannot even bring up the notion of tampering with the Core's format —primarily because the bill of rights drawn up when the Arts and Sciences faculty was created prevents such tampering. Eric Witkin, who served as president of the Alumni Association from 1988 to 1990 and has remained on the association's board of directors since 1974, says,""I think alumni give money to the place because they feel obligated to future generations to guarantee the availability to them of what they felt was most precious about their past experience, namely the Core."" There is another voice to be heard: the students of Columbia College, the ultimate beneficiaries of the Core. Students always bicker about the Core's content —though James Mirollo points out that LitHum has had about 150 different books in its syllabus, hardly a static content for a course. But what many students do not appreciate is the unique format the Core offers. There are few educational experiences like the Core —a chance to approach the defining works of Western culture (or a brief sampling of them) in an open format that promotes debate. It is the Socratic method at work in modern times, allowing for ideas to flow freely, always questioned. The format may not be appreciated by students because it requires such an active role in learning. There is no room in the Core for the inactive mind or the complacent student. And the lecture mentality has sunk into the student body. Mirollo offers a call to arms to the student body to preserve the Core courses. ""They're trying to take them away from you, so you won't have the same gift"" as previous Columbia graduates, he says. ""Don't let them do it!"" The 75 th anniversary of the Core will arrive in 1994, and for those 75 years, Columbia College has offered its undergraduates an experience unparalleled by any other school in the country: a personal, unadorned look at some of the most influential books in our culture in a setdng that allows each student to have intimate contact with the books he or she reads.It can take most of the credit for setting Columbia College apart from any other undergraduate school. It's bound to face some change, but its format must be kept intact. Otherwise, Columbia College will lose a part of its identity as crucial as the past, present, and future graduates who can appreciate what Columbia College alone awarded them: the chance to experience the Core.Jon Bonne is a Columbia College senior."
191,Section change requests down,9 February 1994,"By LAUREN M. ROSENBLUM Spectator Staff WriterIn the midst of ongoing experimentation with the Columbia College's Core Curriculum, the number of section change requests for Literature Humanities has dropped dramatically since last year, when the department decided to omit instructors' names from the schedule of classes. Administrators had decided to stop listing instructors' names in an attempt to reduce the large number of students who requested section changes during the registration period each semester. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations Coordinator Eileen Gillooly estimated that about 100 students petitioned the office for literature humanities section changes this semester, the second consecutive semester when instructors' names were not published. Over 2 50 requested section changes in spring of 1993. Ina Lepkowitz, who works in the Literature Humanities office, said about 90 percent of the 1200 students enrolled in Literature Humanities were satisfied with their sections and did not request section changes.""That should give you some indication of the differences,"" Lipkowitz said. Gillooly said many students in the past petitioned for section changes because they desired certain instructors. ""People think they want a namebrand teacher,"" Gillooly said. ""When people don't know who the professor is, they are more willing to try and they don't have false expectations."" Gillooly said the new system works better for both students and administrators. ""People are more or less happy. It seems to work from my perspective,"" Gillooly said. Lipkowtiz said the office is able to accomodate most, but not all, students who have time conflicts. She added that students whose requests are turned down often react irrationally. ""Some students become very difficult. [The students say] I want somebody from this department, or I want somebody without an accent,"" Lipkowitz said. Lipkowitz said that although students technically should not be aware of instructors teaching specific sections, students do trade thisinformation. ""Other students tell them, and they shop around,"" Lipkowitz said. ""There is a biggrape vine out there."" Richard Kramer, CC'96, said he believes administrators decided to stop listing instructors' names because many students complained of unfair grading policies. ""Last year there were a lot of complaints that the grades are very subjective, but the problem still exists,"" Kramer said. Kramer objected to the administrators' decision to stop printing names of the instructors of specific sections. ""It only treats the symptoms. It doesn't get to the heart of the problem,"" Kramer said. ""It is bureaucracy in action."" Deborah Salzberg, CC '97, admitted she appreciated not having to make a decision about which instructor to choose, but said she would like to be more informed. ""I wouldn't have had any clue who to choose but it would have been nice to know who they [the instructors] were and where their interests lay, so I could see if their interests matched mine,"" Salzberg said."
192,Spectrum In defense of Dean Marcus,15 February 1994,"In defense of Dean MarcusDANNY FRANKLINIn the seven months since Steven Marcus became Dean of Columbia College and the Vice President for Arts and Sciences, he has beencharacterized as ineffectual, incompetent, and the enemy of everything students say they love about Columbia. He has been called things that do not merit being printed on thispage, even though they have been. Whether or not Dean Marcus' first seven months on the job have been successful or not is, in this regard, immaterial. The attacks made on him have been nothing less than scurrilous, and are closer to playground cruelty than informed debate. This is not to say that Marcus' tenure has been altogether successful: by his own admission, it has not. Many of his actions and comments have deserved thoughtful, informed criticism. Unfortunately, this is precisely what they have not received. What is so baffling about the attacks on Marcus is that they are almost entirely baseless. The chorus of his detractors say Marcus will destroy the Core, but can one person pointto a specific proposal of Marcus' that will truly undermine the Core Curriculum? Putting 60 people in a single Music Humanities section was certainly misguided, but Marcus maintained from the beginning that it was a one-semester experiment that would never be applied to Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization. Marcus has said that the Core is being examined and changes are being considered. All across campus, people throw up their arms in disgust and say Marcus is trying to destroywhat is uniquely great about the Columbia education. Since I have been a student here, however, I have heard one horror story after another from students about their experiences with the Core Curriculum: bad teachers, inflexible syllabi, etc. And now, when Marcus says he wants to improve the Core, eyes widen and jaws fall to the floor as if he suggested razing the Parthenon. For all the talk about the great progressive tradition at Columbia, the campus' response to Marcus has shown that this campus is more conservative and averse to change than Oral Roberts' Moral Majority. And so these reactionaries have gleefully begun to number the days until Marcus is forced back into the classroom. Indeed, if student sentiment against the dean does not soften, these people may get their wish. Inevitably, student dissatisfaction will evolve into angry phone calls from alumni. Then, the death knell may indeed ring for Dean Marcus. This would be unfortunate, because over his long career at Columbia, Marcus has shown the capacity for innovative solutions to difficult problems, and a genuine concern for the quality of the Columbia education. His work with the Marcus Commission in particular, is still mentioned by administrators as one of the most important contributions any individual has made to this campus in the past 20 years, and set a standard for strategic planning that has not been approached in the 15 years since the commission's report was filed. Marcus has shown ability in the past, and in the long run, it would be a shame for students to lose his talents from the administration. An early departure is avoidable, but it requires a drastic change in the dean's priorities. The most profound error Marcus has made thus far has been his failure to meet with students on a regular basis. It was predictable given Marcus' dual responsibilities as dean and vice president. The merg-ing of the two positions has been tricky and Marcus said in an interview the other day that the most difficult part of his work to date has been learning to delegate responsibilities so that he could have the time to meet with students. As it stands, the only regular contact Marcus has with students are his evening office hours, but this is not sufficient, and he knows it. It's not enough to allow students to come to you. You must make the effort to go to them. Marcus said that he regrets not having enough time to go to bas-ketball games, and eat lunch with students in Ferris Booth, but the demands of his work, he says, make this impossible. What Marcus needs to learn, however, is that meeting with students is by no means something he should do only when he can find the time. It is perhaps the single most important and constructive responsibility of the dean. Engaging in dialogue with students would give depth to his proposals, and soften resistance to his plans for the college. Meeting with students would be an invaluable investment for the dean, and one that he can and must make in the coming months. In the end, his work load would be lessened because the students, once they are familiar with him and his ideas, would be less intractable and hostile. To make Marcus' tenure as dean successful will require some effort by students as well. We must be willing to listen carefully to what is being said, think before we criticize, and when we do, make certain that our goal in doing so is the improvement of our college. It may seem unsavory to some, but who could argue that it is not worth trying?Danny Franklin, CC '94, is a lame duck Spectator News Editor."
193,Spectrum Popular culture vs. Lit Hum,17 February 1994,"Popular culture vs. Lit HumBENJAMIN STRONGI wish to renounce publicly my support for the Core Curriculum and in particular the Literature Humanities program. This announce-ment may be shocking to those readers who know me, since they are probably aware that it is my career ambition to become a professor of English literature. But I can no longer argue with staunch conviction that reading the seminal works of Western literature illuminates our own humanity, or that these works help each of us to become more complete individuals and better contributors to the society in which we live. I should emphasize that my change of heart is not a newfound allegiance to the sad doctrines of ""pomo's"" like Jacques Derrida or Susan Sontag; I still think post-modern theory is elite-contrived bullshit. The reason I now reject the benefits of Lit Hum is that I now recognize an essential qualifier to the nodon that life imitates art and that therefore we can enlighten ourselves through art. Life does imitate art. Life does not imitate high art —the fictional world of Odysseus, King Lear, and Molly Bloom, the sublime realm in which the maserpieces of Picasso, Mozart, and Plato hover eternally like the latter's perfect forms. Yes, life does imitate art, but life does not imitate good art —life imitates bad art. Remember how more than one American youth was recendy compelled to become roadkill after viewing ""The Program""? The moral lessons of Augustine and Dante could not have possibly helped these misguided teenagers escape the tragic fate which brought them down. But perhaps if these youth had discussed, in intimate seminar-style groups of 15-20 students, the great works of American popular culture, they might have learned that for one to lie in the road waiting for the next Oldsmobile is categorically dumb. I propose that Columbia College administrators begin the process of Core Curriculum reform by abolishing Lit Hum and replacing it with a course which will study the most powerful of art mediums. I propose, of course, a class entitled ""Situation Comedy Humanities."" Oh, sorry, this course will be limited primarily to American works, so we'll have to call it ""Masterpieces of Western Halfhour Network Television Comedy Shows,"" and refer to it colloquially as ""Sit Hum."" Not only do sitcoms teach one how to solve a problem within 30 minutes (or within 90 minutes if thefamily is on vacation in the Grand Canyon or Hawaii), but they teach one how to solve real problems one faces everyday. Few of us ever consider, in a fit of despair, gouging out our own eyes, but we all know that we wished at least once that our parents would die so we could be adopted by Conrad Bain. I had dinner just this Sunday with a friend (a Columbia graduate) who lamented a weekend spent on multiple dates with each of two women. ""I was Vinni Barbarino this weekend,"" he told me. Love triangles? I thought. Tristan ? No, that hasn't been on the Lit Hum syllabus in years! Then it came to me: the episode of ""Family Ties"" in which Alex manages to ask two women to the senior prom. They both discover his deceit and storm off camera furiously, but Daphne Zuniga (as the bespectacled frump who forgives Alex) proves to be the mousy, yet sweet girl whom he would rather date over the blonde bombshell. All we had to do now, I told my friend, was figure out which of the two women was Daphne Zuniga. But we didn't know —we'd never studied this show in college. Again, we turned to our humanities education —the only blueprint wehad been given—for advice. ""Think,"" I asked my friend, ""What would Prospero do?"" ""Use his magic,"" replied my friend. Damn, if only we had studied ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" instead of The Tempest , we might have had a practical example to follow! What good is Shakespeare if he can't help you figure out which prom date to go with? And I'd like to have more than just new Core courses. I'd like to take, for example, a seminar on ""Gilligan's Island."" Having lived in River Hall for three years, I've begun to be baffled by the fact that everyone in the building always wears the same clothes and that it seems that once we all graduate we willprobably never speak to each other again, unless we are reunited for a two-hour special with the Harlem Globetrotters. Perhaps such a course could address my concerns. Yes, it's time we rebel against the useless order of dead white men and replace the Homeric epics with ""What's Happening,"" the Old Testament with ""The Facts of Life,"" and Dostoevsky with ""Three's Company."" If Columbia College Dean Steven Marcus does decide toimplement my proposals, I would like to make two final suggestions. The first sugges- , tion is that what was formerly entitled the Extended Core requirement be enlarged to cover not only ""Cultures and Issues"" but also ""spin-offs."" Imagine an entire semester on the inspirational power of ""All in the Family."" My second and final suggestion is that Marcus retain one work from the Lit Hum syllabus for the new and improved curriculum: Michel de Montaigne's Essays. After all, we all have digestion problems one in a while.The Unbearable Lightness of BenBenjamin Strong, CC '94, is a lame duck Spectator News Editor."
194,USCC calls for a more diverse CORE,2 March 1994,"By MONICA MEHTA Spectator Staff WriterDiscussing the idea that Columbia College's core curriculum excludes non-Western cultures in its reading assignments, a panel ofcampus student leaders addressed about 35 students last night in Ferris Booth Hall (FBH) at a forum sponsored by the United Students of Color Council and the Whitney M. Young Jr. Race and Religious Relations Program. The forum, entitled ""The Core: Campus Leaders Debate Conflicting Perceptions of the Core Curriculum,"" and mediated by USCC Vice Chair Bryonn Bain, CC '95, was held to address the growing concern among students and faculty at Columbia College over the absence of non-European authors, artists, and composers in the four classes comprising the the core curriculum: Contemporary Civilizations, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. Columbia College Student Council (CCSC) President Imara Jones, CC '94, and Dan Morenoff, CC '96, editor of the Opinions secdon ofThe Federalist Paper newspaper, said that the core curriculum's readings should not be drastically altered. Favoring the inclusion of readings from non-Western cultures in the core curriculum, Black Students' Organization (BSO) President Marie Louis, CC '94, Treasurer ofUSCC Omari West, CC'95, and Whitney M. Young Jr. Program Student Coordinator Udit Kondal, CC '94 advocated a change in the curriculum. Former President of the College Democrats Allyson Baker, CC '95, favored a re-examination of the way in which the core is taught, and inclusion of die works of women and texts from other cultures into the curriculum. Panel members who favored reform of the core readings said the curriculum currently centers around Western ideas, and because they do not learn about the literary, artiste, and political traditions of other cultures, students are receiving a limited education. ""The core places the ideas of European thinkers at its center,"" Louis said. ""Everyone else is putin the periphery, as if they had no role in shaping today's society."" Members who disagreed with drastically altering the core's readings said the Western tradition should remain the focus of the core classes because Columbia is an institution which is part of Western culture. Opponents' of the change also emphasized that the core was created to spark critical analysis, not to promote all the ideas in thereadings. ""The core hopes to provide students with an understanding of the dominant Western culture in our society, but we are not attempting to enshrine these authors,"" Morenoff said. Morenoff also said he believed that the core classes should emphasize ideas expressed in the works, rather than their origin. ""The core is not history class,"" Morenoff said. ""We study these people because of their ideas, and ideas have no race."" Louis disagreed, arguing that the core ignores the contributions non-Western thinkers have made to Western thought. ""Why is it that all the people acknowledged to have great ideas in the core come from only one subgroup?"" Louis said. ""The limited foundation the core has attempted to give us is based on a falsification of the facts of history."" Baker and Kondal also disagreed with Morenoff, emphasizing the importance of the origin of ideas. ""I don't think you can understand these great ideas unless you understand their origins and their context,"" Baker said. ""The core curriculum implies that a lot of thought that's worthy of attention started with ancient Greece, and that's Eurocentric,"" Kondal said. ""Many of their ideas were borrowed, if not stolen, from Africa and Asia."" West said the core readings are largely outdated, and limit students' access to new ideas. ""Are we as college students supposed to be constrained to what people in the past think?"" West said. Jones said understanding history was important in understanding the problems in the present. ""You can't understand the present without understanding the past,"" Jones said. ""Ifwe're going to change a patriarchal society, we have to understand patriarchy and the only way we can do that is to study patriarchs."" Other issues brought up in the forum dealt with the absence of works written by and about women and people of different origins in the core classes. BSO Political Chair Sharod Baker, CC '95, thought the forum was productive and informative. ""This made Columbia students look intelligent for once,"" Sharod Baker said. ""In particular, Marie Louis and Imara Jones were very well-versed."" Bain said the forum was only the beginning of the USCC campaign to diversify the core readings, and said a committee will be established to address this issue specifically in the near future."
195,deBary examines multiculturalism EALAC professor returns from leave of absence,23 March 1994,"EALAC professor returns from leave of absenceBy BRAD MEACHAM Contributing WriterFor James Mitchell Mason Professor Emeritus ofEast Asian Studies William deßary, multiculturalism is not just the latest trend. He has been leading the charge for greater cross-cultural understanding for decades. As a member of the Society of Senior Scholars, a program that invites retired professors to teach core courses without financial compensation, deßary currently teaches five Columbia undergraduate and graduate courses. Continuously involved in efforts at Columbia to bridge the gap between cultures, deßary, who graduated from Columbia College in 1941, helped designthe current Asian Humanities curriculum, and continues to coordinate translation projects in order to disseminate the literary record of Asia. Additionally, deßary took a semester leave last fall to travel to Hawaii's East-West Center, a gov-ernment-founded non-profit orga-nization in Honolulu dedicated to exploring international issues focused on the Pacific. While at the center, he conducted research, lectured, and planned a conference for scholars to discuss new ways of implementing multicultural curricula in colleges and universities. In an interview conducted after his return, deßary said the current debate in American universities about multiculturalism has lost its focus and will have little effect unless new approaches are undertaken to help solve the problem. Citing last year's conflict over the ""diversity curriculum"" proposed for New York City public schools, he said the multiculturalism debate is misguided and must have a more global focus in order to succeed. ""The problem with minori-ties in America is nothing compared to the rest of the world ... compared to what's happening in Sarajevo or Bombay,"" deßary said. Current studies of multiculturalism tend to be ""too Balkanized,"" deßary said, because scholars contrast different traditions instead of using an integrated approach. Multiculturalism is viewed as a controversial hotspot, not as a unifying entity, he said. ""You have to look at both commonality and diversity. You can't push one without the other,"" deßary said. ""It doesn't work to emphasize one component over the other any more because of the rapidly changing world that exists today."" ""Whereas generations ago multiculturalism meant comparing traditions of far-off lands, today they are all part of die tapestry of the society that currently exists,"" he added. According to deßary, scholars must adopt a spirit of cooperation instead of approaching diversity issues from the current ""apartheid sense of multiculturalism."" ""We need to get accustomed to thinking in terms of similarity and context,"" he said. deßary said most university scholars are concerned solely with researching their own fields rather than considering the broad implications oftheir work. Because tying different disciplines together is not considered prestigious in academic circles, few attempt that approach, he added. As a solution, he draws on Columbia's Asian Humanities tradition, which dates back to the 19405. The program is intended tocomplement the Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities Core Curriculum courses with a discussion of the major texts and ideas of the Asian tradition. Instead of concentrating solely on the significance of the texts to particular cultures, deßary said he tries to emphasize cohesion among the works to increase student understanding of multicultural issues. deßary cited as an example the Lotus Sutra, a work that originated in India but deeply influenced China, Korea, and Japan with the spread of Buddhism and was both adopted and altered by each society that encountered it. Studying the text, he said, fosters an understanding of the contrast between modern Japan and the rest of Asia by illustrating how Buddhist values have affected each country. deßary also cited the Ramayana as a work that is even more useful in combating misunderstandings of South and Southeast Asia. Since the text originated in India and eventually spread its influence through the region as far as Indonesia, it provides a framework for studying modern issues in the region. Additionally, it sheds light on current ideas about laws, warrior codes, commerce, and the role of religion, according to deßary. To current students in deßary's East Asian Civilization course, the connection is obvious. Frank Wang, CC '96, said he appreciates deßary's perspective on the connection between the different cultures. ""He's very valuable as a Westerner explaining it. No one understands it all, but he's inspiring for showing that we all come from different perspectives,"" Wang said.William deßary"
196,Books Sexual Perversity,31 March 1994,"Sexual PerversityBy YAACOV ANZISKAHistory Laid Bare, by Richard Zacks, is a funny, crude, and enlightening book about the sexual habits, beliefs, and attitudes of both scholars and ordinary folks, from the ancient world of Greece and Rome until the era of United States President Warren G. Harding in 1921. Zacks uses actual documents to demonstraate the sexual mores and preferences of each era. Anybody who has taken Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization probably knows about the attitudes of the Greeks toward homosexuality, or the early Catholic Church'? harsh disapproval of sexual activity, given most reknown by St. Augustine, but even scholars will find much of interest in Zacks's book. Zacks has structured the piece so you can witness the change in attitudes over thousands of years, from the debauchery of the Romans to the abstinence of the Church, from the emphasis on the body during the Renaissance to the prudism of the Victorians. The book has myriad surprising facts; Soranos, a second-century doctor in Rome, described both birth control and abor-tion using surprisingly modern terminology; a 15th century scholar writes that all papal nominees had their testicles felt and tested because a woman had once be-come pope in 855 and died during childbirth; certain priests had entire lists of sexual sins for confession and asked people if they slept with animals, relatives, or, worse yet, nuns. The most interesting element of the book is whenZacks directly quotes famous people from each era. One can witness Napoleon's utter lack of control over his wife, the Empress Josephine. Abraham Lincoln reports how he promised, without seeing a picture, to marry a particular woman, whom he later discovered to be fat, ugly, and toothless. Luckily for our 16th president, she rejected his marriage proposal! The graham cracker, we learn, was invented by the zealous Sylvester Graham, who wanted its bland favor to reduce Americans' sexual drives. The term ""hooker"" derived from the Civil War general Joseph Hoooker, who frequented an establishment of prostitutes in Washington, D.C.The artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec adored redheads, while President Harding made use of a mistress by hiding her in a White House closet. On the less amusing side, Zacks reports that certain Western scholars tried to use particular body measurements to prove the ""bestiality"" of non-whites, such as Africans, and considered their efforts to be seriousscientific research. Unlikely as it may sound, Zacks actually has used many factual and historical sources for this book, in order to cover each period in exhaustive detail. He quotes both famous and unknown people, includingPopes, laymen, Arab scholars, and British adventurers. Zacks provides useful blurbs at the beginning of each quote to identify the author, the time period, and the significance of the remark. Unfortunately, as one may expect with this material, some of Zack's remarks are a bit immature and crude, which only excacerbates the tone of the material. Another flaw in Zacks' approach is that he doesn't provide many feminine views, quoting women sparingly. Healso loves to put intense focus on some of the more sordid details of the more sexually bizarre episodes. Yet Jacks does accomplish what he promises in the preface. Indeed, he makes history more fun, more interesting, and certainly less sanitized. He has dealt with a topic previously not studied by any serious historians, an act that is important in itself."
197,Spectrum Ben cuts loose from the steps,7 April 1994,"Ben cuts loose from the stepsBENJAMIN STRONGWith the arrival of April, I've been spending a great deal of time on the steps of Low Library. Along with the Spectator office, RiverHall, and the western staircase of Hamilton Hall, I have spent a significant pordon of my dme at Columbia on those steps. For the past three years, those majestic slabs of concrete have meant many things to me: sun, sunburn, and beer stains under my ass. However, a friend of mine just this week destroyed for me the ""myth"" of the steps. He suggested that ""step time"" was not, in fact, the wonderful experience we all believed it to be. Most of the time you spend on the steps is with people you don't really like, he observed. After considering his theory, I reluctandy agreed withhim. Generally, my friends are never on the steps at the same time as I am, and I usually end up sitting with acquaintances, surrounded by people I thought I had escaped when I moved out of Carman Hall in 1991.Thus, I was inspired, as a graduating senior who has finally learned the truth about the steps, to consider alternative locations where I may spend my final sunny days at Columbia. The following is my top 10 list of steps alternatives for members of the Class of 1994 who would like to avoid their first-year fioormates: 1) The Marlin. Come on, it's been years since you've been there. Don't you miss the mysterious Marlin man and the latest cheap beer he servesoff the tap? Granted, sunlight hasn't reached this establishment (or the Marlin man) in seven years, but that's all right since suntans, like bulimia, are so 1987. 2) The Andrew Jorgensen Memorial Wall. Yes, I know Andrew isn't dead, but just accept the name (no one ever questions the legitimacy ofcalling Wien Hall a hall). For those who are not aware, this is the wall (more of a ledge actually) which runs north-south outside of Ferris Booth Hall —a place where Andrew spent the greater part of hisfirst year at Columbia. The wall has since been claimed by younger students and birds, and has fallen into decay in recent years. 3) The West End Gate. Personally, I dislike this establishment and avoid it like Snapple, but I recognize its importance in the Columbia scene. This restaurant and bar is Morningside Heights' version of Spago; the food is terrible and overpriced, but it doesn't matter because you go there to be seen, not to eat. 4) The Hungarian Pastry Shop.I've never been able to decide if I like this place. The coffee is great, but, like the steps, it attracts precisely those people one would like to escape. My suggestion if you go is to wear either tweed or anything black, and to bring a volume by your favorite French philosopher. This disguise will allow you anonymity not only in the Hungarian, but in River as well. 5) The roof of Butler Library. Technically, one is not allowed to be in this particular location, but the experience is worth risking being caught by the stealth sleuths of Columbia Security. Hurry to visit this location, because unless someone other than John Kluge or Morris Schapiro has money burning a hole in his or her pocket, the roof may soon end up on the third floor reading room. 6) Columbia Barnes and Noble bookstore. Someone has to shop there. You won't find any books you want, since all the best professors order their course books at Barnard Bookforum, but the selection of Monarch and Cliff notes is exceptional, making the store a favorite"
198,Debating the Core: Whither the west?,18 April 1994,"By MONICA MEHTA Spectator Staff WriterThe Columbia College faculty's March decision to replace the current Cultures and Issues requirement with a MajorCultures requirement that will focus exclusively on non-West-ern cultures is the latest phase of the evolution of the school's Core Curriculum into a program that is more inclusive of traditions and ideas from outside of Europe.Introduced in the wake of World War I, the Core Curriculum was originally meant to give students from different backgrounds experience in reading and interpreting the works that contributed to Western society. Over the years, the Core has expanded to include four required classes —Contemporary Civilization (CC), Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), Art Humanities, and Music Humanities —and two semesters of classes which fulfill the current Cultures and Issues requirement. Since CC was first introducedin 1918 and Lit Hum was added in 1937, the Core has moved beyond an almost exclusively Greco-Ro-man emphasis to include more nonEuropean traditions and other historical periods, especially the Middle Ages and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In February, 1988, the Columbia College faculty passed a proposal to create the Cultures and Issues requirement that required students to complete either two semesters of courses dealing with non-European cultures or one nonEuropean cultures course, and one course on contemporary issues. But once instituted, some critics said the requirement, intended to make up for underrepresentation of non-European world areas in the Core, led to a fragmentation of learning instead of a concentrated study of other world cultures. During this academic year, theCC department has introduced a few experimental sections of the class. The experimental sections feature a syllabus that groups works on a thematic, rather than chronological basis, while other sections have expanded the usual syllabus to include more texts —such as the Koran —that have had important influence, but were not traditionally included in the class. Administrators have declined to comment on the experiments until after the classes have been completed next month. Despite the recent experimentation, many students and faculty members believe the Western focus of the Core should not be changed, at least not based on the criticism that the authors may espouse racist or elitist beliefs. Richard Billows, director of CC and an associate professor of history, said that as part of Western culture, Columbia must come to terms with the past before it can deal with the present or future. ""It might be wonderful if in the past people were treated equally, but they were not, and we can't hide that,"" Billows said. Billows also said he believes that the Core should not serve to fragment students into groups on the basis of their racial and ethnic backgrounds, but to unify them under the ideas of Western civilization.""This emphasis on difference, difference, difference, is a disease in modern society,"" Billows said. ""The Core is about understanding and developing a critical engagement with what the key ideas and traditions of Western culture are. There is no plan to make CC anything other than an introduction to Western culture."" The United Students of Color Council (USCC) and the Black Students' Organization (BSO) have been at the forefront of this year's calls to re-examine the Core. At a USCC panel discussion about the Core on March 1, BSO President Marie Louis, CC '94, criticized the absence of texts from the African tradition in the syllabi of CC and Lit Hum. Her complaint, Louis said, is based on the theory that much of the Western tradition has come from the African tradition. USCC Vice-Chair Bryonn Bain, CC '95, also emphasized the concern that although the Core need not represent the diverse student body, Columbia students are not receiving an accurate account of the origins of ideas in the texts. ""I don't think we should change [the Core] merely to duplicate the population at Columbia,"" Bain said. ""But for us to go out into the world and act as agents for change, we have to understand the foundationon which our history was built."" ""We can't do that by saying everything starts with Greece. We need to include classical texts from Asian and African traditions that influenced the Greek thinkers and philosophers,"" he added. School of General Studies (GS) Dean Caroline Bynum said she believed it was important that the Core include non-European works, particularly from the Judaic and Islamic traditions. ""I am happy with the Western emphasis in the Core as long as there is also emphasis on other traditions and as long as the Western texts are questioned in class discussion,"" Bynum said. Although many students feel that the American culture has taken elements from Eastern and Western traditions equally, Billows said Christianity's influence on the U.S. proves that the country derives most of its ideas from the West. ""American culture has developed as a Western tradition,"" said Billows. ""I don't think anyone would deny that fact."" Other students said they believe the Core should remain as it is because it has been a tradition for 75 years. ""I came to Columbia knowing that I would be studying a core of dead white men, and that's what I expected,"" Jimmy Hung, CC '95,said. Bynum and USCC are planning a lecture series entitled ""More on the Core"" next semester, in which guest speakers will offer ""experimental perspectives"" on non-West-ern texts in an attempt to reform the syllabi of the courses. ""They will present books of classical civilization outside the Western canon that have connection to Western civilization,"" Bain said. ""A lot of faculty members and administrators are for a change in the way courses are taught, and we're going to give them the chance to do that,"" USCC Political Chair Marcel Agueros, CC '96, said. Most advocates of Core reform agree that if the Core represents the University's idea of what is essential knowledge for every college student, Columbia is ignoring the rest of the world by excluding nonWestern texts from the course. ""The idea is that you're supposing a total domination of one region's thought and culture,"" Agueros said. Bain agreed, emphasizing the need for Core texts to give students a broad world view. ""We realize that ideas have no race, but the context in which we're learning tells us that any ideas of merit come from only one race,"" Bain said. ""The world is not built upon the ideas of only one race.""Defining diversity Fourth in a 6-part series"
199,Spectrum Students unite against evil,21 April 1994,"Students unite against evilBENJAMIN STRONGDuring last week's anti-racism rally on the Low Library steps, I —along with my fellow sun-worship-ers —was treated to a demonstrationby the Karate Club. Before the backdrop of banners crying out against the violent hate-crimes of bigots, I was presented with the power of the type of kicks and blows I had once believed only someone like Ralph Macchio could perform. In addition to providing a helpful model for firstyear Logic and Rhetoric students struggling with the concept of irony, this absurd scene was emblematic to me of the belligerent and divisive nature of this campus. Once again, I have been forced to confront that most profound of questions: ""Why can't we all get along?"" Every time I glance at a wall inside a campus building, I notice a flier advertising the latest ad-hoc coalition against the particular malaise to which it is currently fashionable to be opposed. These coalitions usually boast memberships smaller than the number of people one can fit into a River L-room. These organizations rarely, if ever, affect any change. I am convinced, for example, that the International Socialist Organization has no purpose beyond providing its sole (socially-inept) member with something to do (tape up flyers) when hanging out on the steps in between classes.Inevitably, we must consider what these groups could do if they were all united towards a single, collective cause. I recommend that the various stu- «dent activist organizations on this campus unite against that unfortunate problem we would all like to end. I therefore propose the immediate founding of Students United Against Various Evils (SUAVE). Face it, evil is what really lies behind all the injustices of not only Columbia's campus but those of the rest of the world. Call it what you want, but regardless of whether you believe in a Judeo-Christian ""Evil"" with a capital ""E,"" you cannot deny the presence of the Dark Side of the Force in our lives. The undeniable truth is that there is some terrible,horrible, no-good, very bad thing that causes endless misery in the world. How else may one explain the grief our generation has recently suffered at the loss of Kurt Cobain? Only an amorphous, indefinable bad thing could possibly be responsible for the theft from tortured, sensitive, misunderstood teenagers across America of their brilliant and visionary poet laureate.Even if one does not believe in any sort of objective morality, one must concede the convenience that the term evil provides as an umbrella for ev-erything wrong here at Columbia. With an all-encompassing agenda, SUAVE could be much more effective than any campus organization that presently exists, because it could potentially gain the support of the entire student body. Furthermore, such protest would undoubtedly be supported by faculty and administrators. I mean, no one likes evil, right? SUAVE is the miracle cure for which we are searching. As a large, united front comprised of an entire University community, there would be no limit to what SUAVE could accomplish. The organization couldstop those nasty, icky budget cuts and make certain that no one has to live in Wien. SUAVE could even work to maintain a Western-oriented Core Curriculum which acknowledges all the shameful things that dead white males have done and includes works representing each culture in the world. No longer will the master works of the nation of Zembla be forbidden from the Literature Humanities syllabus because of their perceived inferiorities! And the work of SUAVE would not stop at the 116 th Street gates; the group could immediately restore justice to all of Morningside Heights. To begin, SUAVE could re-transform the Mill Korean Restaurant back into a cheap, greasy-spoon dinner and finally replace the vacant Boomer's space with an HMV annex. Yes, what a wonderful place Columbia would be under the watchdog of SUAVE to reform any instance of evil from our everyday lives. Perhaps someday, if a heroic few embrace my suggestion and take up this fight, we may finally rid this campus of problems. And if SUAVE doesn't work, I suggest we unite in favor of a cause everyone supports —an issue possessing such a strong moral imperative that no one can deny its urgency. Yes, let's all work towards getting cable TV in every dorm."
200,Students waste words in Lit Hum seminars,27 September 1994,"By WINFRED TOVARD wight David Eisenhower had a valid point when he said that ""an intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows."" Well, that is certainly the case in some of the classes at Columbia College. In fact, I have discovered a new species that more clearly defines the type of intellectual found at Columbia: Homo speaktumuchicus, or ""Big-mouth,"" for short. I figure, if circumlocution affectsas many people , in the other three classes as it does in my first-year class, it has to be a contagion infecting and probably repulsing 'most of the students on campus. Though I have little college experience, I know bullshit when I hear it —mostly during discussions in Literature Humanities on Homer's ""Iliad."" Hearing some students speak sometimes just makes me want to padlock their lips. This desire does not stem from their erroneous ideas, but from the melodramatic and arrogant tone in which they give their opinions. This arrogance makes them repeat their ideas incessantly. The ""intellectuals"" in my classes (and, I am sure, in many of yourown) find a niche in the story or subject of discussion, grab onto it for dear life and for the grade, and carry the rest of the class into utter boredom and annoyance. For example, in my Literature Humanities class, I sit down and take notes, listening to the professor speak about the ""Iliad""—an interesting, 400-page poem, written by Homer and massacred by grade-crazy bigmouths who have to speak their mind. All of their mind.The ""Iliad"" is simply an account of the Trojan War and the maincharacters who add to the plot. Students must analyze Homer's ideas reflecting ancient civilization incorporated in the poem; they,however, must not base it on their 20th-century ideas. Some students, nevertheless, perceive the characters as folks from Greenwich Village or Tribeca, not as the Greeks and Trojans they were. Whenever I hear a person say: ""Well, the emotions begotten from the lines strike disgust and rage in my heart and mind,"" I get the urge to shut his or her mouth with bit-•» i o ter sarcasm and rudeness. Luckily, my professor has the capability to shut them up for me. Another big-mouth made the following comment: ""Just by analyzing the scene of Achilles' great sorrow for his deceased friend leads me to the conclusion that Achilles and Patrokles, the deceased friend, were gay lovers ..."" People, Homer did not compose this poem to discuss the issue of homosexuality; those who say otherwise are studying a little too hard and need to take a breather. The situation is quite obvious—this new species, Homo speaktumuchicus, speaks too damn much. They speak for the grade, not for the learning. They believe that they will impress the professor by talking out of both sides of their mouth to avoid direct confrontation, by advancing off-the-wall theories to explain why thepoet or author writes a piece and using elocution found in a country club where the members have their noses airborne. Although college is a time to excel in the ""grade"" department, it is also a time to open the scope of learning for self-satisfaction and for self-realization—the realization that thinking is logical and reasonable in the context of the subject—not for a letter grade on a piece of paper. Henry David Thoreau stressed ""simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!"" So, fellow students who feel the same way as I, be on the lookout for the new species Homo speaktumuchicus-, they are armed with tongues that do not stop moving, and arrogant accents so fake they fall off after class like hair weave. When you hear the warnings or feel the commentary coming on, the best advice I can give is to shoot to kill. This is the only to save the class and your sanity."
201,"Author discusses book, classic texts",13 October 1994,"By SAMANTHA NICOSIA Spectator Staff WriterNew York magazine film critic David Denby, CC '65, spoke about his forthcoming book on Columbia College's Core Curriculum last night in the Hartley Library. Denby's book, which is due out in the spring, examines Columbia's Core curriculum chronologically, from Plato to Virginia Woolf, and details Denby's experiences sitting in on Contemporary Civilization (CC) and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) classes nearly 30 years after his graduation. Denby, a former Spectator staff writer and film critic, said he first thought of writing the book in the late 1980s, when several books appeared that questioned the relevance of classical texts to presentday society. Denby said he doubts that many classical texts are still being read by the general population. ""What bugged me was the debate about the books. It was like they had vanished and had become an abstraction. My wife asked me what it had been like reading those books [as a Columbia College undergraduate], and I began to wonder if some of the authors had readthe books they were writing about,"" Denby said. While researching his book, Denby sat in on two sections of Lit Hum, and one section of CC, revisiting the texts he had first read 30 years ago as a Columbia College undergraduate. ""I came out buzzing and really pumped. I had reached a point of staleness in my career after experiencing a degree of personal success,"" Denby said. Denby said he began to realize that the ""staleness"" he felt was mirrored in the rest of the literary world. He said people today are too dependent on visual stimuli from television, movies, and computers, instead of drawing intellectual inspiration from classic texts. ""Feeling stale had certain dimensions larger than myself. The departure of literacy as a central part of our culture was being grieved over because we are at a terrifying moment when we see that things are going to change radically from a book to a visual culture,"" Denby said. While Denby visited several different sections of Lit Hum and CC, he decided to regularly attend the same three sections.""I realized my range of motion was limited because I needed stable characters—teachers and students. It was very exhilarating and I was very happy. It was thrilling to be back in Hamilton Hall. I was amazed by the stamina in these classes. I think CC and Lit Hum have gotten better because they have been embattled and had to define and justify themselves,"" Denby said. Paul Tuchman, CC '97, asked Denby about an article published in New York magazine, in which Denby described a student who appeared to be bored in a Core class that Denby had attended. In his article, Denby wrote that the student later became inspired by what he had read. Denby went onto say that he noticed a difference between his classmates in the 1960s and the Columbia students of today. ""Columbia students in the early 1960S were obsessive readers, and Columbia was a place for those kinds of freaks who were obsessively intellectual about one thing,"" Denby said. ""Students now are nicer than they were in my day and more tolerant. We were very judgmental and always cutting each other down."""
202,Awn advocates Islam in the Core,11 November 1994,"By BORIS KACHKA Contributing WriterColumbia Religion Professor Peter Awn advocated adding Muslim texts like the Koran to Core Curriculum classes last night in a speech at the Intercultural Resource Center as part of the United Students of Color Council's (USCC) Culture Month. In his speech, Awn, who teaches a Literature Humanities section, demonstrated the relevance of Muslim intellectual and religious tradition to the current texts read and discussed in Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities. He emphasized the parallels between early Islamic philosophy and the intellectual and religious ideals of the Judeo-Christian and Greek traditions. ""The Core's reading list is distorted,"" Awn said. ""It ignores one very important element, and that is the role that Islam has played fun-clamentally in the development of the European religious, intellectual, and scientific tradition."" In order to illustrate the view that European culture has always upheld ""a tradition of pushing Islamic culture as far as possible away from the ideals of Western Europe,"" Awn cited Dante's ""Inferno,"" in which Dante condemns Mohammad, the founder of Islam, to one of the lowest levels of hell. Awn attributed the aversion to Islamic ideas to the Christian notion that Islam tampered with and misinterpreted Christian scripture, but he countered that the Christian tradition had, in effect, interpreted the Jewish scriptures to create its own value system and religious canon. ""It is disheartening,"" added Awn, ""that, in these classes, there is no recognition at all that any Islamicliterary texts existed in the Medieval period that were the origins of the European literary tradition."" Awn also cited several examples of Arabic poetry which had an influence on many European poets of the Renaissance and later periods. Awn challenged the theories of certain professors who set up an irreconcilable opposition between the Muslim ideology and that of the American and European democratized society. ""We owe it to ourselves that we do not conform to such pseudointellectual cultural theories,"" Awn said, dismissing the hypothesis by focusing upon the intellectual links between Islamic works and those that comprise the canon of Western European literature. Awn particularly emphasized the need to include the Koran along with readings from the Bible. The religious link, he said, is impossible to ignore, and readings from the Koran would only enrich the students' understanding of the tradition upon which Western culture isbased. ""Not only must we include the Koran in our discussions,"" Awn said, ""but it is essential to see how our philosophical ideals were developed by Muslim intellectuals."" He illustrated his point by mentioning the ""Autobiography of AlGhazali,"" which he claimed was similar, in its balance of philosophy and religious exposition, to St. Augustine's ""Confessions,"" which is read in Lit Hum. Such a work would both provoke an more indepth discussion of religious autobiography and a deeper understanding of the role that Islamic works has played in developing the same ideals that have been explored by Christian authors, Awn said. He noted that several Contemporary Civilization professors assign both the Koran and ""Autobiography of Al-Ghazali"" in the period designated for the professor's optional reading. Violeta Chapin, CC '97, a student in one of these sections, taught by Associate Professor HamidDabashi, confirmed Awn's point, conveying her satisfaction with the questions and discussion that these works, and Dabashi's presentation of them, provokes in her class. She said she believes Islamic texts are essential ""in trying to get a wellrounded view of what CC is trying to teach us."" During the discussion after Awn's speech, USCC Political Chair Marcel Agueros, CC '95, brought up the question of how to fit these texts into courses without excluding works from the syllabus. Awn responded that one solution is to do away with the duplication of texts in Lit Hum and CC —for example, including the Bible in one, but not both of the courses. In addition, he suggested that more flexibility be given to the reading lists of both courses, and then individual instructors can include the texts they feel are essential to their sections. Agueros said he felt that Awn's speech was very effective in ""demonstrating that you can expand the core without really threatening its integrity or perceived integrity."""
203,USCC elects new educational leader,16 November 1994,"Members of the United Students of Color Council (USCC) elected Kavita Kumar, CC '97, the group's new educational chair, beating out Diego Perez, CC '98, during their meeting Monday night. On her first night in her new position, Kumar presented a proposal to the board in which she suggested improving ethnic studies at Columbia by hiring more professors of color. She also proposed opening an experimental section of Literature Humanities that would focus on literature from non-Western societies, such as India. Kumar said she wants to change the perspective of the core by ""bringing ethnic academia off the fringes and into the center."" Members also discussed the upcoming Puerto Rico Weekend, which will be sponsored by Accion Boricua and held from Nov. 1719. As part of the activities, the group will hold a citywide conference called ""Muevete: Boricua Youth Conference,"" in Wollman Auditorium. 750 junior high, high school, and college students are expected to attend. The workshops will deal with issues ranging from sexuality to Puerto Rican influence on hip hop. Community leaders, politicians, actors and actresses are expected to attend. —SUZI YUEH, Contributing Writer"
204,Hamilton dinner celebrates core,18 November 1994,"By LAUREN GOODMAN and MAURICE B. TOUEG Spectator Staff WritersIn celebration of the 75th anniversary of Columbia College's core curriculum, 75 tenured professors received recognition for their contributions to the core at the school's annual Alexander Hamilton awards dinner last night at the American Museum of Natural History. The reception and dinner, which were attended by approximately 600 alumni, administrators, faculty members, and students, featured speeches by both administrators and alumni about the past, present,and future of the core as an integral part of a Columbia education. The core, which was founded as an ""Introduction to Contemporary Civilization"" course at the end of World War I in 1919, currently includes courses in Western philosophy, literature, art, and music. University President George Rupp, Columbia College Dean Steven Marcus, and University Professor Emeritusjacques Barzun, CC '27, who accepted the award on behalf of all tenured faculty members who have taught the core, discussed many aspects of the curriculum, ranging from the need to preserve smaller class sizes, and the link between a strong undergraduate education and the development of critical thinking skills. ""As we build an even better Columbia, we will focus on the central significance of an undergraduate education at Columbia,"" Rupp said. ""At Columbia, education is a highly personal experience. We intend to keep it that way."" Dinner Committee Co-Chair Vincent Carrozza, CC '49, said that in order to protect the integrity of the core, the small class sizes, currently capped at 24 students, must not be sacrificed for financial reasons. In detailing the core's history, Marcus noted that it was begun as a reaction to the U.S. Government's fear that World War I could mean the end of Western civilization. ""The core began as a responseto the first world war, in an attempt to answer the dreadful sense of foreboding,"" Marcus said. Showing his sense of confidence that the core curriculum remains one of Columbia College's strengths, Marcus gave the audience a host of statistics for this year's first-year class, including their diversity and strong academic standing. ""In other words, things seem to be looking up for the college, which is the way things should be,"" Marcus said. Barzun said the core provides a forum for guidance and a tool to instill a set of morals by teaching students to think, instead of simply regurgitating facts. Responding to current criticism that the core centers too much on Western civilization, Barzun said, ""The truth is that in learning about the West, one learns an enormous amount about the world."" David Denby, CC '65, film critic for The New Yorker magazine, spoke about his experiences revisiting the core when he sat in on Literature Humanities and CC classes in Spring 1991. ""I came out of these classes with my heart pounding,"" Denby said, adding that he is writing a book about his experiences. Columbia College Alumni Association President Martin Kaplan, CC '6l, said that in celebration of the anniversary, several Contemporary Civilization classes will read the speeches of Fredrick Douglass this spring. ""Douglass challenges us to participate in society,"" Kaplan said.Attendees of the event saidthe core serves as the driving force behind a Columbia education. ""I am honored to be here, and it is remarkable to be celebrating what is the most outstanding, formidable undergraduate education that this country has to offer,"" former Admissions Officer Liz Pleshette, CC 'B9, said. ""[The core] is what unites Columbia as a community,"" said Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka."
205,Students discuss lack of diversity in the Core,30 November 1994,"BY SUMATHI REDDY Contributing WriterDebating issues surrounding Columbia's Core Curriculum, the United Students of Color Council (USCC) sponsored a discussion last night in Ferris Booth Hall entitled ""Shaping the Core."" Panelists included The New Yorker magazine Film Critic David Denby CC '65, Professor of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Hamid Dabashi, and Professor of East Asian Languages and Culture and Chair of the Committee on the Core Hairo Shirane. Denby is currently writing a book about returning to Columbia as an alumnus and retaking several core courses, such as Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and Contemporary Civilization (CC). Denby said he views the current debates over the lack of multiculturalism in the core as both an indication of a changing society that is facing a larger crisis—whether literacy will stay alive in a technological society.Denby said he thinks the core has improved over the years with an increase in contemporary issues and authors addressed in syllabi. He attributes this improvement to the debate over which works should be included in the canon. ""The nature of the enterprise was not in question when I was a student at Columbia,"" Denby said. Denby said he was satisfied with the texts chosen for CC and Lit Hum, but suggested that professors provide more ""historical consciousness"" to better explain the texts. Dabashi advocated discussing multiculturalism in the core, but stressed the necessity of continuing to teach the current works. ""It is part of the enterprise to be constantly engaged in such questions, but in the meantime the business of teaching can't be suspended,"" Dabashi said. In reference to the lack of non-Western texts in the Core, Shirane noted that Columbia College had introduced an extended core, or ""Major Cultures"" requirement, which was intended to encourage the study of non-Western cultures. ""My function is to continue to question the state of Lit Hum and CC and to push into effect the extended core."" Shirane said. Dabashi stressed the importance of dialogue and conversation about issues raised by the authors, rather then stressing a meticulous reading of the texts. ""As a teacher, it doesn't matter what the text is dealing with. What matters is engaging in a conversation in which the students' thoughts and anxieties are heard,"" Dabashi said. Shirane agreed with Dabashi,saying the importance of the the books is measured by what remains in the mind of the students, not the texts themselves. He said today many issues have been brought forth today that were not recognized previously, but should now be incorporated into the core. ""To continue to stimulate the mind, it is important that we reach out to more contemporary issues as well as go beyond Western-domi-nated cultures, "" he said. Denby defended the core, saying it is ""only meant to be the beginning of an education, upon which you can build."" Denby said the primary importance of the core is the ""expansion of the self,"" not the culture from which the text comes. Students in the audience hadmixed opinions about the fundamental role of the core.. Anh Nguyen, CC '9B, stressed her humanity before her identity as an Asian American. ""Through Lit Hum I'm learning things applicable to my humanity, regardless of my ethnicity. I'm learning how to read, learn, and communicate, so that I can apply these skills to future courses dealing with other cultures,"" Nguyen said. Others said the core must be diversified. ""I think something is really missing, and that is the fact that power is equivalent to knowledge,"" Swati Khurana, CC '97, said. ""There's a reason why so many sections are all focusing on a certain civilization, which implies its superiority and results in resistance.""Students joined Columbia professors in a discussion about the core curriculum. Some participants argued that today's heated debate about the core's canon results from a larger societal problem—the status of literacy in a technological world."
206,Embree gets Core award,8 February 1995,"By BORIS KACHKA and JEANNIE ROSENFELD Spectator Staff WritersColumbia College's Core Curriculum, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary, was praised as an invaluable resource to students during yesterday's presentation of the second annual Award for Distinguished Service to Professor Emeritus of History Ainslee Embree. The event, held in Faculty House, was hosted by the Heyman Center for the Hu-manities, which selected the recipient. Director of the Heyman Center and Professor Emeritus of East Asian Languages and Cultures William De Bary acknowledged Embree's contribution to the Columbia curriculum. De Bary said Embree's teaching in the Asian Civilizations and Humanities, and Contemporary Civilization (CC), as well as his service as chair of both departments, markedhis most important contributions to Columbia. During his 35 years of teaching at Columbia, Embree, who specializes in the field of Indian history, has held many administrative positions. He has served as the Chair of the Committee of Asian Studies and has also chaired the departments of Middle East Languages and Cultures, History, and Contemporary Civilization. Embree is currently president of the Association of Asian Studies, the largest Asian studies academic group in the West. Emphasizing Embree's extensive experience in the field of Indian history, De Bary said he offered a fresh perspective on CC texts. ""He could easily have withdrawn to teaching Indian History, but his commitment to the Core encouraged him to keep teaching [CC],"" De Bary said. De Bary, who is also a senior scholar, added that Embree is ""one of a fair number of exceptions of senior scholars who continue to serve the Core even when they no longer have to."" Vice President for Arts and Sciences and Dean of Columbia College Steven Marcus echoed De Bary's praise of Embree as he presented the award. ""He represents part of the evolution of the idea of theCore. It revolves around western civilizations while trying to include in its scope the history of other civilizations,"" Marcus said. During his acceptance speech, Embree shared some of his diverse teaching experiences. Embree recalled how a friend had once told him, '""What you're teaching about India must be wrong. You make it seem so sensible.'"" At the reception following the presentation, Embree expressed his gratitude to his colleagues and to Columbia. ""I'm terribly honored and pleased. I've enjoyed immensely my experiences at Columbia,"" Embree said. Embree added that he is grateful to Columbia for""the great freedom we have to teach the classes we want to."" Coordinator of Literature Humanities and CC Eileen Gilooly noted Embree's accomplishments inside the classroom, particularly in his CC classes. ""The students love him, and I've had to turn students away from his section. He's incredibly witty, erudite, and versatile,"" Gilooly said. Although Embree no longer chairs the CC department, he still teaches a course on human rights in Asia as a retired senior scholar. Associate Dean of the School of International and PublicAffairs Robin Lewis reflected on his experience as a Ph.D. candidate working under F.mbree. Lewis noted Embree's ""very effective pedagogical technique,"" and his ""insistence on forcing people away from their comfortable intellectual moorings."" ""He is a real inspiration in his brilliance and, not least of all, in his generosity,"" Lewis added. ""People should know how to read, write, and think,"" said Professor of English and Comparative Literaturejames Mirollo, highlighting the importance of the Core Curriculum. Mirollo, who has taught Literature Humanities since 1974 and has chaired the department, received the award last year with Professor of History J.W. Swit. In affirming the relevance of the Core Curriculum as it marks its 75th anniversary, Mirollo said that while assisting in the Columbia College Office of Admissions, he discovered that nearly eight out of 10 applicants say they want to come to Columbia because of the Core. The subjects of the Core give students ""cultural empowerment,"" he added, due to their universalism and enduring relevance. ""If the books didn't speak to the present then we wouldn't read them,"" he said. Mirollo acknowledged the importance of adjusting the course's reading list, but said the structure of the program didn't need to change. ""I only hope the small classes don't change,"" he added, saying the intimate setting is essential for the program's success. ""I'd teach the telephone book, as long as we do it this way,"" he said. Alan Miller, CC '56, who has taken one Alumni Colloquium per semester for the past eight years, remembered his Columbia education fondly and said he appreciates having a second chance to relearn the ""great works."" ""[The Core] helps you understand where you are and where you are going and gives the background to understand it all,"" Miller said.Professor Ainslee Embree (left) with Professor William De Bary at a ceremony honoring Embree's contribution to the Core Curriculum."
207,CC requirements to be reexamined this spring,15 February 1995,"By BORIS KACHKA Spectator Staff WriterColumbia's Contemporary Civilization (CC) course—one of the pillars of the Core Curriculum, which celebrates its 75th anniversary this year—will be reexamined this April for possible curriculum revision, pending a departmental review of the experimental CC sections offered during the past two years. According to Chair of CC Associate Professor of History Richard Billows, the department will discuss changes to the CC syllabus by April 12.The six experimental CC sections currently in place will not be offered next fall, since they were intended only as a testing ground for new ideas and changes in the syllabus, according to Billows. ""We're going to incorporate elements from both experimental sections into the program. One doesn't want permanently to have completely different tracks for [CC],"" Billows said. The experimental sections are divided into two groups of three sections each,according to Coordinator of Literature Humanities and CC Eileen Gilooly. The first group, of which Billows teaches one section, consists of what Gilooly referred to as ""track A"" sections. These classes are similar to regular CC sections, as they present the material in chronological order, but may also include less traditional readings such as Supreme Court cases. The second group, the ""track B"" sections, present the material in a thematic way, generally paying less attention to chronology. The syllabus is divided into four segments, each of which explores a general theme in the Western political and philosophical tradition. Billows said the track A section ""tries to more clearly foreground particular themes and issues."" ""We've added a few diverse texts that were not in the standard sections. In doing this, we are largely concerned with the aim of bringing out the important issues clearly,"" Billows said. Administrative Assistant of English and Comparative Literature Nigel Gibson, who teaches a track B section, said he has divided his syllabus into four themes: the Subject of Knowledge; Questions of Ethics; Power, Politics, and Society; and Culture and Difference. Gibson said that the track B sections, due to their disregard for chronology, can give equal weight to all time periods and movements of philosophy. ""We're trying to bring to bear certain questions in a more thematic way, rather than tacking them on at the end,"" Gibson said. ""I think that students in the regular sections begin to lose the idea of where the theme is going halfway through the course,"" he added, asserting that a course organized around themes can give the students a better understanding of the material. Gibson said this new structure also allows the syllabus toinclude less traditional texts in its exploration of various themes. ""We're bringing in readings other than the canonical texts,"" Gibson said. ""Western civilization isn't such a homogeneous thing."" Billows said the experimental sections allow for broader interpretations of the texts, adding that some of these new perspectives should be incorporated into regular CC sections next year. Billows said the course should seek ""to approach these texts critically,"" and added that ""this is not a set of canonical and authoritative texts."" Although Billows said the CC department would incorporate ideas from both tracks into the course in the future, he affirmed that some elements of track B were probably not going to be adopted. ""It's best to stick to a chronological course,"" Billows said of the future changes. Despite his views on the feasibility of different syllabi, Billows emphasized that no definite decisions have yet been made. ""I think we will be able to achieve a reasonable consensus on this,"" Billows said. Gibson said the thematic structure of the track B sections should not be eliminated. ""The students' opinion is that it's been a success,"" he said. ""I don't think this way [track B] should be the only way, but I think it should be a way,"" Gibson said. Rebecca Braverman, CC '97, who is currently in the section taught by Gibson, agreed that the thematic structure of the classes allows students to approach the texts with fresh perspectives. ""You're able to look at philosophy in terms of something besides when it was written. I think it makes CC a hell of a lot more interesting,"" Braverman said. Braverman said she thought experimental sections seem to be a better alternative to the regular classes, and that thethematic structure should be incorporated into more CC sections. ""In classes like mine, there's a freedom for the professor to bring in more and make the class less limiting,"" Braverman said. Yael Rosenblat, CC '97, a student in the section taught by Billows, said her course syllabus differs relatively little from the syllabi of regular sections. ""I didn't know it was an experimental section until recently,"" said Rosenblat, who has been taking the course since September. She said the less traditional reading material from the course, such as the Koran and the works of Maimonides, makes for more compelling discussions. ""Because our syllabus is so multicultural, it brings everyone into the discussion,"" Rosenblat said. Rosenblat added that Billows' extensive knowledge of the historical background of the works enhanced the educational experience. Robin Sacks, CC '97, who attended a track A section taught by Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History Wim Smit last semester, also said her course was similar to regular sections. Sacks said the section did not help her more firmly grasp the overall themes and objectives of the CC course. ""I still don't know what the objective of the course is,"" Sacks said. Sacks said she thinks the chronological presentation of the course material is an advantage. ""That puts them in their historical context,"" Sacks said, adding that she thinks more contemporary themes should be discussed throughout the course. Although some students may think changes in the syllabi would be uncharacteristic of CC courses, the course has met with many changes since its inception 75 years ago."
208,Oldies But Goodies,20 April 1995,"By YAACOV ANZISKABy YAACOV ANZISKA In Pursuit of Meaning-Classic Texts from Columbia's Core Curriculum is a fascinating exhibit, both in terms of its artistic and literary merit. The display is located in the Rare Books room on the sixth floor of Butler Library, which is difficult to find but is well worth the effort. The exhibit focuses on 10 ofthe following texts taught in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization: the Bible, the Iliad, the Odyssey, Aeneid, King Lear, Starry Messenger and Letter to Christina of Galileo, Common Sense and the Rights of Man, and the Communist Manifesto. Over 100 items are on display, mostly from private collections, that celebrate Columbia's Core Curriculum by focusing on the most important part of the course, the texts. By looking at the different copies and texts, one is able to chart the history of manuscript art and printing, since the exhibit contains texts from the 10th century until the present. The collection begins with the Bible and presents different translations of it throughout the centuries. The early Bibles are from the 10th century and are relatively restrained, with little color or ornamentation, just ink on parchment. Interestingly, one of the Bibles is from the Samaritans, a small sect in Israel who possess only the Old Testament. I was surprised by the legibility and beauty of the handwriting of a 12th century New Testament. Though it was not supplemented with any color or art, it seemed as though the text had been printed. In the ""Paris Bible"" of 1200, the first letter of each paragraph is enlarged and colored either red or blue, with fancy red designs around it, which were chain-like and coiled. A very interesting Bible was the Biblia Polyglotta, which contained the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin versions of the Old and New Testaments, as well as a column for Hebrew roots at the edgeof the page. The Gutenberg Bible of the 1400s contains a mostly printed text, but the beginnings and ends of chapters are filled in by a rubricator, who used blue and red. Despite the printing press, individual art still flourished to some degree in the Bibles. Some Bibles possess little pictures of men, probably the Saints, at the beginning of each new chapter. A leaf from a Bible in the 1600s depicts the scene of God taking Eve out of the sleeping Adam. This picture is encircled by praying angels, dressed in tunics of that era, led by God, who is portrayed as an old man. The Bible section is the most interesting and comprehensive part of the exhibit, and Columbia managed to obtainsome fine examples of Biblical art. Another part of the exhibit focuses on the Iliad and the Odyssey. There are papyrus fragments from approximately 2000 years ago that had been part of a scroll containing the Iliad. The exhibit, a bit whimsically, displays the copy of Ulysses , by James Joyce, that had been seized by United StatesCustoms, with the ""pornographic passages"" marked by the District Attorney. This section also has ""emblem books,"" pictures of scenes in the Iliad, with mottos or commentary underneath. One scene shows Achilles killing Hector, with some of the Gods cheering in the background. A print, The Judgement of Pans, by Marco Dente, depicts a scene in which the Gods lounge around, with the three goddesses handing the Golden Apple to Paris. This print tries to imitate ancient Greek art, especially its statues, because the figures in the painting are all well-proportioned and muscular. Alexander Pope, in 18th century England, translated the Iliad, and drew Achilles'sshield. The shield is circular and contains scenes, arranged chronologically, of a village at peace, at war, then at peace, with singing and dancing. This circular story surrounds a smaller circle of the signs of the Zodiac. The Aeneid was another popular book that was widely translated starting in the Middle Ages. One translation contains pic-u O I tures of the scenes of the book, such as Aeneas in the Underworld or the Greeks leaping out of the Trojan Horse. The settings and costumes feature Northern European-style architecture and dress and comment on the contemporary social problems. For example, in a scene showing Aeneas surrounded by local Italians, the men carry a flag with a ""Bundschuhn,"" a sandal on it, which was the symbol of the revolutionary peasants in Germany in the 1500s. A translation in England gives Aeneas the hooked nose of King William, surrounded by little angels, while another gives him a mustache. A print by John Mortimer (1776) for a volume of King Lear characterizes Lear as a raging and titanic figure, who is quite disturbed emotionally. His bulging eyes, windblown hair, and ripped shirt, all hint at his lunacy, especially since he does not gaze at the viewer but looks to the side. In the Galileo section, there is a metal ""armillary sphere,"" with the earth in the center of the sphere. Galileo's Starry Messenger contains diagrams of the moon detailing its rough surface, drawings done only with the aid of a telescope. A later publisher, Andreas Cellarius, printed a colorful chart with the planets (Jupiter even has satellites) orbiting the sun (with a little face in it), astronomers at the edge of the chart playing with their instruments, and a circle of the signs of the Zodiac around the entire solar system.Toward the end, the exhibit contains a piece of Tom Paine's hair, as well as a great number of different published versions of Common Sense. It also has the Communist Manifesto in a radical newspaper, preceded by a picture of a fat king and skeleton soldier, sitting on a poor and weak man, chained to the ground. This exhibit is quite informative as well as visually appealing, and should be seen by everybody who had to sit through CC and Lit. Hum (and who actually read the books). Columbia does not have many traditions, but it has chosen to celebrate one of its few in a scholarly and enjoyable manner, right on campus. The exhibit is short, sweet, and only five minutes away (if the elevators in Butler work)."
209,"Undergraduates evaluate course, professor quality",28 April 1995,"By HARRIET RYAN Spectator Staff WriterWith groans of ""Does anybody actually read these?"" and""I haven't had a #2 pencil since the SATs"" coming from students in classes ranging from art history to organic chemistry, course evaluations were distributed in most undergraduate classes this week. The end-of-the-semester forms give students the opportunity to rate an instructor's accessibility, grading system, and overall teaching ability. Despite some student skepticism, undergraduate administrators said the semester evaluations are taken seriously by faculty members and academic departments. Associate Dean of Columbia College Katherine Yatrakis said the primary purpose of evaluations is to give teachers insight into how they could improve their courses. ""[Evaluations] were always meant to educate the instructors,"" Yatrakis said. According to Barnard College Acting Vice President and Dean of the Faculty FloraDavidson, compulsory course evaluations grew out of a faculty initiative in the mid1980s. Davidson said although Barnard administrators made generic evaluation forms available, about half of the departments designed their own evaluation forms, and all the information collected was evaluated on the departmental level. ""Most of the evaluations are used as feedback for designing the course in the future,"" Davidson said, adding that most department chairs also read the evaluations. Davidson also said student input plays a role in tenure evaluations and third-year reviews for junior faculty members. ""Whenever there's any kind of decision about promotion to be made, course evaluations are required to be included,"" Davidson said. The School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) makes the results of its evalu-ations available on line through Columbianet, showing how many students filled out evaluations for a specific course as well as the grades—A through F —that they assigned their professors in a variety of categories. Several students said they were more likely to fill out the forms in smaller classes like Core Curriculum classes or seminars. Catherine Chambers, BC '97, said although she thought the evaluations for large lecture classes ask ""plausible"" questions, instructors in smaller classes often seem to value the evaluations more intently. ""I've taken courses where they're read very closely. In those classes, the teacher already has a lot ofinteraction with the students,"" Chambers said, citing her writing instructor at Barnard's Writing Fellows Program as an example. ""She told us how much she wanted thoughtful responses."" Megan Kearney, CC '9B, said that last fall, she took the time to write a thorough evaluation of her Literature Humanities instructor even though she knew she was switching into another section for the spring semester. ""It wasn't a fair class. There were real problems with the way she taught so everyone in the class took the evaluations really seriously,"" Kearney said, adding that she had heard from people who remained in the section that the instructor was""on review"" and hadimproved her teaching style. ""I hear that she's a lot better, that there's more discussion this semester,"" Kearney said. Nehal Chokshi, SEAS '97, said although he values course evaluations, he thought the timing of the evaluations hindered their effectiveness. ""It's hard to get 300 students to give their best effort when they have much more pressing issues to deal with,"" Chokshi said."
210,SPECTATOR SPECTRUM Carman 12: The real classroom,17 May 1995,"Carman 12: The real classroomAdam J. EpsteinWe were supposed to be studying for an exam. It was midnight, nine hours before an economics final, and we were justbreaking out our notes in a cramped John Jay single. Somehow we quickly veered off the subject at hand and started discussing the U.S. Constitution. For three hours,we debated what the framers intended, argued what the next constitutional amendment should be, and wondered if there would ever be a revolution and another Constitutional Congress. The discussion was intense. We took sides, argued a position. Then switched sides. This went on for hours. Since our econ notes were out, we felt we were studying. Instead, we were learning. My parents sent me to Columbia for an excellent education. Four years later, I'm proud to report I received one. My parents idea was that this education would take place in a classroom. I would go to classes, study, and get good grades. While that is certainly one component of the Columbia experience, I believe the vast majority of the Columbia education comes in the dormitories, in the dining halls, and while sitting on the Steps —from other students. In essence, most universities are the same. Every school uses the same textbooks and the same syllabi. Sure, our faculty may be a cut above, but certainly not enough tojustify $27,000 a year. But sitting on a desk in John Jay, a dormitory named after the Columbia graduate who, as Chief Justice, was the first arbiter of the Constitution, it made sense—the real Columbia education is learned outside the classroom. The Core Curriculum and Carman Hall are perfect examples of this learning atmosphere. Asfreshmen w& all took the same Core classes. During the day, we sat in the classroom studying the works of Homer, Thucydides, and Aeschylus and at night we could talk it over back in the freshman dorm. Not only does it create an excellent bond, it is a wonderful way to learn. A couple of years later, our constitutional discussion is sprinkled with names and theories picked up in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. As a student body, we are among the most active in the country. Almost every person is heavily involved in at least two extracurricular activites. Weekday nights are filled with students rushing off to meetings, rehearsals, and, because this is still Columbia, protests. Although the undergraduate population numbers just 5,000, the number of clubs, student publications, a cappella groups and political organizations is equal to that of a 20,000student school. Columbia has always attracted and admitted applicants that were self-motivated. While other schoolslook only at GPAs and SATs, Columbia is more interested in what the applicant will add to the community.This is what differentiates Columbia. This is why Columbia provides the best education in the country.More than once my parents have looked at my report cards and wondered aloud if they were wasting their money. I"
211,Pointers to plan your first semester classes Finishing the Core early is key to Columbia College,28 August 1995,"Finishing the Core early is key to Columbia CollegeBy MAURICE B. TOUEG Spectator News EditorAny incoming Columbia College student who is not yet familiar with the words ""Core Curriculum"" may want to consider transferring to another, less rigorous institution, perhaps in Philadelphia or Ithaca. As a first-semester Columbian about to choose your first college classes, you should already know that the Core Curriculum will take up much of your time. In fact, the Core will define the structure of your schedule for the next two years, so it's a good idea to think about when you should take your Core classes now. Instead of reading the entire blue course catalog to choose your classes, all you need to read is this article —unless, of course, you don't want to bother thinking about school yet. My first semester I decided to take it easy and get adjusted to college life by taking only four classes. Going out every night was a regular practice and Broadway milkshakes at Tom's Diner were standard fare. Columbia recommends that students take either 15 or 16 points per semester to graduate on time. If you have advanced placement credits, you are in an even better position to take four classes. It is possible to take four classes adding up to 15 points, but you just have to know how to choose those classes. If your name falls in the first half of the alphabet, your first semester as a Columbia College student will be consumed with writing many, many papers for a class called Logic & Rhetoric, or ""L&R."" This class can at first be intimidating, because instructors actually assign homewprk, so my advice is thatif you have to take L&R first semester, do so with only three other classes. If you get lucky and are able to postpone L&R until second semester, fulfill either the language requirement (four points) or part of the science requirement during your first semester. Your second class should either be Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), a year-long survey class in Western literature, or Contemporary Civilization (CC), another staple of the Columbia College Core Curriculum focusing on Western philosophy, religion, and political science. My advice is to take Lit Hum now and save CC for'your sophomore year. Lit Hum is a big reader course so you will need to devote a large chunk of time for the class. My third suggested class is either Art Humanities or Music Humanities, the other main elements of the Core Curriculum. While some students save these classes until their final two years at school, completing one of them in the first semester is not a bad idea. You may even like them, as I did, and decide to take other advanced classes in the future. Your fourth class should be a class for you. If you are dying to take ""Principles of Economics,"" go for it. If you find the ""History of the City of New York"" an interesting topic, have a party, but if you take any advice from this article, don't limit yourself to required classes during your first semester. Do it like Mo and take calculus. And by the way, if you are scrounging for a point, take a gym class. You need two semester's worth to graduate, and the physical education department has about 20 different classes, so get physical and get that last point."
212,Baker's historical perception skewed,12 September 1995,"By CHAS SISKOver the past few decades, a disturbing attitude change has taken place in the civil rights movement. Frustrated by what is perceived as a lack of progress in the quest for equality, many minority leaders have begun to attack white people with bigoted stereotypes in an effort to paint Europeans and their descendents as the source of all evil. It seems many have forgotten that racist prejudices are dangerous political cards to play. You would think such unfairness would not be allowed in Columbia's politicallycorrect atmosphere, but as Sharod Baker showed us on these pages [""Multiculturalism a mask for white supremacy,"" Spectator, Sept. 7], some people haven't forgotten how to be bigoted. In hiscolumn, Baker attacks Europeans, blaming them—and by extension all white people, everywhere—for all of the world's ills. His exact words were: ""Europeans destroyed civilization by fusing African and Asian ideologies with unprecedented amounts of greed, hate, wickedness, and violence."" He calls on Columbia to do a better job of teaching nonEurocentric history so we can all truly understand how peaceful and Utopian the world was before European colonialists came along. Unfortunately, it seems Baker would be well advised to take that course as well. It seems he has forgotten that colonization, slavery, and invading hordes existed long before Europeans ""finally came out of the caves and ventured out of the continent,"" as he so beautifully puts it. He seems to haveforgotten about the Ghanaians of West Africa who controlled a vast empire full of slaves long before the European slave traders arrived. He seems to have forgotten about the Mongolians, who under Genghis Khan forged an imperial empire that would make the Romans envious. He also seems to have forgotten that these same Mongolians invented polo, the ultimate game of the European aristocracy, often using the heads of their enemies as game balls. The Egyptians, Hittites, Babylonians, Sumerians, and countless other expansionist societies that rose and fell before the Romans began to colonize seem to have slipped Baker's mind. WhatBaker should keep in mind is that aggression existed long before Europeans began practising it in large scale; the first major conquerors in the world were the same Asian and African cultures that he so muchwants us to learn about. The existence of these civilizations does support one of Baker's claims: that the world did not start with the Greeks. He accurately points out that many Greek ideologies can be traced back to more ancient societies. This is true, but unfortunately many of these writings have been lost. Some of the writings that have survived are studied in many Core Curriculum classes, which Baker fails to note. For example, many Literature Humanities students read ""Gilgamcsh,"" the Babylonian classic that is considered to be the first epic. Also, many of you may recall that two African writers are already present in the Literature Humanities canon, Apuleus and St. Augustine. For some reason, Baker chooses to ignore these writers when he says,""It isdifficult to imagine that the original civilizations were African and that they had rich written and spoken language, when one has been taught in a system that perpetuates white supremacy."" I guess the problem with these writers is that their greatness is already recognized by the white supremacist move-ment Columbia endorses. According to Baker, all the ideas put fortli by white thinkers over the eons are nothing but rip-offs of African and Asian philosophers. This of course makes Plato, Socrates, and the like nothing but plagiarists and intellectual thieves, because they don't cite their sources in their writings. However, this works both ways. Never in Martin Luther King's speeches does he stop to give thanks to Henry DavidThoreau or Mahatma Gandhi, from whose teachings he developed his philosophy of passive resistance. Passiveresistance led to great events in American history like the March on Washington and countless sit-ins all over the country. If Plato is to be vilified for taking someone else's idea, then shouldn't the same be done to today's philosophers? Perhaps the wiser thing to do is to recognize that philosophy is a building process in which one takes the ideasthat he or she has learned about and adds,to them. This would mean not viewing the Greeks as the first civilized culture in a savage world, but as the keepers of all the knowledge developed up to that point. Instead of attacking whites, what activists such as Baker should be doing is offering solutions to the fact that there are many glaring omissions in the Columbia Core. For one, they should call for the addition of more non-European philosophers, such as LaoTse and Mohammed. Perhaps students who are concerned about the apparent F.urocentricity of the Core should recognize that the works we do read are great. Then, they should work out a compromise with the University that would give students a more well-rounded education. The current policy of dividing people up racially will not only kill any attempt at a balanced Core; it may also lead to a renewal of the social and racial chaos we like to think we've left behind."
213,Simpson verdicts captivate campus,4 October 1995,"By AVA LIU Contributing WriterThe Columbia campus was abuzz yesterday with people anxiously awaiting and reacting to the 1 p.m. unsealing of the verdicts in the double-murder trial of Orenthal James Simpson, which captivated the world and news media for more than a year.The not-guilty verdicts —reached Monday after just four hours of deliberation —left some people rejoicing and others bitterly criticizing what they saw as an example of the breakdown of the American criminal justice system.A random sampling of more than 20 people on campus yesterday revealed that most harbored strong resentments over the verdict and felt that a guilty man had walked free after committing the stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman last.year. Still, several said that reasonabledoubt was shown, and that the jury came to the correct decision. Impromptu ""verdict parties"" sprang up around campus yesterday and many classes erupted into hearty debates over the trial's outcome. The emotions displayed on Simpson's face as he awaited the verdict were scrutinized by Columbia's students as they congregated in television lounges all over campus. Some were late for their 1:10 p.m. classes, while others planned to skip them altogether. Shant Barsoumian, CC '99, gathered with friends on the sixth floor television lounge of Carman Hall to await the verdict. Barsoumian said he would likely be lateto class, as he glanced impatiently at his watch. ""Well, I'll eventually go,"" he said. Then, as the verdict was read and relief washed over Simpson's face, some students in the lounge cried out in disbelief. ""This is the biggest travesty in the history of American justice,"" said Christopher Ball, CC '99, who sat with Barsoumian while the verdict was read. Chloe Friedman, CC '99, a seventh-floor Carman resident who watched the proceedings in the floor's television lounge, said she could not believe that with all the evidence given, Simpson was still a free man. ""I think I'm moving to another country,"" she said. Law students Howard Caro and Lee F.german, who shared a bench on the ground floor of Jerome L. Greene Hall yesterday afternoon after the reading of the verdict, agreed that the trial's outcome pointed to inherent weaknesses in the criminal justice system. ""The criminal justice system is rotten,""Caro said, ""and that reflects on the American society. With half as much evidence, anyone else would've been convicted.""F.german agreed, saying that the trial's outcome revealed that a wealthy man charged with a serious crime will not be held accountable for his wrongs. ""For a law student,"" Fgerman said, ""it's a bit disillusioning to see such a strong case of injustice.""But some students interviewed said they did not believe Simpson was found innocent only because he a successful black man, and that domestic violence—not race—was the focal point of the trial. ""Everyone wants to make it a race issue, but it isn't. It's just some guy and his ex-wife,"" said Jon-Mychal Bowman, CC '99. Thomas Hochleutner, SEAS '99, agreed. ""All the trial proved was that it doesn't matter what race you are. If you're white, black, Hispanic, Asian, whatever, as long as you're rich, you can get away with murder,"" Hochleutner saidBut some University students and staffsaid they believed that justice was served, and that Simpson is innocent. ""The verdict was just,"" said Lenore Washington, who works at Columbia Health Services. ""With the evidence given, he couldn't have done it. The media was just making it a big issue."""
214,Is the Core inherently racist? Students discuss,11 October 1995,"By ELI SANDERS Contributing WriterAt the first in a series of ""More on the Core"" forums, Visiting Professor of History Franklin Odo and approximately 25 students discussed issues concerning the Core Curriculum, with some claiming that the Core is tool of Europebased cultural domination through its exclusion of non-Western works. The discussion, which wassponsored by the United Students of Color Council (USCC), was held in Ferris Booth Hall last night. With respect to Columbia's status as the last Ivy League school with a strictly set curriculum, Odo—who will be teaching Contemporary Civilization for the first time this spring—said ""there is a kind of perverse pride in maintaining a last bastion of this sort of thing."" Odo went onto relate the experiences of his daughter, Rachel Odo, CC '92, and her perspective on the Core as a graduate. ""Having come from a bad academic high school, she was glad to be able to read the Core's important and interesting works, but concerned that a lot of other students came out feeling they had masteredthe important elements of civilization,"" Odo said. Odo said his daughter felt that students could not receive a truly broad education without studying in greater depth the contributions of non-Western cultures. Based on information gathered in an informal survey he conducted among Columbia College students, Odo reported that he feels the Core is generally supported and accepted as an institution at Columbia. ""Very few people want to abandon the Core, and a minority of the population feels that the Core needs to be revised from its focus on dead white males to the best contributors to contemporary civilization,"" Odo said. In the discussion that followed, audience members mainly took issue with the Core's perceived shortcomings, and its Western orientation. ""The fact that we study a curriculum which is European-based ignores the contributions of others to our society,"" said Jessica Lein, CC '99. ""More and more, Western culture is becoming only one of many in our society, and the curriculum doesn't acknowledge that.""Others in the audience said they view the Core more as a tool for critiquing the basis of American civilization. Adria Armbrister, CC '9B, said the influence of Egyptians on the development of ancient Greece should be considered when devising a core curriculum. ""If our thrust is to trace civilization back to its origin, then we should be tracing it back to its real origin instead of stopping at some secondary source,"" Armbrister said. Several audience members also questioned the impact of the curriculum on minorities. Having come to Columbia from an inner-city high school, Adina Berrios, CC '9B, said experiences in Core classes can lead to feelings of exclusion from what she said was a white-domi-nated power structure. ""All of a sudden you didn't see yourself, period. If you are coming from that kind of background it is easy to feel excluded,"" Berrios said. While trial changes have been attempted in certain Core sections, as evidenced by the teaching of the Koran in several Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) classes last year, some students at the forum said theadministration did not follow up on the changes. Violeta Chapin, CC '97, said she enjoyed studying the Koran in her Lit Hum class last year, but was frustrated. ""I felt like Columbia just threw us a bone and never asked what we thought of it,"" she said. Students also expressed frustration with the quality of teaching in the Core. ""The real hypocrisy is that most professors aren't trained in the Core anyway,"" said Marcel Agueros, CC'96,. ""They just feci they are qualified to teach the curriculum Ix.'cause 'Hey, it's the Core.'"" Odo said he would consider the students' opinions as he prepares to teach Contemporary Civilization. ""I want to initiate discussions about the text as we go through it to subject the text to the usual kinds of criticism and also think about that text in relation to its place in the world,"" Odo said ""I hope to have holistic criticism which brings many backgrounds to the interpretation of the text.""Vicki Feaver, an English poet, shared some of her works at a reading held last night in the Miller Theater."
215,English program copes with losses Department faced budget cutbacks and lost faculty,3 November 1995,"Department faced budget cutbacks and lost facultyBy DANIEL PIANKO Spectator Staff WriterDue to budget cuts and difficulties granting junior faculty members tenure, the Department of English and Comparative Literature has lost about 20 percent of its faculty over the last five years. The department has fallen from a high of 51 full-time faculty members during the 1989-90 school year to 43 members this year, said Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen. However, according to departmental representatives and documents, the number of faculty members has fallen to 40. ""Every administration in Low Library has a different way of counting [faculty],"" Associate Chair of the English and Comparative Literature Department James Shapiro said of the different numbers. Cohen has decided to authorize three new ""lines,"" or new faculty appointments, for the 1996-7 year. The precipitous decline in the number of faculty has had an affect on the department's ability to meet its obligations to its graduate and undergraduate students and the rest ""bF the UrfiVefsity"", faculty members said. ""We are hard pressed to cover everything,"" Shapiro said. ""I don't believe the department has been crippled by the budget cuts,"" said Professor of English and Comparative Literature Andrew Delbanco. ""We do need to rebuild. With some augmentation of our resources, we can offer an excellent undergraduate English major."" Cohen was especially concerned with what he termed the ""velocity""of decline, saying that he thinks the department's ability to meet its obligations has been stretched to the limit. The severe drop in faculty resulted from ""attrition from the budgetary squeeze and failure to promote junior faculty within and through the ranks,"" said Chair of the English and Comparative Literature Department Michael Seidel. After the budget crisis in 1989, the department was slated to havereduced its number of faculty to 46j Seidel said. In recent years, the department has lost nine junior members. Four were not recommended for tenure at the departmental level; one was not granted an ad-hoc committee on tenure by the University; two were granted ad-hoc committees that lasted over a year, but were eventually suspended; one left for another job before departmental review; and another may leave for another job before departmentalreview, according to Seidel. Seidel called the tenure process ""cumbersome,"" but also acknowledged that disagreements within the department had made it difficult to support unanimously candidates for tenure promotions. ""[The] department couldn't develop sufficient unanimity to make it look to the administration that a particular promotion was the will of the department,"" Seidel said. ""Vice President jSbhen was the first administrator in the last threeyears other than [Associate Dean of Columbia College] Kathryn Yatrakis to listen to us, and we feel now that Low Library has an understanding of how the department works and what it does,"" vSeidel added. Cohen said he authorized the faculty lines to stop the department from declining further. was quick to argue against comparing the current number of faculty members to the numbers from only recent years. ""The question is, faculty size relative to what?"" Cohen said. The department is now virtually the same size as it was 10 years ago, Cohen said. While the number of faculty members has declined over the past five years, the department's obligations to the rest of the University have not changed. The department is responsible for teaching 25 sections of Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and administering the writing program commonly referred to as Logic and Rhetoric. ""We had a hard time convincing the previous Arts and Sciences administration that the hemorrhaging of faculty would have an effect on things near and dear to the institution's heart, like Lit Hum,"" Seidel said. In addition, many English professors questioned whether Columbia would be able to maintain the size of its 40-student graduate program because of the shrinking job market for Ph.Ds and the pressure the program places on teaching resources.""The graduate program should probably shrink a bit. [lt] is one of the jewels of the Arts and Sciences and one of the country's major centers for study of American 1 iterature,"" Professor of English and Comparative Literature Jean Howard said. Additionally, some faculty members direct as many 15 or 20 dissertations ""which leaves very little room for attention to undergraduates and makes it impossible to give each grad student what he or she deserves,"" Delbanco said. With the current stress on the resources of each faculty member, some English professors worry they will no longer have the time to contribute their expertise to a variety of programs, like the gender institute, and the African American studies program. ""It would be a pity to lose those gains because of the reduced number of faculty we have now,"" Howard said. Additionally, the faculty must decide who the University should hire to fill the positions Cohen promised. ""We should be looking for people of internationally recognized intellectual stature who are committed to liberal education for undergraduate students as well as graduate students training to become members of the academic profession,"" Delbanco said. ""[The new professors should be] people 'who have changed as the discipline has changed,"" Howard said. ""Some people were trained by people who are still in the 19505."""
216,EDITORIAL Of Logic and Rhetoric,9 November 1995,"Of Logic and RhetoricThe acknowledged decline of Columbia's Department of English and Comparative Literature represents recent administrative budgetary policies in full bloom. Five years of economic attrition leave the department understaffed and unable to fulfill its obligations to undergraduate and graduate students and to the University. With departmental review and more budget cuts forthcoming, the administration has demonstrated the ineptitude of its programs for expanding class size while downsizing resources by bringing Columbia English, once among the best in the nation, to its present state of deficiency and devolution. The loss of faculty within the department shows the effects of the University's fiscal difficulties most visibly. Departmental representatives fix the current number of full-time faculty members at 40, down from a high of 51 during the 1989-90 school year. While officials cite failures to promote junior faculty—nine junior members left the department in the last few years alone—as well as budget cuts to explain the drop, financial factors remain central.With increasing workloads for individual professors, intensified competition for fewer tenured positions, and no end to downsizing in sight, it's not surprising that many junior faculty members sought stable and lucrative opportunities elsewhere. The department's problems put a number of University programs at risk. Columbia's 40-student graduate program faces immediate reduction. Shrinking departmental resources make administration of the writing program (Logic and Rhetoric) and of the 25 sections of Literature Humanities required by the University burdensome. As the department delegates new responsibilities to each faculty member, professors have less time to devote to programs like the gender institute and African American studies. Departmental representatives feel ""hard-pressed"" to cover the entire scope of study within their jurisdiction, and professors cannot now supply the attention students deserve. As a growing student body produces more demands on the department, these problems are exacerbated.Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen's authorization of three new faculty appointments for the coming year provides.needed assistance, but doesn't alleviate the department's situation in the long term. The move resembles exactly the disorganized leadership within Arts and Sciences departmental review was set up to change. Administrators continue to institute policies and restrictions with little regard for their effect on the various departments that experience them directly. The sudden decline of Columbia's English Department offers an example of the consequences accompanying the marriage of budget cuts and expanding enrollment. Departmental review offers the best hope for avoiding similar decisions in the future. Administrators can no longer ignore the implications of University financial practices on the everyday administration of higher learning. They must ' make the needs of students and faculty members at the micro-level imperative, before the next budget crisis puts the recent decline beyond recovery."
217,Latino studies teach-in held,13 November 1995,"By JEFFERY MAYS Spectator Staff WriterIn the continuing effort to establish a Latino Studies major at Columbia, approximately 30 students attended a teachin on Saturday in Ferris Booth Hall, featuring speakers from universities with similar programs already in place. Joshua Rosenthal, a graduate student in history, said he organized the teach-in after talking with several undergraduates who expressed concern at the lack of a Latino Studies major. While the Latin American Studies major was incorporated into the Spanish and Portuguese Department last May, a Latino Studies major, which would concentrate on""the history of Latino immigrants in the United States as well as the people that were here before the U.S. was formed,"" still does not exist at Columbia, Rosenthal said. Jean Franco, former director of the Institute for Latin American and Iberian studies, said the University is not moving toward a Latino Studies major because Columbia is too conservative. ""Columbia is in a very dangerous state of stagnation,"" said Franco, who served as the director from 1984-6. Franco said the University's structure is not favorable to democratic means of bringing about change, because the provost and the deans wield a tremendous amount of power while departmental chairs are caught somewhere in between.""I was pretty frustrated when I was director. It was very difficult to get an interdisciplinary program going,"" Franco said. ""The issue of Latino studies at Columbia is tied into the larger issue of making Columbia into an institute where there is real democracy,"" Franco added. Juno Diaz, a student at Cornell University, said administrators implemented an improved Latino Studies program in November 1993 after students took over the school's main administrative building. Students took action after a Latino art show was vandalized with ethnic slurs. After the takeover, Diaz said three interdisciplinary professors were hired to teach Latino courses immediately and two interdisciplinary professors were hired the following academic year. Diaz said the gains were made as a result of the approximately 500 persistent students involved in the push to obtain a program. ""Students were like pit bulls, they were just grabbing on and not letting go,"" Diaz said. Diaz said a continuing dialogue about the need for a new Latino Studies program, along with undergraduate and graduate cooperation, media exposure, and communication with the faculty at other universities that have Latino studies departments, are crucial elements to generating support for a new program. ""At least once a month you should have meetings to say why we should have Latino studies or how we can burn down the school if we don't get it,"" Diaz said. The actual configuration of a Latino Studies program was a topic of debate at the teach-in. Several speakers said Latino studies deserved its own major, but should be attached to a larger Latin American Studies program or another discipline. Other speakers said Latino studies should be a totally independent program. Director for the Center for Puerto RicanStudies at Hunter College Juan Flores said the danger of having an independent Latino Studies program lies in the possibility that it will be subject to budget cuts in its earlier, weaker stages. For a Latino Studies program to be successful, Flores said flexibility on the issue of independence is a must. ""Being out there on your own, a limb, you will be the first to be chopped off,"" Flores said. Diaz disagreed with Flores, saying that being attached to a department is one way universities diminish the importance of Latino studies. ""Our studies are always subordinated,"" Diaz said. ""When they try to attach Latino studies to Latin American studies, what they are saying is that there can't be a U.S. Latino Studies program without Latin American Studies beings twice as big."" Tomio Geron, CC '96, vice chair of the Asian American Alliance, which has been fighting to get an Asian American Studies program at Columbia, said grouping ethnic studies programs under certain disciplines can be dangerous. For example, Geron said grouping Asian American studies or Latino studies under American studies would harm both programs. ""When the faculty says they are going to group Latino and Asian studies under American studies, they mean European American studies,"" Geron said. Franco said that if Columbia ever decided to implement a Latino Studies major, it would be a step by step process where classes and faculty would be slowly added. In the meantime, Ant Dopica, a graduate student in the English and Comparative Literature department, said students can still learn about Latino studies using their own initiative. ""Don't feel like because there is no Latino Studies program that 'I can't do it.' Use your history paper or Literature Humanities paperto do the research that will help make you an authority on the subject. Being able to speak authoritatively on an issue is very important in an academic setting,"" Dopica said. Rosenthal said Columbia is losing credibility by not implementing a Latino Studies program because it is situated in New York City, home to one of the largest Latinopopulations in the world. ""I think it's really embarrassing that Columbia pretends to be the premier institution of higher learning in New York City when smaller institutions are on the cutting edge of Latino studies. These institutions don't have the resources that we do, but they are way ahead of us,"" Rosenthal said."
218,RUNAWAYS INVADE COLUMBIA,16 November 1995,"By DEEPA VORAImagine the average senior in college about to make his debut as a director: picture the nail biting, the tantrum-throwing, the apprehension about whether anything will go according to plan. Now imagine Darrin Katz, a Columbia College senior, donninga pleasant smile, sitting comfortably on the floor amidst a flurry of activity, and answering with confidence the barrage of questions being fired at him. The pictures do notseem to mesh but, in fact, Katz will be making his directorial debut this weekend, presenting a slightly altered version of Elizabeth Swados' musical-play, Runaways. Runaways, originally produced on Broadway in 1978, is a collection of monologues and songs dealing with teenagers who have left home and opted for life on the streets. With a spectrum of characters that includes a pimp, two prostitutes, a young couple, and a deaf woman, both the stories told and the people depicted are diverse, intriguing, and multifaceted. Indeed, the script of Runaways calls for three characters who are fluent in Spanish and one who has a knowledge of sign language; in addition, for the play to have an authentic feel, teenagers of various ethnicities need to be represented. Runaways, without a doubt, is fresh in its insight and ambitious in terms of its subject material. Yet, it is not the sort of play usually found on college campuses, where one is unlikely to encounter a runaway teenager in their Literature Humanities class. When asked about this problem, Katz explained that although the play concerns a situation that college students do not usually encounter, the overall message is something with which everyone should identify. ""At its core,"" Katz said, ""Runaways, or at least our version of it, is about taking control of your life. It'sabout getting over the feelings of being victimized and making a transition so that you can see the future, so that you can change what you don't like as opposed to passively watching it."" The minimalist nature of Runaways is what most appeals toits director. The set of the play entails a couple of crates, the costuming consists of blue jeans and T-shirts, and the dialogue consists of very little formal plot structure. Katz, with passionate honesty, said that this dearth of formal theatrical tools aids in focusing the audience's mind on the rich material. In addition, Katzexplained that ""I was frustrated because it seemed like all highquality theater implied the necessity of a gigantic budget... something that we just did not have. With Runaways, though, I saw the chance to produce a gripping, distinctive performance withoutspending tons of money; it is the material and the emotion that it induces which holds the place of importance in this show, not fancy costumes or elaborate scenery."" In addition to the dialogue, the play's success also relies on the melodies—which, luckily, are mood-affecting and meritori-ous. The chilling emotionally barren voices of the cast members are enough of a reason to see this play; indeed, if music that sends shivers down the back at one moment, and that causes laughter with a touch of sadness the next sounds tempting, this is an ideal play to see. Particularly melancholy and full of impact is the director's favorite song, ""Every Now and Then."" Containing lines such as ""Don't always condemn the one who goes ... I'm sorry,"" and ""Every time I look back, I have regrets,"" this piece serves as a window into the true feelings and mentality of a runaway teenager.Runaways is not a polished, glittery, Broadway-esque play; one who can only appreciate high-budgeted Broadway productions would probably want to skip this piece. Instead, it is realistic, somber, and, at times, incredibly disturbing. Indeed, at a dramatic peak of the play, one of the prostitute characters is killed and before the blood on her body has dried, another one of the runaways is searching the girl's pockets for whatever money she may have had. In another scene, with equal amounts of depressing realism, a pimp, remembering his childhood in a less-than-caring orphanage, says that ""Now, I'm in the orphanage for grown ups: the world."""
219,Editorial The Class of Columbia,20 November 1995,"The Class of ColumbiaThe University's drive to expand incrementally the number of students entering Columbia College each year under the guise of increasing revenue and making undergraduate education more visible ignores one of the school's main attractions: its size. The administration cites several justifications for enlarging the class size, but none will compensate for the detrimental effects that such increases inevitably bring. The University is preparing to re-, lease a feasibility study promoting an increase in class size, claiming that such a move will improve the quality of student life at Columbia. While University administrators insist that quantity will be served by quality, Columbia remains unable to accommodate its current students. It seems unlikely that Columbia's facilities and resources will improve enough to accommodate a larger student body in the future. Two of Columbia's endearing features are small classes and a low student-faculty ratio. As the University does not plan to increase faculty sizeto meet the demands of a larger student body, the quality of classes will necessarily decline as individual course sizes increase and professors lose touch with their charges. Another of Columbia's attractions is the Core Curriculum: a required course of study important not only for the material covered, but for the method of instruction. Small Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization sections are open forums for student dialogue. University Provost Jonathan Cole reassures students that more sections would be created to handle more students, but without a concomitant increase in faculty, Core classes will flounder as graduate students and other less-qualified proctors begin teaching additional sections —if these sections are created at all. To maintain the current caliber of students, Columbia would have to increase and strengthen its applicant pool. The administration's dedication to quality will prove hollow if the acuity and diversity of the student body is not guaranteed. The University'sclaim that increases in class size would bring additional revenue from tuition contradicts such a promise. By depending on tuition for revenue, the University has reason not to accept students who need financial aid, further endangering need-blind and fullneed admissions policies. Instead of expanding the alumni base for contributions, the University should focus on improving the satisfaction of future alumni. The limited funds derived from alumni donations result from poor student services, not from a lack of possible contributors. With the smallest undergraduate student body in the Ivy League, Columbia gives its students the opportunity to live within a small community amid the larger context of New York City. No increase in revenue could make up for the loss of Columbia's character. The current study was designed to validate some administrators' long-standing assumptions, which should have been evaluated according to more than merely fiduciary con-cerns"
220,Graduate students play larger role in CC Faculty interest questioned,27 November 1995,"Faculty interest questionedBy DIANE VADINO Spectator Staff WriterAccording to the Columbia College Bulletin, ""the Core Curriculum is Columbia's signature, its intellectual coat of arms""—and as the first Core class, dating from 1919, Contemporary Civilization, a year-long required class for all Columbia College students, is considered ""one of its most valuable assets."" Today, however, a variety of factors have altered the once-preferred ratios of graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty, with graduate students making up a considerable portion of those teaching CC. According to Director of Contemporary Civilization and Queen Wilhelmina Professor of History J. W. Smit, the teaching responsibilities for CC have traditionally been divided evenly between graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty. However, both Smit and Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis said CC graduate student preceptors now represent a percentage ""somewhere in the mid--405."" Yatrakis said the proportion of graduatestudent preceptors in Literature Humanities classes is closer to the original ratio, and added that the teaching divisions of MusicHumanities and Art Humanities classes, which are staffed by members of the Music and Art History Departments, were never intended to mimic the one-third ratios devised for CC and Lit Hum. Smit said that while he considers thepercentage of graduate student preceptors to be too high, he said he recognizes their justified and traditional place within the CC teaching staff. ""The situation has gotten out of hand now, but I would not like to be without [graduate student preceptors],"" Smit said. ""They really are a very important part of the staff and should remain so, but at the moment, the proportions are wrong."" Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley also defended the role of graduate students teaching CC, noting that the Core Curriculum teaching staff has always included graduate students and that the combination of faculty members and preceptors encourages the exchange of ideas between two teaching generations, as well as -offering graduate students a highly structured environment in which to continue their own training. ""I'm never sure that simple mathematical ratios are a way of deciding an issue,"" Quigley said. ""As long as there's a significant representation of junior faculty, senior faculty, and graduate students, I'm comfortable with it."" Quigley also supported graduate student preceptors against student accusations of sloppiness and inefficiency, saying that the highly supervised nature of CC teaching positions protects against many of the problems resulting from too much independence too early in a graduate student's teaching career.""The objection frequently brought to bear against graduate student teachers is that at some institutions, graduate students are given a free-standing curriculum,"" with the ability to establish the syllabus and grading criteria individually, Quigley said. ""The other objection is that [graduate students at other institutions] are asked to take teaching responsibility very early in their career, as early as their second or third year. In the Core, students are teaching later in their graduate careers, very much at the point where they're just preparing to write a dissertation and go out on the job market—it's just a very different sort of situation than the one that is the target for criticism at other institutions."" According to Smit, the reasons for the number of graduate students teaching CC are based on several factors including faculty reluctance to teach the class, which requires faculty members to be familiar with several different disciplines—including philosophy, history, and political science—unlike Lit Hum, which is based primarily on the study of literature. ""That's the most important reason that [CC] is less attractive to senior faculty to teach than Lit Hum,"" Smit said. ""Philosophers have to deal with history, while historians have to deal with political science. For somebody from [the Middle Fast and Asian Language and Cultures department (MF.ALAC)], none of the texts in CC have anything to do with their training."" ""Somehow in Lit Hum, senior faculty have stayed in rather large quantities. In Lit Hum, people can continue basically to teach their own discipline—once trained in F.nglish literature, it's not a big step to teach classic literature,"" Smit said. ""You don't have to really retool [to teach Lit Hum]; it's a much bigger step for an American historian to be teaching CC, which is all about texts which in his training hardly played a role,"" he added. Yatrakis echoed Smit's thoughts, adding that the far-reaching nature of the class, which covers works from Plato's ""Republic"" to a number of more current works, often intimidates faculty members who are completely comfortable in one discipline. ""We don't expect them to be experts in socio-political thought from ancient times tothe present,"" she added, ""but we do know that they can be intellectual guides for students as they engage these important works and ideas."" Additionally, Smit said faculty members who are recruited as senior professors are especially reluctant to teach a broad-based course such as CC. And while assistant professors receive a semester off after teaching the class for three years, senior faculty ""don't get anything special for it,"" Smit said. ""People who don't have the CC tradition behind them basically avoid teaching it,"" Smit said. ""Departments have a habit of hiring people to cover certain specialties, and a well-known specialist hired as a senior professor generally doesn't like to give up time doing his own stuff for doing something outside his discipline."" Another reason Smit pointed to in explaining the disproportionate number of graduate students teaching the course is the decreasing size of the faculty and a need for individual departments to retain their own teaching staffs. ""Faculties are still shrinking, and the understandable complaint of departments is that they cannot cover the classes in their department,"" Smit said. ""When I teach CC, I can't teach a seminar or lecture in my own discipline, and a department does not like to lose 50 percent of its teachers to courses outside the department. I don't think at this moment in time of shrinking faculties, [department] chairmen can continue to give more regular faculty to the Core program."" Smit said the possibility of a larger Columbia College class size, currently being examined by the provost's office, could irreparably damage the nature of the class and result in less effective teaching. More CC sections would be necessary to accommodate the extra students, Smit said, and as a result, graduate students who, in the past, would have been turned down for a teaching position, would now be accepted. ""On one hand the faculty is shrinking, and on the other hand, you have the increased size of the College, which means you need more sections of Lit Hum, CC, and the other Core classes,"" Smit said. ""It's really a contradictory policy."" Smit also noted that the changing natureof several disciplines, which had in the past contributed faculty members to CC, resulted in a situation where entire departments no longer contribute instructors to CC. ""Certain departments [such as economics and anthropology] have totally dropped out of teaching CC,"" Smit said. ""In econ, the reason's that difficult—economics has become more and more a mathematical science, while before it had been a social science with a very strong humanities aspect. All these things are changing back, but we have not yet seen the departments return to CC,"" he added. Several Core administrators emphasized that although graduate students comprise a higher proportion of the teaching staff than originally intended, graduate students have always represented a part of the teaching staff. The extensive training they receive, Smit said, as well as their enthusiasm for teaching, can in some cases render them preferable to a tenured faculty member who has grown tired of the subject, while Yatrakis noted that one of the University's most acclaimed professors, Lionel Trilling, taught CC as an instructor before becoming a full faculty member. To prepare graduate students for teaching CC, Smit said, the selected students go through an extensive training process and participate in staff meetings throughout their tenure as preceptors. According to Smit, those chosen to teach CC sections are gradually subjected to a substantive training process, which includes exposure to a CC class prior to their teaching appointment, additional meeting time for first-year preceptors, and attendance at a weekly staff meeting, at which all CC teachers gather together to discuss the upcoming works. James Steintrager, who is finishing his dissertation in comparative literature, is teaching a CC section for the first time this year. ""One of the biggest problems is that no one can be an expert on all the material in this class,"" Steintrager said. ""We have to know more than just what we're reading, [such as] an idea of how Plato's ""Republic"" fits in with all of Plato's work. In some ways, the training is always going to be inadequate because CC, as opposed to Lit Hum, is nevergoing to be standardized. Not only do you have to make some difficult choices witli the reading [selections], there's many more choices with which themes you want to focus on."" According to Steintrager, preceptors are motivated to dedicate considerable amounts of energy and work developing the class, if only to put to rest undergraduate students' concerns that their status as graduate students diminishes their teaching. ""I always have this fear in the back of my mind,"" Steintrager said. ""Students expect you to be a little more humane, but on the other hand, they do tend to be a little bit more critical of what your credentials are for teaching. You may find that grad students overcompensate for this, something which could really add to the course. Grad students aren't resting on their laurels, because they really don't have any."" Steintrager said he disagrees with the idea that faculty-led classes are inherently more successful than those led by graduate students. ""Ultimately, I don't know how well that holds up,"" Steintrager said. ""Teaching CC requires more energy and time commitment than it does expertise in a given field."" Although one student who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he has had positive experiences with graduate students teaching his other Core classes, his experience with a graduate student teaching CC has been considerably less fulfilling. ""I feel like I'm being robbed educationally because my grad student CC professor is such a disorganized teacher. Although he himself knows the material reasonably well, he has little pedagogical skills,"" said the student. ""I've given him plenty of chances, yet every time I feel that he's failed at effectively handling a text or conveying an idea."" The student also said the experience has affected his perception of graduate student teachers in general and would influence who he selected to teach his CC class in the spring. ""After over a year here, I feel I have no contact with any professors as well as no academic direction,"" he said. ""Next semester I'm choosing a section on behalf of the status of the professor that's teaching it,""the student added."
221,"Faculty members discuss role of teaching, research",4 December 1995,"By DIANE VADINO Spectator Staff WriterUniversity professors face a variety of demands on their time; myriad responsibilities—ranging from publishing to research to teaching—are expected of all faculty members. Despite a widespread belief that research and teaching at a university must compete with each other for attention, several professors argue that the two often complement one another. Professor of English and Comparative Literature and former Associate Dean of Columbia College Michael Rosenthal said that at Columbia, most professors are able to balance both teaching and research, adding that the research a professor conducts often results in new perspectives that can be presented in the classroom. Professor of Religion Wayne Proudfoot also criticized the belief that the most successful publishers are often poor teachers. ""Those people who are the best teachers are not necessarily those who publish the least —in fact, it's often the opposite,"" Proudfoot said. ""It often influences teaching positively."" Brander Matthews Professor of Dramatic Literature and former Vice President for Arts and Sciences Martin Meisel said professors who are active in research and publishing bring the enthusiasm they have fortheir focus into the classroom. ""The two go hand in hand. If you're excited about an idea you're having, you're likely to be excited about that idea in the classroom,"" Meisel said. Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature and former director of the Literature Humanities Program James Mirollo, who will retire-from full-time teaching at the end of the fall term, said he believes that time spent performing research directly benefits a professor's teaching ability. ""Despite my reputation for teaching, I have never seen a conflict between the two,"" said Mirollo, who won the Mark Van Doren award last April. ""I can't imagine being a good teacher without constant research; most of us do a good deal of study of texts that we teach—stuff we should know anyway. It all fits together very nicely."" However, in describing what he called the ""basic university culture"" of which Columbia is a part, Rosenthal stressed that quality research is not only measured more easily than teaching, but also is more often rewarded than teaching, through higher standings in ""ludicrous"" surveys such as that published by U.S. News and World Report. ""The basic university culture throughout all American research universities is that rewards are based more heavily on research than onteaching,"" Rosenthal said. ""What [those reports] come down to is 'Do we know who your stars are?""' Rosenthal said. Proudfoot stressed that publishing credentials are not the only requisite for promotion, and that candidates must demonstrate success in both arenas. ""Certainly with someone who comes up for tenure, one would need to have a very solid basis in research, but that's not sufficient,"" Proudfoot said. ""They also have to be very good teachers."" Jacques Barzun Professor andChair of the Department of History Kenneth T. Jackson said that tenure decisions are beginning to reveal a tendency toward valuing teaching skills. ""Tenure promotion is beginning to show that teaching is more important, and that undergraduate teaching is especially vital to an institution,"" Jackson said. ""It's never been bad at Columbia, but given all the problems, I think we've done a pretty good job."" Jackson, whose main area of research is urban history, said the history department maintains a tra-dition of excellent teaching. ""I think the history department is fortunate in that it lias a number of people who are excellent teachers,"" Jackson said. ""This department has a tradition which values teaching, as well as a tradition of excellent teachers, and because of that we have a large number of people in our classes."" Jackson said some institutions will attempt to lure successful researchers from schools such as Columbia, and promise them that ifthey teach at their institution, they can focus solely on research without any of the added weight of teaching. t ""We don't make these kinds of compromises,"" Jackson said. ""Everybody in our department is a teacher, and we like to think that everybody is good at it. Here, more than at other places, we think it's true,"" he added. Professor of Astronomy James Applegate said he sees an important relationship between teaching and research. ""There's even a feeling that research ability and teaching ability are mutually exclusive,"" Applegate said. ""My experience is that they're corollary; people who are good at one are usually good at the other. There's a lot of synergy between teaching and research."" ""Most people take teaching seriously. Certainly there are professors here who try to put as little time and energy into teaching as humanly possible, who try to avoid teaching whenever they can,"" Applegate said. ""You will not find the opposite, because those people don't get tenured."" Jackson, who was on sabbatical last year, said he values his work in teaching and would not accept a position that would not allow him to continue to do so. ""If you told me I could have some job and never teach for the rest of my life, that would not be what I think I'm about; the idea of working in a think tank—doing your research [without teaching] is not the most desirable outcome, and I feel most of my colleagues would feel the same way,"" Jackson said. ""What you do with students does take a certain amount of energy, and I don't think you should skimp on that. Most of us try to strike a balance between the two. If I have to choose, I prefer to give more time to students because that's what I'm being paid for, andthat's what I enjoy,"" Mirollo said. Applegate said most professors begin teaching without any formal introduction to the skills of teaching. ""You can be a brilliant astronomer, but you might not make much noise,"" Applegate said, adding that the proposed Teaching Resource Center could work to provide new professors with the skills —such as public speaking skills—that they lack at the beginning of their academic careers. Mirollo said tenure decisions should place serious weight on exemplary teaching skills. ""If someone is a terrific teacher, maybe one good book and teaching is enough, and we don't have to ask for'two good books,"" Mirollo said, adding that he feels most professors do their best work—both as teachers and as researchers—after being awarded tenure. Applegate also said professors who are active in ongoing research can offer students the benefits of the most recent information available. ""You probably don't want to take a class in 1995 with someone who got a Ph.D. in 1970 because what you're learning is reflective of what he remembers from 1970,"" Applegate said. ""Astronomy is a field that moves relatively quickly, which changes every six months."" Additionally, Applegate said many professors wish they could dedicate more time to their teaching. ""Many professors are frustrated that they can't teach more,"" Applegate said. ""A major point of frustration is the time spent working to raise money through grants [and other avenues]; we'd rather spend more time in classroom."" ""I feel there's a proper balance for the two, between time spent alone with your nose poked in a book and time spent in a classroom sharing information with your students,"" Mirollo said."
222,Report on class size presented to faculty,18 January 1996,"By KIM VAN DUZER Spectator Staff WriterIn an oral report presented to selected faculty members on Dec. 19, a panel of administrators led by University Provost Jonathan Cole presented the preliminary a feasibility study on the effects of increasing the size of Columbia College. The study, entitled ""Enhancing the Quality of Undergraduate Education at Columbia: An Assessment and Feasibility Study,"" examined various models of the costs and benefits of increasing the size of undergraduate programs. It is the result of an initiative by University President George Rupp to move undergraduate education to the center of the University, according to Director of Planning and Institutional Research Marian Pagano. ""The goal of the report was to determine how we make the whole undergraduate experience here better,"" Pagano said. We wanted to bounce our ideas off of some smart people and see where the holes were, and [faculty members] were very helpful inthat respect."" According to Cole, the report was addressed to the Executive Committee of the faculty of the Arts and Sciences construct and the faculty chairs of the Arts and Sciences construct. The Arts and Sciences construct consists of the School of Arts, Columbia College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of International and Public Affairs, and the School of General Studies. Additionally, there will be a series of presentations in the upcoming weeks to familiarize students, faculty members and alumni with the results of the study. ""The presentations will give people an opportunity to react and give feedback, and then we'll be able to modify the report in response to those reactions,"" Cole said. Pagano stressed that fundamental components of the undergraduate program, such as need blind admissions and the core cur-riculum, would remain intact regardless of an increase in size. Adlai E. Stevenson Professor of International Politics and former Acting Associate Vice President for Planning in Arts and Sciences Robert Jervis headed a group of staff members working on the study. Jervis said an increase in size would affect each department differently, depending on the size of classes and the popularity of the department. ""If you look at the Core, for something like Logic and Rhetoric we would just have to add more sections,"" Jervis said. ""With something like Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, these classes are a little under-enrolled, so it's just a matter of filling each section to capacity."" Chair of the Chemistry Department Professor George Flynn, who was part of the Committee that heard the report, said the increase would not have a large effect on the Chemistry Department if it was accompanied by an increase in faculty. ""With labs, it's just a matter of increasing the number of sections, and with the large lecture classes, a 10-15 percent increase won't make much of a difference,"" Flynn said. Flynn also said an increase in class size would have an important impact on the undergraduate program in the University. ""The larger the college, the more influence it will have in the University, and I think that it is basically a good thing,"" Flynn said. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Michael Rosenthal said an increase in the size of the College would make things more difficult in departments with heavy enrollments such as English, and alleged that the size of the College has already increasednoticeably in recent years. ""I am concerned that an increase in the size of the College is not going to be matched by an increase in faculty and resources,"" said Rosenthal, ""but the little known fact is that the college has increased 25 percent over the past six years, and it seems to me that's a fact that should surface in this discussion."" Despite the possibility of increased class sizes, Chair of English and Comparative Literature department Professor Michael Seidel said he felt the presentation of the report was well-received by faculty members. ""I think everyone is good-willed about this,"" Seidel said. ""The intent of the administration right now is certainly to enhance undergraduate departments, not weaken them, and there is generally a feeling that the faculty would cooperate with an increase and try to make it work."" Though students have not formally heard the results of the study, many fear that an increase in the size of the College will have a negative effect on the quality of undergraduate education. Miguel Amador, CC '99, voiced concern that an increase in students would not be matched by an increase in the number of sections for Core classes. ""I would only support an increase in the size of the College if an increase in the number of sections for Core classes comes with it,"" Amador said. But Laura Griffith, CC '9B, said an increase in the size of the College would have widespread negative effects on the quality of undergraduate life. ""I really don't think they can handle the amount of students they have now,"" Griffith said. ""The bureaucracy here is hard enough to deal with as it is - with more students it will only get worse.""Director of Planning and Project Development at Columbia presents drawings of the University's building projects at a meeting last night."
223,New report to reconsider two irreconcilables,25 January 1996,"SCOTT MacKENZIEBleachUniversity Provost Jonathan Cole's longawaited report on the feasibility of increasing the size of Columbia College, delivered to faculty members in December, appears to confirm what students know and fear: the University's undergraduate population is expanding and will continue to grow. Despite the efforts of the administration to withhold the study from public scrutiny until the latest date, general impressions and discreet sources indicate the report does not depart from existing policy in any meaningful way, and leaves those concerns important to students unaddressed. The current administration made the expansion of the College a guiding priority as University President George Rupp assumed office in 1993- Among the first documents to land on his desk was the final report ofColumbia's Strategic Planning Commission, convened to recommend policies and goals the University might achieve by the year 2000. The group was chaired by (surprise, surprise) Provost Cole, and put forward a variety of proposals. Initiatives advocating fundamental change to the Core Curriculum (remember those wonderful Music Humanities experimental sections), and rejecting the notion of new programs outside the existing departments (ever ponder the University's refusal to create Ethnic Studies programs) originated here. The commission's final report introduced the idea to expand the school, and linked it to the notion of generating a greater focus on undergraduate education. Rupp then touched on the importance of Columbia College to the University constructin his inaugural address, although he wisely failed to mention the projected expansion. His decision was a wise one, I think, because the student body recognized then and realizes now that an increased number of students does not suggest greater quality in education. While administrators remain committed to the idea, students regard their school in different terms. Resources preoccupy—the last few rounds of budget cuts crippled several departments and programs we care about. The everyday experience of many students consists of war-story depic-tion of housing shortages, overcrowded or locked-out classes, and increased bureaucratic hassle. As the Strategic Planning Commission gave way to other short-lived enterprises, administrators publicly began consideration of a 15 percent increase in Columbia College class size. A study completed in 1994, structurally similar to the one presented to faculty members in December, attached three main conditions: Improvements to Columbia's library and physical fitness facilities, construction of additional residence halls, and, most importantly, the maintenance of the selectivity of Columbia College. Administrative policy has since directed efforts toward satisfying the proscribed requirements. The University recently completed renovations to the gym; ambitious programs for Butler await sufficient funding. Columbia plans to erect a large dormitory in the immediate future —on hold because of community protest (it seems the University's up to its old tricks). The administration worked hard to increase the applicant pool and the recent influx of new students in recent years hasn't affected the acceptance rates and SAT averages administrators really care about. Students, however, do not celebrate these efforts. The importance of the 1994 study lies in the omissions, not the inclusions. No conditions to preserve the integrity of the Core Curriculum. No contingency plans to deal with possible effects on need-blind admissions policy. No steps to alleviate the additional burden to existing departments. In short, the report failed to recommend the increase in resources that seems a necessary companion to any expansion scheme. So Columbia College expanded—through miscalculation, underestimation, and through secret operation by the University's high officers. Lack of foresight contributed to the disasters suffered in the past year. The University's creation of an ad hoc committee to oversee the financial aid duties of the UndergraduateOffice of Admissions, that group's enforcement of a relaxed deadline (leaving hundreds of needy students out in the cold), and the subsequent admission of students off the non-financial aid waiting list compromised Columbia's need-blind admissions policy. The scandal revealed the University's inability to satisfy the policy's demands for a larger class size. Cutting rather than expanding resources for financial aid stretched needblind to its limit; the expanded incoming class size pushed it beyond budget capacities. The administration's cynical reaction betrayed the trust of students and professors who took a pay cut several years ago to preserve the policy. The effects on class composition, especially minority enrollment, became obvious. The Arts and Sciences, specifically the Department of English and Comparative Literature became another-casualty of administrative policy. The loss of 20 percent of its faculty due to budget cuts leaves the department hard-pressed to fulfill obligations, including administration of Logic and Rhetoric and Literature Humanities sections. The stress on professors makes it difficult for undergraduate and graduate students to obtain the attention they require and allows little time for faculty contribution to a variety of programs—the gender institute and the African American studies program. The damage led the administration to temporarily abandon its squeeze play; Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen authorized three new faculty appointments for the 1996-7 year in November. This semester, the department's difficulties in coping with the increasing numbers of students is evident. Overcrowding resulted in the inability of students to enroll in the department's popular Contemporary American Fiction class. As students filled the aisles and occupied the floors of Hamilton's largest lecture room, Professor of Writing Richard Locke moved to preserve the integrity of the class, or, at least, to prevent a potential fire hazard. An alleged decree by the Committee on Instruction or some other body precipi-tated a mass exodus of freshmen, sophomores, and Barnard students. This official hierarchy for College classes, like the ad hoc committee in the admissions office is a bad policy, an emergency effort designed to cope with the unforeseen consequences of increasing class size. These instances exemplify the potential fundamental effects of the measures under consideration. Growth affects every facet of the community and demands a degree of consideration the administration's practices have so far lacked. It's not a solution to Columbia's financial woes. Through these studies, the provost and other official optimists endeavor to convince us that the combination of the largest budget cuts to the Arts and Sciences in the history of the University and one of the largest increases to class size in recent memory has not and will not lead to certain disaster. According to Cole, the two lead magically to the enhancement of undergraduate education at Columbia—a phrasestudents, weary from the above deseribed events, cannot trust. I'm told the newest feasibility study, euphemistically entitled ""Enhancing the Quality of Undergraduate Education at Columbia,"" reaffirms the importance of the Core Curriculum and need-blind admissions —in word. It assumes expansion is feasible without ""appreciable effect on the learning environment,"" a point argued over and over by Cole. Without the commitment of additional resources, rapid expansion of Columbia College will continue in abject failure. Professors seemed resigned to the results of the report, not enthusiastic. That suggests to me current trends will continue. In terms of improving the quality of the educational opportunities offered by the College, increased class size has proved a bankrupt policy characterized by repeated catastrophe, and will undermine the ability of the University to live up to its lofty responsibilities.Scott MacKenzie, CC '96, whitens whites on alternate Thursdays in Spectrum."
224,University should reconsider Barnard's status,16 February 1996,"CHARLES SISKReckoningsThe time has come for Columbia University to reevaluate its relationship with Barnard College. The partnership between the two schools is an obsolete vestige of a time when Columbia was only open to upper-class white males. As the University moves beyond this period in its history, it should consider the role that Barnard plays as a college within the University and question whether supporting a single-sex college is really in its best interests. The role of Barnard, traditionally, was to give intelligent women the opportunity toattend Columbia University. The University stoppedneeding Barnard College to fulfill this goal when Columbia Col- / lege first admitted ' women in the early 1 1980's. Many other uni-versities also supported women's colleges, but ei-ther combined them with other colleges or absorbed them when they started admit-ting women. A good example of \ this is Harvard University and Radcliffe College, which became1 Harvard/Radcliffe after Harvard began 1 allowing women to enroll. When Colum-bia became coed, for some reason it did not follow suit; now, 15 years later, administrators should ask why."
225,Faculty react to planned increase Professors divided over effects of increase in Columbia College,19 February 1996,"Professors divided over effects of increase in Columbia CollegeBy ADRIENNE CARTER Spectator Staff WriterThe debate over the proposed increase in the size of Columbia College is being waged throughout all segments of the University, from students to administrators to staff members. One of the groups that will be most affected by the planned additions is the faculty—many of whom were divided on the ramifications of the increase. According to the report, entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia,"" University administrators have proposed increasing the size of Columbia College from 3,500 students to approximately 4,000 by 2002. Assistant Director of AfricanAmerican Studies Curtis Stokes said the increase will negatively affectthe undergraduate experience at Columbia College and in the end, students will feel the greatest consequences. ""I am disturbed because my understanding is that Columbia College is committed to academic excellence and implicit in academic excellence is the idea that students should be a priority. That is undermined when the size of the class is significantly increased,"" Stokes said. ""One has to certainly, as an instructor, be concerned about what the future holds for the students."" However, Chair of the Physics Department Professor of Physics Norman Christ said he is enthusiastic about the prospects of the increase, saying it will allow the physics department to do more in way of scientific research. ""I think most of the science department, certainly physics is small compared to other departments at competing universities. Anything that goes in the direction of going larger is of benefit to the University,"" Christ said. ""In general, it's better to get bigger than smaller."" The report concluded that in order to maintain the size of lim-ited-enrollment Core classes —including Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Logic and Rhetoric classes—an additional 42 sections would be necessary. According to the report, lecturecourses in the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities will be the least affected by the increase because of the high registration already in those classes. However, there will be some increases to various classes, but the affect of this increase varies, according to Columbia College faculty members. Chair of the Anthropology Department Alexander Alland Jr. said the anthropology department will not feel the effects of an increase in the class size. ""I don't think it will affect the [anthropology department]. Our classes have always ranged from small to large depending on the entry level,"" Alland said. Chair of the Sociology Department Mary Ruggie said the increase in the number of students will affect classes in different ways. For instance, she said, with larger classes that have over 75 people the effect will be great if there aren't enough discussion sections. ""We already have a couple of classes that are really large. If you can't have extra discussion classes, they won't have'as good of an experience,"" Ruggie said. ""When [the classes] get to be too big, there isn't as much discussion."" However, she said, classes with only 50 people will not be affected as much ""if there are just.minimal increases. Chair of the Religion Department Wayne Proudfoot said classes in the religion department are already too large and the size increase will only add to the problem. ""Some of our classes are too large already because of the Major Cultures requirement,"" Proudfoot said„ With the increase in class size for Columbia College and the possible effect on various courses, faculty members agreed that additional resources in most departments will be necessary to facilitatethe increase. However, professors were split over whether or not the administration will parallel the increase in students with an increase in resources. Higgins Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Chemistry Department George Flynn said the administration has proposed an increase in labs as well as teaching assistants in order to deal with an increased students load in the chemistry department. ""The incremental costs have been calculated quite well,"" Flynn said. ""Nobody is trying to pull a fast one with regards to budgetary calculations."" Similarly, Alland said his department will be able to handle an increase because there were already plans in motion to hire new faculty members before the announcement. ""We're recruiting faculty. [The increase in faculty] depends on who we get, but it's a very significant number,"" Alland said. ""We're hoping to have these people in place by next year."" Christ said he believes added resources—such as labs and discussion sections —are needed, but the current faculty will be able to handle extra students. ""I think there is enough flexibil-ity [in the physics faculty] that we can deal with a 10 percent increase [in students] without too much increase in faculty,"" Christ said. However, Proudfoot said he was unsure of whether there will be sufficient support systems to handle the extra students. ""It can't be done without the resources,"" Proudfoot said. ""The report from the administration says resources will be made available, but it's not really quite clear [what those resources will be] right now."" Proudfoot added that hiring additional teaching assistants is especially crucial in light of the new proposal. ""It's very hard to teach it in the proper way if we don't have enough teaching assistants,"" Proudfoot said. Ruggie is similarly unsure if the current resources are enough to deal with the extra students ""What we would like to do is have more discussion sections,"" Ruggie said. Ruggie also said an increase in professors would help make the students' experience in the sociology department a better one. ""We wish there were going be more professors; we're just not sure that's going to happen,"" Ruggie said."
226,"Cole, Quigley, and Cohen present plan Cole says plans to close River Hall are now 'off-line'",28 February 1996,"Cole says plans to close River Hall are now 'off-line'By ADRIENNE CARTER Spectator Staff WriterWith only a month a half until Columbia College admissions officials mail out acceptance letters, University administrators say the size of the Class of 2000 has yet to be determined, as the debate over class size continues among students, administrators, faculty, and staff members within the University. University Provost Jonathan Cole released a letter to the faculty on Monday addressing numerous issues and questions that have been ""raised repeatedly"" over the course of the class size debate. Cole, Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley, and Vice President for Arts and Science David Cohen also addressed various concerns at a presentation to an audience of approximately 10 students. In the original report entitled ""Enhancing the Undergraduate Experience at Columbia"" released by the University at the end of January, administrators proposed a 15 percent increase in class size—a total of 530 additional students—by the year 2000. The report also called for the closing of River Hall, the construction of a new 420-bed residence hall, and the creation of 42 new sections of limited enrollment Core classes such as Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Logic and Rhetoric. However, after the concerns offaculty members, students, and alumni became evident in committee meetings, town meetings, and other venues, the administration, according to the faculty letter, has ""learned a great deal and have also been able to articulate more fully the benefits and risks associated"" with the proposed class size increase. One of the main concerns of the student body voiced in various meetings has been the closing of RiverHall. River, which was originally slated to be closed down because it was, according to the original report, ""a poor quality facility that probably does not merit further capital investments,"" was the subject of a study conducted by engineers that was influential in determining the status of the residence hall last year. However, in the Monday meeting with students Cole said plans to take River Hall ""offline"" are being reconsidered. ""We're now going to take another look,"" Cole said. This change is due in large part, Cole said, to the reaction of the students. According to Cole, plans are in the works for another engineering study as well as a look intohow River's closing will affect the ""sense of community."" ""Although cost will be an important factor in the University's ultimate decision regarding River —including the opportunity cost of not being able to undertake improvements in other buildings—students' sentiments regarding this facility will also be fully heard and taken into account,"" Cole said in the letter to the faculty. Students and faculty were also concerned about the effects the proposed increase would have on the Core classes and instruction in various departments. While the University still plans to add 42 section of the limited enrollment Core classes, Cole said the administration has taken the necessary steps to add an additional eight instructors who will be responsible in part forteaching some core classes. Similarly, Cohen said the University ""has been moving forward""in adding more faculty to the departments in which the largest number of students major. According to Cohen, the economics department is in the process of getting five new senior hires, while the political science department hopes to bring in four new professors, and the department of English and comparative literature has been given authorization to start recruiting new faculty, Cohen said. Cohen also said the University will ""begin to manage faculty hiring,"" which would include making more professors responsible for teaching in the Core, a practice which, he added, the University has moved away from in recent years. The issue of the new residence hall was also addressed in both the faculty letter and the panel discussion. According to the letter, the decision to build a 420-bed residence hall has not yet been finalized. The decision, ""that needs to be made over the next several years,"" is contingent on two factors—""whether there are sufficient gift funds to carry out the project and whether [the University is] confident that [administrators] will proceed to the full 15 percent enlargement,"" Cole said in the letter. Even if the University decides to go ahead with the construction and then stops expanding Columbia College, Cole said in the letter, they will ""sell"" the extra beds to the School of Engineering and Applied Science or to Bar-nard. ""In the event that neither of these schools [are] interested in 'purchasing' undergraduate residence space, [the University can] transform a number of small off-campus residences nowused for undergraduates to graduate students housing,"" Cole said in the letter. Quigley similarly addressed how he hopes the plan will ""promote the further development of the house system,"" as well as foster a sense of community within the University. Quigley said that in order to further thr house system it is necessary to have a different center of social interaction. ""We would want to focus less on the dining hall and more on lounges,"" Quigley said. Quigley said the creation of social events that ""bridge"" various groups within the community including faculty and alumni are also included in the plan to increase the sense of community. For instance, Quigley said, he hopes Colum bia College administrators can make use of the ""strong alumni base"" as well as encourage students' activities in New York City. According to Cole, the Monday meeting which addressed various student and facultx concerns, is most likely the last formal meeting with students ""I don't think we'll have another meeting before we actually have to make a decision about the incoming class,"" Cole said. However, Cole urged students to continuing addressing their concerns to both the administration and student leaders.31/ur rriu 1 uviiwrntn —LX/UI mmAjrr University Provost Jonathan Cole addressed the concerns of several students at a meeting focusing on the effects of a proposed 15 percent increase in the size of Columbia College."
227,SPECTATOR PERSPECTIVES Professors say teaching should remain a priority Lectures and seminars provide different classroom experiences,27 March 1996,"Professors say teaching should remain a priorityLectures and seminars provide different classroom experiencesBy SANDRA P. ANGULO Spectator Staff WriterAlthough Columbia is not among the five Ivy League schools in the annual U.S. News and World Report listing of the top 24 schools ranked for effectiveness of undergraduate teaching [""America's Best Colleges"", Sept. 18, 1995], there are many professors who would argue that Columbia's dedication to undergraduates is evident in its commitment to maintaining the Core Curriculum and offering a variety of departmental and interdisciplinary seminars. Faculty members claim they are often unintentionally omitted from debates about expanding the class size, decreasing the number of faculty members, and overcrowding in Core classes, which have focused on the student or administrative perspective. Professors, many of whom serve on committees that help analyze and formulate University policies that affect student life, are more aware of important issues and more dedicated to the cause of bettering undergraduate education than a ranking in U.S .News and World Report can indicate. The Importance of Maintaining the Core Six professors in different fields of study unanimously asserted their belief in the benefits of teaching Core classes and mentioned the necessity of retaining strict limits on the number of students within Core sections.. Director of Contemporary Civilization Wim Smit, who has taught at Columbia for more than 30 years, said the Core is inextricable from Columbia's reputation for excellence. ""The Core is basically an education in reading and thinking about the most importantsocial issues and cultural concepts in our history,"" Smit, who has taught Contemporary Civilization, as well as Art and Music Humanities, said. ""Contemporary Civilization, for example, is not a disciplinary course but one in which the teachers as well as the students learn the basic problems and developments of social life and try to understand them through discussion."" Professor of History Marcia Wright, who also teaches Contemporary Civilization, said Core classes provide a unique opportunity for familiarity and in-depth discussion. ""While teaching the Core you can expect people to read the material and come to class prepared to discuss it,"" she said. ""It's quite a distinction from teaching a lecture in which the students don't usually speak."" While these professors enjoy teaching their respective Core classes, Smit recognized that fewer professors offer to teach the Core due to both the increasing number of professors who are on sabbatical each year and overwhelming time constraints that result from teaching in individual departments. ""In the 30 years since I've been here, the teacher-to-student ratio has become less favorable, in Core classes especially, where there are fewer professors than there used to be,"" he said. v- Hilary Ballon, Professor of Art History and Art Humanities, said that despite Columbia's low ranking in U.S. News and World Report, she considers the Core Curriculum to be an indication that undergraduate teaching is a significant issue at Columbia. ""I regard Columbia as an environment where undergraduate teaching is taken very seriously, and the Core Curriculum testifies to that,"" she said.Despite Columbia's notoriety as the smallest Ivy League school, it is common for an undergraduate to sit in at least one or two lecture courses a semester with as many as 150 to 200 other students. Professors of Columbia's larger introductory and most popular lecture courses must sometimes resort to turning students away or petitioning for an accommodating classroom. For every seemingly overcrowded lecture, however, there are also an adequate number of seminar courses that departments usually offer to juniors and seniors. All of the professors interviewed recognized the distinction between teaching behind a lectern in a classroom with over 100 students, and sitting at a table with six to 12 students in a seminar, but none of them claimed to prefer one to the other. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Franco Moretti taught at Italian universities for 19 years before moving to New York six years ago. Since then, his lecture in 20th Century Fiction has attracted more than 150 students each fall. Moretti said preparing for a lecture is an exercise in organization. ""Since I have to prepare in English, which is my second language, I have to prepare more carefully,"" he said. ""Since I don't master all of the nuances of the language, lectures get more black and white and extra clarity is inevitable."" Professor of Anthropology Terence D'Altroy, who began teaching at Columbia 14 years ago, also teaches over 150 undergraduates in his introductory course Rise of the Civilization, but heads a seminar in archeology with only 10 students. D'Altroy noted that the biggest difference between teaching a seminar and a large lecture is the requirement of student participation. ""Most students don't do all of the assignments for a lecture course —that's standard —and because of that, the upper division seminars cause students to think more than in the lower division lectures,"" D'Altroy said. ""You don't have room to deal with ambivalence in large lectures, which are more straightforward."" Like D'Altroy and Moretti, Donald Hood, Professor of Neuropsychology, teaches to more than 160 students each fall, but he also holds a 10-student seminar in his apartment called Mind and Brain, which he co-teaches with his wife, who is a neurosurgeon. ""Clearly we can't teach all of our courses to 10 students, and there is a certain order to first teaching the vocabulary of a field and then to do something more in-depth in an advanced course,"" Hood said. Moretti stressed how conciseness and spontaneity are necessary to teaching an undergraduate lecture. ""Clarity is the quality of enlightenment; if a professor is clear he establishes an equality with his students,"" he said. ""If you're not clear people can't disagree with you, which is very cozy, but it's a coziness at the expense of lack of intelligence."" On the other side of the teaching spectrum are professors who continually teach small lectures and seminars, partly because the nature of their courses is more specialized than popular introductory or survey courses. Professor of History Marcia Wright, who specializes in African History, has never taught a class to more than 50 students in her 30 years at Columbia. ""I think it is a lot better for a student to have an instructor who reads and grades all of their work instead of having it graded by a teaching assistant,"" she said. ""I don't condemn big classes, but there is something to be said for having an instructor who knows you."" Similarly, Smit teaches lecture classes to an average of 30 students and seminar classes to six or seven students. ""I've never done or taught a survey lecture course; I would hate to give one of thoselectures which are a series of informational facts,"" he said. ""Even a seminar with more than 10 students makes it much more difficult to concentrate on the issues at hand; I like a seminar in which no one is silent."" Changing Times at Columbia One of the questions that tenured professors are more qualified to answer is how undergraduates' attitudes and perceptions have changed throughout their teaching careers. Smit, who began teaching in 1965, said students are much less politically aware than they used to be in the '6os. ""I came here during a rather turbulent time when there was an active political community both on the left and the right, not just the students involved in the 'Columbia revolution,' but also their opponents,"" he said. ""In the late '7os, that began to disappear, and now I find that the majority of students are apolitical and not interested in taking a stand."" Wright agreed with Smit and said this generation of undergraduates is more cautious than the one preceding it. ""Different temperaments seem to rule at different times; this generation is very careful and has lost a whole sense of political alterna-tives that were alive and relished by the generation of the late '6os and early 705,"" Wright said. However, Hood, who began teaching at Columbia in 1969, said that, fundamentally, undergraduates students haven't stopped being politically involved. ""The number of students helping the homeless or taking a year after college to work in the public services hasn't changed,"" Hood said. ""Only the way you see mobilization on campus changes, but that is a sign of the environment in which 20-year-olds are put, not a sign of change in the 20-year-olds."" Undergraduate and Graduate Students The cross-section of professors interviewed said undergraduate teaching is a more exhilarating experience than graduate teaching, because undergraduates tend to ask more provocative questions, challenge the professor's assertions, and force the professor to offer stimulating material. Hood said it was the biggest surprise of his career to enjoy undergraduate teaching more than graduate teaching. ""I find it more enjoyable to teach undergrads because they are more open to being wrong,"" he said. ""Once people enter grad school theybecome young professionals really fast, which restricts their possibilities."" Ballon said her experience with undergraduates demonstrates how fulfilling it is to be a professor. ""It is said for every exciting discussion in an undergraduate seminar there is a graduate seminar that is stiff and more silent, because the expectations change radically,"" she said. ""Undergraduates have a much bolder approach to their educations."" The Faculty's Vision for the Future When asked about the validity of Columbia administrators' proposal to increase the class size, more than half of the professors expressed their concern that faculty resources would not increase as the number of students increases. Some of the problems highlighted by faculty members include the decrease of faculty hires in the past 10 years, the lack of adequate classroom space, and, most notably, the need to add extra Core Curriculum sections to accommodate the extra students. ""I think any kind of increase in enrollment would make it difficult to continue what I call the real Columbia education,"" Smit said. ""The Columbia education is one in which"

There was a moment of silence from my professor. The turning heads were telling. The entire class now stared anxiously at a young Asian girl who sat in the left corner of my Literature Humanities Class. It was surprising because those were the only words she had ever spoken all semester. And besides an occasional sarcastic remark from one of my sisters, or a sigh of extreme disgust and boredom from me, her words were the most that any student of color in my Literature Humanities class ever felt liberated or interested enough to say. "". . .it's on page 131,"" she said. 131, 131, 131. . I laughed. Inside, I laughed and I wondered if everyone else had caught theirony. It's been 131 years since the Emancipation Proclamation. All of the sudden, my reality became veiy intense; my identity became very painful. The class usually was just more moments of torturous racism typical of Columbia that I had to stomach. Her statement reminded me of the contradiction my presence at Columbia posed to the legacy of my ancestors' blood—the blood they shed as the victims of the insatiable thirst of the European world. Very painful. 1 realized how this God-damned place ran contrary to everything I ever hoped to represent. I wanted to lose myself, trade places with the white males who seemed to have peace of mind. I began to imagine myself in the shoes of some of the other students. I closed my eyes for a moment, and I was the slave master'sson. I coughed as my mouth filled with spit. I scrambled for a piece of tissue and I shook the vision away. Now, all eyes were on me. I excused myself to vomit. The thought of being so blind, deaf, dumb, rotten, wrong, evil, twisted, insane, out of touch, spiritless, reliant on notions of supremacy to make myself somebody, insecure and afraid, unable to analyze and think, oppressive, irrational, against nature, against God, so pitiful, so pitiful, so pitiful, so pitiful and unaware that I could sit and participate in this phenomenon called ""the Core"" of Columbia withoutrejecting it made me sick. While I was in the bathroom, I thought, ""Hell, think about it. Crazy people have peace of mind. Addicts have peace of mind. The mentally handicapped have peace of mind. And, yes, many whites have a piece of a mind. However, I've been staiggling all this time for consciousness, and not peace of mind,"" Then I looked into the mirror. I saw my reflection seeping through the words ""dick"" and ""f***"" written in magic marker. I laughed again. The irony. These European, uncivilized, perverts were trying to write over me. My African features were perverted by the marker. My African culture was perverted during slavery. My African identity was perverted through their language. My African history is perverted by their selective memories. And today, my African present is perverted through their media. I heard a ringing sound, and then I remembered the message. It was a message from a devil: ""You think you can boss people around — I'll kill you, you f***ing nigger. We're going to kill you just like we did Rabin,"" he said. When I first got this telephone message six months ago, I was afraid and ran to Columbia security for protection-—that was a joke. Looking at the reflection of myself perverted by the impact of white supremacy, I realized that my people have always survived through centuries despite white people's threats that if we did not conform they would kill us. Staring in the mirror, I began to reflect. ""You can't kill me. I am the Asiatic black man. The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet earth, the master of the universe. You can't exclude me. Lurking in your mind will always be an inferiority complex that reminds you ofEgypt and Ethiopia while you marvel after Greece. And the sad thing is that you'll he gone soon. Hell, Columbia will he gone soon. America will he gone soon. If you would listen to God, you devil, you could even save yourself."" I stared at myself in the mirror and I hegan to age. 1 noticed how differently I looked from when I had first arrived here. Now, I have changed through constantly heing black, constantly being righteous, a nation holding my tongue, and always being feared and patronized. I could barely recognize myself anymore. I stared at myself in the mirror and I felt myself being pulled into myself. I was looking in on myself. Why are you here with these devils, I wondered? I stared at myself like Jesus on the cross looking back upon his life. God, if only I could get down from here. I wanted to make sure I wasn't past tense. I wanted to make sure that I was there. 1 tried not to blink, afraid that I might lose myself again. Then all of the sudden, I wondered what happened to the marker and I stared at myself, unperverted. This perverted world is self-destructive. Revolution is the cure to the disease of whitesupremacy. If we care anything about righteousness, we must spare nothing in our efforts to destroy systems that harbor notions of white supremacy, and force them to accept the truth. The ""Core"" remains because the devil reigns. When righteous people take a stand, it will be dismantled and the devil can finally be dethroned. A rally is a rally, a petition is a petition, a sit-in is a sit-in, and a hunger strike is a hunger strike. But if we are going to eradicate the disease of white supremacy so that we can look into the mirror and see the reflection of God, then we must be willing to truly destroy the world ruled over by the perverts.

229,"Golfer Lavalle, 51, acts as mentor for team",18 April 1996,"By MIKE CAMPOLI Spectator Sports EditorThere are a number of features that separate golfer Ray Lavalle from the remainder of the Columbia student body. Unlike most of his peers on the fairways and in the classroom, for whom it seems like eons ago when the television sit-com Welcome Back Kotter was still in live production, Lavalle, 51, was born during the final years of the Second World War, and he was in his twenties by the time the Vietnam War draft got underway. During his life Lavalle has lived through numerous experiences,, such as a stint in the Marines where he earned his General Education Degree, that most at Columbia have never encountered, and he now has children old enough to be in his section of Literature Humanities. Perhaps more importantly, Lavalle is grateful for his opportunity to attend Columbia, and he has a clear idea of what he wants to accomplish with his education. Lavalle first came to the attention of the Athletic Department last spring, when he telephoned Head Coach Al Carlson and informed him that he was planning to transfer here from Rockland Community College, where he was a two-time junior college Academic All-America. He played twice in the National Junior Athletic Association championships, finishing 31st last spring. At first Carlson did not know how to react to the situation, but once he found out how good Lavalle was, and realized that he could help Columbia's team, Carlson became excited about the prospects of having him on the squad. Although Lavalle had the talent to step right onto the course for the Lions, his debut was delayed because he was not cleared to play by the National Collegiate Athletic Association until the winter. He also did not participate in the golf team's first two tournaments of the year, and did not face collegiate competition until last weekend, when he took part in the Navy Invitational at Annapolis. According to Lavalle, he has thus far been affected by the cold weather of the spring,but he anticipates improvement as the mercury rises. ""The coldness of the spring has been a difficulty for me because I have bad arthritis in my hands,"" Lavalle, who shot an 86 and an 89 in two rounds in Annapolis last week, said. ""But I think I'm where I want to be in terms of my game at this time of year.""While Lavalle has only participated in one competition thus far, he has found other ways to contribute to the team. Among these is his willingness to act as a mentor to his teammates to help them improve their golf games. ""He's definitely one of the first people I'd look to for advice on golf,"" senior co-Captain Dennis Chang said. ""I wouldn't go to him for advice on things such as the mechanics of my swing, but I would speak to him about course management and the strategy of playing a golf course."" Chang also said that Lavalle has helped his teammates learn about the mental aspects of playing golf. ""He teaches you a few things, such as how to control your expectations and your emotions,"" Chang said. ""He teaches you how to mature quicker."" This fits with the role that Lavalle envisions for himself on the team. ""I see myself as an assistant to the kids,""Lavalle said. ""Most of them have not had as much experience as I've had."" However, despite the wisdom he has gathered through his greater experience of the world, Lavalle tries to limit his comments to the realm of golf. ""Most of the fellas on the team are very free and independent thinkers. I try not to influence them except in terms of golf,"" Lavalle said. Lavalle also brings the confidence of being in a winning program in Rockland Community College, which can help both himself and the team. ""He brings success at Junior College,"" Carlson said. ""He's a winner, and that adds a lot."" ""Everyone on our team comes from a winning program,"" Chang said. ""Ray helps to bolster that and to keep it going. . . .Teams around here have a tendency to fall into that lull of losing at Columbia, so its good to have that extra energy to keep the confidence up."" His experiences at Rockland have helped Lavalle develop a confident attitude, which he hopes will characterize both his game and the games of his teammates. ""Its the only way to approach the game. You have believe in yourself and in your team, or else you'll have no chance,"" Lavalle said. Despite the generation gap that separates him from his teammates, Lavalle has been able to fit in on a squad that prides itself on its uniqueness. ""We have a very unique team,"" Carlson said. ""We're very small and close, and the guys spend a lot of time together. . . .It's a fraternity of sorts. Ray added a wrinkle to that, but he's fit in well."" ""Our team has a lot of different personalities,"" Chang said. ""We're very unique in that respect, and each person adds to it. . .Ray brings in a different perspective that I've never seen on the team. He's lived a lot and done a lot of things in his life. It's fun to have him around."" Lavalle, however, realizes that no matterhow young he feels, the age disparity between himself and his teammates separates him from them to a certain extent. ""I find it difficult to think of myself as 50 years old. I prefer to think of myself as just another member of the student body,"" Lavalle said. ""It [being on the golf team] has been somewhat of a difficult experience, because most of the guys are younger than my children. . . .I've tried to approach them as peers, and that's worked out real well."" His teammates, nonetheless, have been impressed with his attitude and his skills, and they claim that he does not fit the mold of most of the people they know who are Lavalle's age. ""Ray is an interesting individual who has experienced a great deal in life,"" co-Captain Amrit Nagpal said. ""He's not your typical 51-year-old. He's got a young take on life, and he has a young personality. He likes to joke and laugh, and he says whatever is on his mind. . . .He's the most unique 50-year-old I've ever met."" ""I played with a 48-year old in my freshman year, and at that time I realized that older golfers play a completely, different game,"" Chang said. ""But Ray plays the same kind ofgame you would expect from a college golfer, in terms of his swing and his mentality."" While golf, a sport in which Lavalle has participated since 1973, is a big part of his collegiate life, Lavalle has not lost sight of his ultimate goal of attaining a degree and pursuing a career as a juvenile counselor in the criminal justice system. Such a position will allow him to help teenagers reform their lives and avoid the specter of prison, a place where he spent almost six years of his life before being released in 1993""I had a lot of time to look at myself while in prison,"" Lavalle said. ""I wanted to put myself in a position to give something back to society rather than to take, and I felt the way to do that was through a good education. ""I'd like to work with kids in the criminal justice system, and hopefully to give them a chance to do what I'm doing now."" ""Ray is very grateful for the opportunities given to him,"" Chang said. ""The opportunity to go to college and to be at Columbia is very big for him, as is the chance to play golf and meet the people involved with it. . . .It's something he's really cherished.""COURTESY COLUMBIA SPORTS INFORMATION Ray Lavalle"
230,"SPECTATOR PERSPECTIVES Re-reading the Great Books David Denby, CC '65, goes back to the basics of the Core",14 October 1996,"Re-reading the Great BooksDavid Denby, CC '65, goes back to the basics of the CoreBy KIM VAN DUZER Spectator Staff WriterIn Great Books: My Adventures with Homer, Rousseau, Woolf and other Indestructible Writers of the Western World, New York magazine film critic David Denby tackles what has become one of the great contemporary academic debates: Do the classic works of literature and philosophy that comprise the Western canon have a place in today's multicultural American society? Denby, who graduated from Columbia College in 1965, set out to answer this question, as he puts it,""from the ground up."" Denby returned to Columbia in 1991 and re-enrolled in Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and Contemporary Civilization (CC) in an attempt to reread Western classics—the subject of much controversy as components of required curricula at Columbia and other universities across the nation —from the perspective of a non-academic 'common person.' The result is Great Books , in which Denby makes a vehement case for the aesthetic value of literature and an equally vehement one against what he calls the ""politicization"" of such texts. What follows below is, in his own words, David Denby on political ideologies, oppression, and the media culture, and their effects on what he views as the decline of reading and great literature in the late 20th century.KIM VAN DUZER: How much of your intention in writing the book was to tackle the debate about the validity of this kind of curriculum, and how much was about reviving your own interest in reading and the classics? DAVID DENBY: The initial intent was to make some contribution to the culture wars, but from the ground up. I was sick and tired of polemics from the left and right. . .that were completely external, miles away from any given book including my book. It's all politics and no literature; it's all attitude and no writing. There's been tons of these things, articles and books, and I thought they were all beside the point in some way. If you want to have an effect then jump in and try to give these people the experience of actually reading these things.That was the primary intention and I didn't realize when I began the project, in the spring of 1991, that something else was bothering me, and the something else was the other thing you're talking about. It took a while to realize that I was suffering from a sort of middle aged blase, my own form of it, which was disgust with living in the media. It's not just a film critic's disease, I think it's everyone's disease —you really can at times get tired of the second-handedness of your responses to things, and how everything comes through this filter of imagery and information, half of which is false. You beginto experience yourself as inauthentic in some ways. You lose yourself in an atmosphere of representation, and I thought, these are very powerful books they're extreme works, that's one of the reasons they're classics, and that I would be brought up into some sort of confrontation with myself and it would be very interesting to see what happened. But I didn't know that when I started, that came in by degrees. You don't have some moment as in the movies when you suddenly wake up one day, open the curtains and there it is, the purpose of your book lies before you. It doesn't happen that way. KV: In writing the book how did you avoid feeling like you were writing movie reviews of, say, the Iliad? DD: I wanted to convey some excitementin the thrill of opening this strange'and difficult text and plunging into it. So in that respect it's not different from writing a movie review, it's just that the text is so much more complex and operates on so many different levels that that sort of hyped-up, excited approach is hardly sufficient. . . .Those paragraphs are not much different from movie criticism, but then there's however one wants to take that immediate excitement and that pleasure—and I think art is all about pleasure—and carry it deeper into whatever meaning the literature has. I thought I could write this book becauseI knew something about pleasure. A movie critic who doesn't believe in pleasure has really got to be a phony. . . I'm not a scholar, I'm not a literary critic so 1 might be the right person to take readers by the hand and lead them into the labyrinth of some of these texts. KV: Do you think Columbia led you to this project, having taken these classes as an undergraduate? DD: I don't remember what my response was to a lot of these books in 1961-62. . .but I think I read some of them fairly intensely. And even if I can't remember what myresponse was, there was a response and it did sink in. Of course, this is the great mystery of education: What-do you get out of it?

231,"Students contest Core, Major Cultures at forum",30 October 1996,
232,The Lit Hum instructor's guide to teaching,6 November 1996,"By NICHOLAS JOSEPHWith the increased class sizes and the swelling of the student-faculty ratio, the Columbia administrators have had to rely more and more on graduate students to teach the Core curriculum. Since many of these students have no expertise in the works that the Core classes cover, the Committee on Enhancement has produced several handbooks on teaching Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. These manuals, written in collaboration with experts on counterintelligence, were top secret until recent disclosures at the Pentagon concerning the ClA's activities in Latin America. The following are excerpts come from a manual entitled ""Handling of Payors."" Spelling errors have been corrected. The Payor: ""Payor"" can be defined as any person who produces an influx of cash into Columbia University. Payors, then, are the most important people on our campus, next to, of course, administrators. You are not a payor. We pay your way. Don't forget it. Your class, however, will be made up of payors, and the class list you receive at the first meeting will have not only your payors' names but also detailed information as to their families' incomes and the percentage of their tuition that they pay. Be sure to memorize the names and faces of those payors who are receiving no financial aid. These payors are ~the lifeblood of this University, and you should under no circumstances anger them. They may transfer, and if they do, your time at Columbia will at an end. Your interactions with students receiving some financial assistance can be more subtle. If any of them gives you trouble, you can hint that you also work in the financial aid office and could take certain measures if there aren't certain modifications of behavior. The Texts: We understand that you are busy with your studies and may not have time to read all of the books on the syllabus.In fact, we encourage you not to read them. These works are complicated, and we aren't sure what they mean. Instead, you should read the Cliffs Notes. This is what most of your payors, if they read anything at all, will read, and so examinations that you write based on them will be a good measure of whether your payors have done their work.Payors who have read the books will be at a disadvantage when taking these examinations, and you thereby will have leverage over anyone who knows more than you do. We realize, though, that, with your busy teaching schedule you may not have time even to read the Cliff s Notes. In this case, you may use examinations written back when this course was taught by people who knew the material. Some of the questions on these examinations, however, will be about works that are no longer taught here. When this is the case, substitute a contemporary work that is on your syllabus. If your syllabus does not have a contemporary work on it, or if you are unable to determine whether anything on your syllabus is contemporary to the work in question, then substitute a work whose name is kind of similar. These questions are generally so broad that it won't make much difference. Payor's Expectations: You are not the person that your payors expected to find teaching this class. In our promotional material we downplay the role that graduate students play in teaching our classes, and some payors will enter your classroom believing that they are going to be taught by a professor. Particularly nettlesome will be the few who have read or heard something about David Denby's recent book' on the Core, which we have mass-mailed to every high school senior in the country and excerpts from which will be embossed on the new student center. Payors who are familiar with this book will be expecting to have a class with James Shapiro or Edward Tayler. Inform such payors that Mr. Denby's book is a work of fiction, which, in a sense, it is, as no Columbia undergraduate can have the sort of experience that Mr. Denby did. There is a minor risk in this course of action, however: Professor Shapiro and/or Professor Tayler might hear about it. If accosted by Professor Shapiro, you should say that you have discovered an obscure treatise on Salic law from the twelfth century and that you believe it sheds some light on Henry V. We don't know what any of this means, but we believe that it will send Professor Shapiro to the library, which will give you a chance to escape. If accosted by Professor Tayler, you should mention Wallace Stevens. Professor Tayler will begin muttering, and you should just nod your head until you believe that it is safe to go away. We are not sure who Wallace Stevens is, but we believe that he sold insurance, in which case he would make an excellent role model for Columbia undergraduates. Defending the Core: In recent years the Core Curriculum has come under attack by various groups, and some payors in your class may repeat some of the arguments that they have heard. It is possible to defend theCore on intellectual grounds, but this is hard and annoying, and, moreover, we don't know how to do it. Instead, we are going to provide you with tactics for dealing with dissent. If your dissenter has a little beard or wears sandals with socks, tell him or her that Jack Kerouac's Logic and Rhetoric papers are in the Rare Manuscripts room in Butler. If your dissenter tries to get the papers, you'll never see him or her again. If your dissenter is amulticulturalist of some sort, set aside a day for him or her to teach a work of his or her choice. Don't worry if the work chosen doesn't have a summary by Cliff's Notes. If the multiculturalist asks you any questions, just say, ""Hey, you wanted to teach a class. This is your show. I'm not going to help you."" If the dissenter wears a beret or employs literary theory that is unfamiliar to you, accuse him or her of being a fascist and say the word ""Vichy"" a lot. We aren't sure what this means, but we believe it to refer to the cow on those little packets of cheese. You can also set these types against each other by telling each in private that you secretly agree with their position but must seem impartial in class. If the dissenter is really persistent, say that the purpose behind the course will become evident when you present the final work on the syllabus and then take so long on the preceding works that you don't get to it. If all else fails, take your dissenter out for drinks. Most intellectuals have a weakness for alcohol, and if you get your dissenter drunk enough, you can probably get him or her to reveal some embarrassing secret which you can then use to keep him or her quiet. Conclusion: Remember: Have fun. This is the last time you'll teach at a place like Columhia.""These works are complicated, and we aren't sure what they mean. Instead, you should read the ClifPs Notes.""""It is possible to defend the Core on intellectual grounds, but this is hard and annoying, and, moreover, we don't know how to do it.""Nicholas Joseph, CC '97, will be offering his services as a Lit Hum substitute for all the graduate students who freak out at the pressure."
233,"Authors lead debate on merits, weaknesses of Core",20 November 1996,"By A. LEAH VICKERS Contributing WriterDavid Denby, CC '65, and Lawrence Levine, authors of books about core curriculums, led a discussion attended by approximately 100 students and faculty covering the idea of a core and its function at Columbia on yesterday evening in the John Jay Lounge. Denby, a film critic for New York magazine, is the author of GreatBooks, which chronicles his Experiences retaking Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization over 20 years after he graduated from the College. Levine, professor emeritus of history at the University of California at Berkeley and author of The Opening of the American Mind, is an advocate of the incorporation of multiculturalism in education. The discussion, mediated byDeWitt Clinton Professor of History Eric Foner, consisted of opening statements by both guest speakers followed by a discussion period. Most of the discussion revolved around the content and purpose of the Core Curriculum, especially the Contemporary Civilization (CC) course. Denby endorsed Columbia's Core and emphasized that CC ""is not a history course"" but rather anopportunity for students to think about essential issues and engage in a learning process. He spent most of his speech relating his experiences retaking the Core and his motivation for doing so. He also commented on the function of the Core Curriculum. ""[The Core] is a continuing process of self-questioning,"" Denby said.Whereas Denby approached the subject through describing his second round with the Core, Levine and Foner focused on the position of the Core in a university's entire curriculum. According to Denby, a major impact of Columbia's Core Curriculum is ""to make reading the center of your life forever. . . . Thebooks challenged me in an extraordinary way,"" he said. Levine dealt with the subject from a more historic viewpoint, arguing that over the past 200 years, scholars have been inconsistent in pointing to specific cultures as the source of Western culture ""The current debate,"" Levine said, ""is a current chapter of a much older and continuing discussion. It's hard to change a longstanding tradition."" In discussing the problems with thesecourses, Levine said, ""We just have to broaden [the study of Western civilization].'"" Once the speakers opened the floor to debate, the discussion focused almost exclusively on the purpose of the Contemporary Civilization (CC) course at Columbia. Chair of Contemporary Civilization David Johnston commented on the current theory behind teaching CC. ""I think it is true probably that historically there has been a variation in the definition of CC,"" Johnston said. Unlike Foner, who said he feels that thepurpose of the course would not change if different books were substituted for the existing ones, Johnston said he believes that the material that has been selected for the course is important in understanding Western civilization. In addition to aiding students in understanding our institutions, he said he feels that CC is ""about persistent issues that are important to our time."" Cate Reilly, CC '99, concurred with Denby's assessment of CC's relation to history, but maintained that the course couldbroaden its scope. ""I do agree with Mr. Denby about how it is not a history course. But at the same time I do think it is limited to a very rigorous and narrow exposure to the western canons."" Shani Offen, CC '97, said discussions about the Core should emphasize the goals and purpose of Core courses. ""A lot of what is missing is a discussion about what the aim of the course [is], how best to meet this aim, and if we are not, why not,"" Offen said."
234,Core teachers include many rotten apples,30 January 1997,"By IRWIN RAMIREZ LEOPANDORooting through my old junk during winter break, I unearthed my dusty copy of the Columbia view book, the large glossy one that came with the application; it is the one with a blurry picture of a serious young Ivy League intellectual striding meaningfully past Low Library. The view book, packed with vivid and exciting images, practically bursting with the energy and tantalizing promise of the Columbia Experience, was one of the main reasons 1 decided to apply to the College. Flipping through the view book and somewhat amused at my rediscovery, I decid-ed to check out how closely the advertised Columbia lived up to the Columbia I've gotten to know. I put the view book down half an hour later realizing, that in most cases, the advertising was actually not too far from the reality. The magazine portrayed Columbia, with its dizzying opportunities and dizzying choices, pretty accurately. Except in one glaring regard. On the second page of the view book is a huge photo of a Literature Humanities class in progress. Dominating the center of the spread, in a vigorously intellectual pose (reminiscent of Robin Williams in Dead Poet'sSociety) is Professor Arthur Danto, whom the caption reveals is ""the Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy"" who has written one of the most important philosophy texts of the past twenty years, who is one of New York's most respected art critics and writers, and who, of course, teaches the Core. With his brow knitted in earnest concentration and his right hand clutching Heart Of Darkness, he halfsquats, half-sits on his chair, exemplifying the""Columbia intellectual."" He is surrounded by five or six engrossed students in varying degrees of intellectual bliss. It is a great picture, perfect for luring eager young minds to the joys of a Columbia education. Unfortunately, it is also misleading at best, dishonest at worst. Anyone who has been at Columbia for more than a couple of semesters knows that there aren't too many Arthur Danto types teaching in the Core. There is a painful dearth of quality teaching, what the University proudly proclaims as ""Columbia's signature, its intellectual coat of arms."" This is especially pronounced in the core of the Core —Lit Hum, CC, Art Hum, and Music Hum. Over the past two years I've had a full professor teaching a Core class for only a single term. Now a second-semester sophomore just about done with my Core requirements, I am angry. I am angry at the University for having failed to live up to its part of the bargain, for cheating me out of an educational experience I had eagerly anticipated since I first read about the great Core Curriculum. I am angry at the University for presenting such a misleading image, for implying that the Core is packed with professors like Danto. I am angry that a select number of inexplicably fortunate students —and David Denby—are lucky enough to pick into classes taught by figures like James Shapiro and Edward Tayler, while the rest us consider ourselves lucky if our instructors are halfway decent. And I am especially angry at the University for creating a roulette game out of its students' educations by withholding instructors' names during registration. I don't think all is wrong within the Core. I know that many grad student instructors are excellent teachers; I've had some of them, and know that they can be more friendly, accessible, and enthusiastic than many professors. I know that having a bigname professor is no guarantee of a good class experience. And I also know that the University finds it hard to get tenured pro-fessors to take precious time out of their schedules to teach our Core classes. However, it is still the University's responsibility to provide the highest quality of instruction within the Core. And that still means getting professors to do the job. Not just because students are paying huge amounts of money for it, but also because the University must live up to its own high standards of academic integrity. Considering the amount of pride the University takes in its famed Core, not to mention the publicity that goes into it, these classes should be the most consistently welltaught classes offered. Moreover, the texts tackled in the Core are difficult enough without becoming more difficult from a dearth of teaching experience and expertise. The lack of these qualities, as most students quickly realize, is often painfully apparent in many graduate students' sections. The Core should not be a teaching lab or training ground. It should be what it is meant to be: An intensive discussion of important texts led by knowledgeable, experienced instructors. The University should also recognize students' basic right to choose their teachers, and the inadequacy of instruction behind the convenient screen of ""TBA"" in the pencil book. Instead of subjecting students to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune during registration, the University should release the instructors' names. Give students a chance to ask around and learn which instructors to take, which ones to avoid at all costs. This is a basic academic right that is being denied in the inherently unfair system we use today. Finally, the University should at least stop presenting a misleading image to the collegehunting public. Stop pretending that a mythical professor is in store for every high school senior lucky enough to be admitted to Columbia. Admit that many —if not most —of the Core sections will be taught by graduate students. In the end, the lack of resources is a far lesser crime than the lack of honesty.Irwin Ramirez Leopando is a Columbia College sophomore."

236,Discussion examines the Core,5 February 1997,"By BECCA BURNS Contributing WriterNearly 25 students, instructors and chairs of Core Curriculum classes gathered last night at the Heyman Center to discuss the role of the humanities in the Core. Discussion at the forum, which was sponsored by the Heyman Center for the Humanities, the Columbia College Student Council and the United Students of Color Council, extended to a number of other topics beyond its original focus, including the quality of teaching in Core classes and possible changes in Core requirements. As in previous forums in the Reaching into the Core series, students expressed concern over the Western focus of the humanities classes in the Core. Adina Berrios, CC '9B, said the education offered by the Core lacks diversity. ""I'm very well-versed in Western issues and nothing else,"" Berrios said. Chair of Art Humanities and Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History and Archaeology David Rosand noted that Core classes have tried to integrate non-Westernworks in the past with poor results. ""[These works] are thrown in as a sort of expansionist token,"" Rosand said. ""There's not a neat fit."" Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures William Theodore deßary said the major cultures requirement does exist as an alternative, but it doesn't have as strong a role in the Core. ""Even though we do have Asian Humanities, the [Core] requirements don't direct students to those classes. We have the capability to do so, and it's unfortunate that the requirements don't foster that,"" de Bary said. Rosand added that in order to do justice to major cultures classes, it is necessary to maintain small sections like those in Core humanities courses, and this requires a stronger faculty base. ""We need more faculty bodies, especially due to class size enhancement, and we're working toward that,"" Rosand said. The issue of choice in the Core was also addressed in the discussion. Some students argued for more choice among Core humanities classes, with possible substitu-tion of non-Western art and music courses for the traditional courses now required. Others suggested that the current Core, though limited in options, forces students to study topics necessary to a complete education. ""Given the option, would you take it? Maybe not. But should you take it? I think so,"" Berrios said. Chair of Literature Humanities and Professor of English and Comparative Literature Kathy Eden agreed with Berrios. ""It might be a bitter pill to swallow, but we should be forced to swallow it,"" she said. Professors and instructors noted other benefits of the Core, including the intellectual interactions between students outside of the classroom fostered by a common curriculum, with Rosand summarizing the purpose of the Core. ""The goal of [humanities courses] is to elevate the student up to some level of visual literacy and provide a vocabulary with which to discuss art. I'm not talking about simply acquiring a cocktail party vocabulary, but the ability to react intelligently to art,"" Rosand said."
237,Women in the Core lecture takes place in Wien lounge,26 March 1997,"By ELIZABETH K. CARROLL Contributing WriterHistory Professor and Contemporary Civilization Instructor Martha Howell and Art Humanities Instructor Laura Auricchio described the past, present, and future of the role of women in the Core Curriculum last night in Wien Lounge. Auricchio, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, began by talking about a feminism project which will make its first appearance in Art Humanities this fall. The project involves putting together ""kits"" on feminism that can be used as resources for the course. A team is currently working on collaborating bibliographies, discussion, essay, exam questions, and even museum visits pertaining to women and feminism. Completion of the kits is expected by summer. This fall, a simi-lar committee will begin collaborating such kits for Literature Humanities. Use of the kits will remain an option for each section's professor. ""We are not looking to incorporate more women into the Core,"" said Auricchio. ""We are trying to get professors to think about gender. These kits will enable them to draw on gender."" The readings and such materials included in the kits even contain some books written by men that bring up gender issues, according to Auricchio. ""We want students to understand both men and women and how they rely on the gender hierarchy,"" said Howell, who added that the Core has in the past attempted to incorporate feminism.""Ten to 15 years ago, we just added more women writers to the curriculum,"" she said. ""The problem was that the reason they had been left out in the first place was that they were second-rate. With this current project, we are showing how the male must exclude the female citizen."" This sparked a recollection from one of Howell's students who attended the meeting. ""The first paper that we wrote on Rousseau and the social contract had to address the question of whether the social contract could exist if it were to include women,"" said Julie Sensat, CC '9B. ""The answer wound up being that it could not exist because the men in the social contract could not have the rights provided without a private sphere in which women would have to stay."" Howell said that her education as a feminist began by deconstructing such texts as Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau. She said she sees a resistance to the patriarchy of these minds, yet she insists on their importance. ""Feminism relies on them more than the new generation realizes,"" Howell said. ""We need to really grapple not just what is wrong with them, but the possibilities they give us to speak."" Several members of the audi-ence indicated that they found it difficult to express their views on feminism with some of their Core professors. ""I think that has to do with inertia on the part of the faculty,"" Howell responded. ""They don't want to bother learning all this, which is why I think the kits are a good idea."" Auricchio added that the kits will draw feminism into courses of professors who do not tend to involve it in their curriculum by providing material like exam and paper questions when they find themselves in a bind. ""If this stuff is here, they can use it and that way it will get filtered into the system."" Meryl Zwanger, GSAB '95, questioned the availability of the kits for students. ""Will the materials be provided for students so they can have the option of exploring it even if their professor doesn't involve it in the curriculum?"" Zwanger said. Howell and Auricchio agreed that they thought it was a great idea, and Auricchio noted that the kits seemed, to her, to be an inclusive concept. ""I found I couldn't incorporate feminism without incorporating class, race, and everything else,"" Auricchio said.A discussion focusing on the importance of including women in the Core curriculum took place last night in the Wien Lounge."
238,Committee looks to evaluate cultures requirement,1 April 1997,"BY JENNA KLATELL Spectator Staff WriterThe major cultures requirement, the most recent addition to the Core Curriculum, has undergone several stages of alterations and adjustments throughout its almost ten years as part of the Core. This year, attention has once again focused on the issue of how best to introduce Columbia College undergraduates to major cultures not represented in other sections ofthe Core, such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, which have a primarily Western focus. ""The issue of major cultures is actively on the agenda of the committee on the Core,"" Chair of the Committee on the Core Professor Hamid Dabashi said. ""We are trying to guarantee that the requirement remains a viable, significant, and integral part of the Core."" . Several years ago, the Committee on the Core, which reports to the Committee onInstruction (COI) and addresses issues relating to the Core Curriculum and its instruction, formed a sub-committee to tackle the refinement of the major cultures requirement. ""The Committee on the Core, in general, and specifically the sub-committee on major cultures, is always working to define, shape, and re-shape major cultures and its place in the Core,"" Associate Dean of the College Kathryn Yatrakis said. ""The sub-committee has been working hard this semester to con-tinue this process."" Currently, all Columbia College students are required to take two courses from the list of major cultures courses found in the Bulletin. These courses are further divided into three, lists: List A is comprised of broad, introductory courses that focus on a major culture; List B contains more specialized courses; and List C contains classes whichexamine the manifestation of major cultures in America. According to the 1996-7 Bulletin, students may fill the requirement by taking, for a grade, one course from List A and one from List B. Students are ""strongly urged to take the course from List A in a related culture first,"" but are not required to do so. ""We are trying to guide students to have a good solid year with a major world culture which generates a genuine appreciation,"" Dabashi said. COI and the sub-committee on major cultures are looking into possible refinements of this system of requirements, according to Yatrakis. ""Right now we don't require students to take the course from List A first, but in my experience, students have been wise enoughto realize that they should have an introduction to a culture before they attempt a deeper analysis of a specific aspect,"" Yatrakis said. As part of a desire by faculty members to introduce undergraduate students to nonEuropean world cultures, and trace the manifestations of these cultures in America, Dabashi said, the major cultures requirement will be continually adjusted. ""We've heard from students over the years that the choices are too many; that there is no consistency in the offerings, particularly when compared with Lit Hum and CC,"" Dabashi said. ""We've been looking into what degree we can make the experience of major cultures similar to other Core classes in terms of size and instruction."" Devising a set of requirements and course offerings which will accomplish these goals is a complicated process, in part due to theimpossibilty of creating a comprehensive course on any culture, Dabashi said. ""One of the problems is that we can't offer a course, for instance, which combines every aspect of African culture,"" Dabashi said. ""But what we can do is put our thoughts together with colleagues and see if we can create a course which reflects aspects of the African culture and its extensions into America."" Despite the desire for refinement of the major cultures requirement, Yatrakis said the major cultures requirement for Columbia College undergraduates is a good program. ""We, myself included, think we have a good working structure at the moment, but we are always looking to refine and improve the curriculum, re-examine the system, and lobby for resources or changes as necessary,"" Yatrakis said."
239,GS deans look to create core,2 April 1997,"By SABRINA ROJAS WEISS Spectator Staff WriterIn a town hall meeting School of General Studies (GS) Dean of Faculty Gillian Lindt, Assistant Dean Richard Braverman, and Dean of Students Rick Ferraro spoke about academic issues to approximately 20 students in Lewisohn Lounge last night . Lindt opened the meeting with asummary of the GS Committee on Instruction's (COI) work on formulating a core curriculum for the school. Lindt said students expressed concern at a meeting a year ago that the school's lack of classes such as those in the Columbia College Core left many GS students at a disadvantage. In most of the Columbia Collegehumanities courses, which GS students often take, the professors make references to information learned in Core classes such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities Lindt explained. Because GS enrollment in Core classes is strictly limited,Lindt said they often feel they are missing the foundations professors assume they have received during their tenure as a Columbia undergraduate. To remedy the situation, the COI has been considering the creation of a core compatible with the Columbia College Core. Braverman said plans are still very vague, however. ""[The GS core] would not be a substitute for Columbia Core classes, nor try to ape them,"" Braverman said. While still using the ColumbiaCollege Core as a model, Lindt said GS would try to give the classes a more multi-cultural perspective reflective of present-day academia. ""The Core classes are hallmarks of the time period in which they were developed,"" Lindt said. A GS core would also have to be compatible with the school's tradition of using distribution requirements that accept the credits of the school's many transfer students while at the same time providing a common foundation for all students, Braverman said. ""We need something that is not just ideologically driven but alsoworks for our students,"" Ferraro said. Lindt added that GS students can take Columbia College Core courses as electives if they give her a petition in writing and there are spaces available in the classes. According to Lindt, the COI has also been reviewing the math distribution requirement in response to student dissatisfaction. Lindt said the administration has been talking to the math department about making the Basic Math course a more valuable experience for students. ""The complaint I've heard at thelearning center about Basic Math is that it isn't taught, it's told,"" Bernie Lenahan, GS '97, said. To assist the GS night students who have been having trouble taking courses required for their majors, Lindt said most department chairs have agreed to a plan to increase the number of courses given at night. The plan would make all courses required for majors available at night, rotating over a period of three years and including summer sessions. In the case of the smaller departments, which might find it difficultto provide faculty for night courses, Lindt said they would be more flexible about course requirements. To solve the problem of GS students being closed out of chemistry classes, Lindt said the department has now made a commitment to hire adjunct professors if there are not enough graduate students to teach an adequate number of class sections. Lindt said any other difficulties GS students might have with being closed out of necessary classes can usually be remedied by giving one of the administrators a complaint in writing.At last night's GS town hall meeting, administrators discussed the idea of a core cirriculum for the school's students."
240,"CC valedictorian, salutatorian named",4 April 1997,"By NATALIA MEHLMAN Spectator Staff WriterJennifer Zobel, CC '97, and Aravind Adiga, CC '97, have been named valedictorian and salutatorian, respectively, of this year's Columbia College graduating class. Every spring, the student with the highest grade point average (GPA) and another student of high academic achievement are chosen to give the valedictory and salutatory address to their fellow graduates on Class Day. ""Sometimes the GPAs are as close as a few thousandths of a point, so we examine the top tenth's entire academic record before deciding the salutatorian,"" Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka said. Zobel, a Westchester County resident, is a psychology major who devoted much of her time atColumbia to a variety of journalism internships, including positions at ABC News and New York One News. ""I didn't take five classes every semester, and now I have managed to squeeze all my classes into two days so that I can work the other days. It really takes up a tremendous amount of time,"" Zobel said. Despite committing so much time to off-campus activities, Zobel said she reflects on her time at Columbia with fondness, and said her participation on WKCR first sparked her interest in the field of journalism. ""I love Columbia; I love being in the city. Being here made me see what I want to do later. I could only have done that here because of all the opportunities ... it's a goodj j O feeling,"" Zobel said. Adiga, an Indian citizen who spent time in Australia before coming to the United States, boasts a comparable record. Along with Zobel, and two percent of their class, Adiga was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society this fall for exemplary academic performance during their tenure at Columbia. An English major, Adiga is also the only student in the history of the annual Milton Handler Prize, awarded for excellence in a particular discipline, to win the honor twice. His freshman year, Adiga was named the best Literature Humanities student, and the following year he was honored for his comparable achievement in Contemporary Civilization. For the next two years, Adiga will study at Oxford, as the recipient of the Columbia-facilitated Kellitt Fellowship, which is granted to two students each year. Adiga was unavailable for comment. ""It is really amazing how much certain students can get from their time at Columbia. These students took a wide range of courses and excelled at all of them. They have truly had great success in all that they do,"" Lehecka said of Zobel and Adiga."
241,Bookstore looks to raise trade-in value,17 April 1997,"By CARLESTE HUGHES Spectator Staff WriterA new initiative launched by the Columbia University Bookstore will attempt to increase the trade-in value of used books, often a financial disappointment for students. With the spring semester quickly coming to a close and summer plans on the horizon, many students hope to cash-in with their piles of course books ""People come in with expectations that they spent $350 and so they are expecting about $250 back. Even if we could buy back every book they'd still only get $175,"" Kevin Renshaw, general manager of the Columbia University Bookstore said. According to Renshaw, there are several reasons why students rarely see such idealistic returns on their books. Renshaw stressed that books can be purchased back for up to 50 per-cent of their original value only if the bookstore has a written guarantee from a professor or department that they are definitely going to be used the very next semester. Part of the problem, however, is that many faculty members and departments do not submit the list of books they will be using for next semester early enough for the bookstore to guarantee that they can be sold as used books the very next semester, Renshaw said. ""We really need more book requests to be submitted from faculty. Currently only 10-12 percent of book lists are turned in at the point [when books can be sold back]. This year we're trying to have at least one-third,"" Renshaw said. If a book is not on the list of the books being used by professors for next year, even if it is a text associ-ated with a Core class like Literature Humanities, Renshaw said they will not buy them back. ""We're trying to buy back as many books as possible,"" Renshaw said. It is to our advantage to have as many used books on the shelves because we make the same profit on used books and students pay less. [On a buy-back] I'm paying the same thing as a wholesaler, but I don't have to pay for freight."" In an attempt to encourage students to actually sell their books, the bookstore plans to run raffle giveaways and provide a discount card good for 10 percent off all merchandise excluding textbooks. ""Discount cards received a warm-response from students last semester and we hope to push and promote them this semester,"" Renshaw added. Furthermore, Renshaw said the type of book a student is trying to sell back will also have an effect on the amount of money they receive. ""If a book is not on a wholesalelist it will have a higher resale value. Paperbacks typically used in many Core classes ... have a much lower resale value and thus a much lower buy-back rate, "" Renshaw said. Although students can sell books back all year-round, Renshaw stressed that the best time to sell back books is finals week. ""The best time to sell back books is during finals week. We have the most extensive book lists then,"" Renshaw said. Students, who will most likely benefit from the new policy, emphasize the need for the bookstore to be more sympathetic to the needs of students. ""I think that the whole book buy-back policy should be for the benefit of students, "" Adrian Sas CC '9B said. ""The bookstore is trying to make a profit on it [buy-backs], and I think that's not necessary since it's a student bookstore. They should do the students a favor. If more books were bought-back then more people could buy them."""
242,CC alum breaking new ground in journalism,11 June 1997,"By ADRIAN MACDONALD Spectator Contributing WriterWhen the stock market crash made headlines in 1987, Dave Kansas, CC 'B9, hardly looked upfrom th e sports page. As a history major, he was neverparticularly interested in finance at all. Despite this, he has learned enough about the world of Wall Street in his post-college years to start and edit a web magazine devoted to financial news. ""People's life changes after school,"" Kansas said, ""you keep learning."" He has had a love for journalism since his days as Sports Editorat the Spectator, and after graduation he decided to pursue it as a career. For him, it was a ""challenging"" field to break into, but not impossible. The Columbia name ""didn't hurt, they'd heard of it."" But ""they would always ask, 'Oh, Columbia, did you go to the Journalism School?' And I would have to explain, 'no, no,""' Kansas said. His first job was proofreading at the Wall Street Journal. Essentially, he claims it was just intelligence and hard work that allowed him to work up to writing, though he adds the same smirk to the 'hard work' part that a regular procrastinator in Literature Humanities might give. After a few years, he was able to move to Newsday and write sports again, but eventually he returned to finance, taking a liking to learning about the world of money.""There's drama in it, it's like sports,"" Kansas said, discussing his mostly self-study financial education. ""I called up some people in the business who I knew from working at the Journal, and asked them what the important books to read were. Then, just every night, reading..."" In that sense, his Columbia experience proved vital. ""You keep learning. You use all the things you did in school, even if you didn't appreciate it then,"" Kansas said. His magazine, thestreet.com, has done well in the six months since its conception. It has several writers from major papers around the city on staff, and offers articles and up-to-the-minute information infused with irreverence and humor. Kansas said he chose to work through the web because it was""new and interesting,"" a ""ground zero"" in the world of journalism, where things are moving quickly. And at 30, venturing into a shaky new medium was risky, but he felt it was time to take a risk. He likes to be at the start of something, even if he has to listen to the web's many skeptics. Kansas believes a web magazine can be interesting as long as what is on it is tailored to the medium, rather than being rehashed from television and newspaper formats, because it is a new medium, with its own characteristics. Citing the kind of talk that goes on in journalism schools about the web, Kansas explained that the web ""combines the immediacy of an electronic medium like television, which has the ability to broadcast live events, with the textual depth of a newspaper."" ""But that doesn't really matter,""he added, not taking such pedantic theory too seriously. ""That's just journalism school."" The niche he carves with thestreet.com is to carry a full staff which writes exclusively for the web magazine, paying attention to its own strengths and quirks as a medium, and he feels that in some way his work is somewhat innovative. ""There aren't too many people out there who write original material just for the internet,"" Kansas said. In all, Kansas is happy with where he has gone. The world of journalism is a vibrant one, and in many ways he's never really left the classroom. ""Being a journalist is getting paid to study liberal arts for the rest of your life,"" Kansas said. Or, in the more popular phrasing, ""journalism is liberal arts on speed.""Alumni Corner"
243,Scholarly texts available to students on Internet,16 July 1997,"By DAVID KARP Spectator Summer BoardWhile the external facade of Butler Library continues to undergo renovations, changes are occurring in the way students can access materials as well. Students can now forego expensive paperback books in lieu of electronic versions available to students on the Internet. According to University Librarian and Director of the On-line Books Evaluation Project Mary Summerfield, complete versions of many of the books used in the core classes, Contemporary Civilization (CC) and Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), can now be accessed via a site on the World Wide Web page of the Columbia University Libraries. Access to the site requires status as a student or affiliate of Columbia University. The project is currently evaluating what makes sense to publish on the World Wide Web in light ofthe difficulty of acquiring additional texts in electronic form. ""There are only about seventy to eighty volumes available to students on the World Wide Web site,"" Summerfield said. ""We are negotiating with publishers of texts and academic materials to acquire contracts for other books. Most of the available texts are in philosophy and literature. We're hoping to add to this collection in the future and expand into other academic disciplines as well,"" she added. According to Summerfield, the project has great potential for scholars and students at Columbia. Already many other colleges and universities are developing similar projects, although the project underway at Columbia is one of the more advanced. ""Not only could students and professorsbenefit from not having to purchase books from which only a small portion will be used, but accessibility will be improved as well. Instead of lugging books from one place to another, a student could have the same access to the on-line books whether at home or in school,"" Summerfield said. Summerfield stated that the On-line Books Project has been both cursed and blessed by the rapid development and new technologies of the World Wide Web. Since the initial project proposal was written in 1995, the World Wide Web has undergone a revolution as new features and functionality has been added to it. ""Among the biggest problems we've encountered is the availability of electronic texts from publishers. Most [publishers] don'tkeep the digital versions [of the text to be published] after the printing of the text or book has been completed,"" Summerfield said. ""Acquiring these texts has become slightly easier as the world of electronic media has evolved to the point where it is now, but we are still encountering difficulties with new acquisitions,"" she added. However, according to Summerfield, the pace has picked up in recent months; several new acquisitions will be placed on the World Wide Web page very shortly. According to the Annual Report to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, January 1996January 1997, ""Oxford University Press will provide 97 scholarly monographs from its 1995 publications list 16 in neuroscience, 35 in philosophy, and 46 in literature."" The report adds, ""Columbia UniversityPress will provide four additional reference titles, about 30 textbooks in social work, about 30 monographs and textbooks that are complementary to those being provided by Oxford in literary criticism and philosophy, about 30 political science anthologies, and about 30 other monographs and textbooks in earth and environmental science."" Additionally, the time it takes for Academic Information Systems to put the books on-line has decreased dramatically. According to Summerfield, the project can only succeed with input from its users. So far, the number of users has far outweighed the number of evaluations submitted. Even the lure of a chance in a bi-weekly raffle for a $2O copy card has failed to draw more than five persons completing the on-line questionnaire, compared with the more than 200users reported. ""So far, there hasn't been that much response among the students to this project. There have been a significant number of visitors to the site, but not too many people have commented on the site. We need user feedback, especially if this project is to be a success,"" Summerfield said. Many students are supportive of the idea of accessing texts for classes on-line. According to Matthew Newman, GS/JTS 'OO, this idea is one that should have been implemented long ago. ""I was surprised to hear about the existence of an on-line books section of the library's web site. I think it's a great idea, especially if the texts included in the site are for popular classes,"" he said."
244,Columbia College to enact new advising system,30 July 1997,"By DAVID KARP Spectator Summer BoardThe Class of 2001 is in many ways a class of firsts; it is the first class to have the lowest admit rate ever, it is the first official class of the new millennium, and it will be the first to experience the new system of academic advising developed by students and the administration last year after much debate and discussion. According to University Senator and Orientation Coordinator for Columbia College (CC) and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) Josh Ratner, CC '97, incoming first-years will have the opportunity to take advantage of an entirely new advising system. Class offerings will be posted on Columbia's World Wide Web site ""to acquaintpeople with the offerings available to CC students, ranging from academic information to career-related topics."" The Offices of the Deans of Columbia College, in conjunction with the Committee on Instruction (COI), developed the new advising system last year in response to widespread dissatisfaction among both students and faculty with the current advising system. Students will no longer be required to meet with a specific adviser during the first two years; instead, the new plan offers first-year students a virtual cornucopia of faculty members and administrators to provide guidance within their fields and areas of interest. Students will no longer have to meet with a faculty member or administrator to receive their PIN number or to have their programapproved. However, students will be assigned a dean or a member of the administration to facilitate contact with faculty members in a possible area of interest. The present practice of selecting an advisor within the field of one's major or concentration will be retained. In order to be successful, the new plan relies largely on a revised relationship between students and faculty, which presupposes that students will actively seek advice from the faculty, and that the faculty will readily provide it. ""Hopefully, [the new system] will be more productive and pro-active than before,"" Ratner said. ""Rather than providing students with a single advisor to help them adjust, the new advising system will try to establish mentoring relationships between students andprofessors."" While members of all classes will have to adjust to the new academic advising system, the Class of 2001 will be impacted the most. The role of academic mentor, originally shouldered upon often unwilling members of the faculty and administration, will now be shared by resident advisors (RA's) and student advisers in the initial weeks of orientation and the academic year. The Class of 2001 will be the first to be pre-registered for first semester classes. Entering students were asked to fill out a survey in which they expressed their areas of interest. All incoming students are registeredfor a section of literature humanities, logic and rhetoric, and either music humanities or an humanities. Students expressing interest in medicine are also pre-registered for a section of calculus and general chemistry. ""What's good about this system is that not only does [pre-registration] take some of the burden off the shoulders of incoming first years, but that they [incoming first years] are not bound to the sections for which they are pre-reg-istered,"" Ratner said. ""However, because all available sections are filled because of pre-registering, it makes it difficult to switch to a different section of a class if you don't like your teacher. Additionally, while athletic concerns are taken into account with pre-registration, work-study is not."" In addition to the system of pre-reg-istration, forums will be held during orientation to explain and clarify the language and science requirements. After pre-registration, students will have room for one to two additional classes, which they may use to fulfill additional requirements.""The new advising system puts a new emphasis on and demands a large commitment from the faculty. So far, they have supported the system and expressed a desire to participate in it,"" Ratner said. Students will also play a large mentoring role in the new advising system. Student advisors and RA's will be expected to and will be trained in disseminating academic advice. ""This new system provides lots of secondary sources [of information] but few, if any primary sources,"" Ratner said. ""Because student advisors in the past have not persisted in their involvement with students for longer than two to three weeks, they are not the focus for long-term academic advising. They are, however, primary players in first semester registration, along with the RA's."" Because of the dramatic nature of the changes to the advising system, student reaction thus far is mixed and largely consists of a ""wait and see"" mindset. ""Initially, we were taken aback by the dramatic nature of some of the proposed changes,"" Vice President ofColumbia College Student Council (CCSC) Colleen Mulleedy, CC '97, said. ""We were concerned that the new plan would lessen the quality of advising available to students. However, we worked closely with the deans of Columbia College and expressed our concerns to them. Most of our concerns were noted and the program was modified to account for them. I feel a lot less nervous now,"" she added. On the whole, the program is expected to evolve over time and open up new doors to students. The new system of academic advising also is aimed at exposure of the less popular majors. For example, Time magazine, among other sources, has rated Columbia's Italian Department one of the best in the nation, yet the department has very few people interested in majoring in it. ""The popular majors, such as English, political science, economics, and history, are popular because students want to major in them. One of the goals of the new system is to demonstrate and use some of Columbia's major resources in the smaller departments,"" Ratner said."
245,Beyond the Core: the rea classes at Columbia,25 August 1997,"By ANURAG X.C. JAIN Contributing WriterYou've got a week before classes start to sit down with your blue book, your pencil book (that gray newsprint-y thing), and your new technologically-improved academic advising system and figure out what to take. Once, while frantically babbling through Thai food in my first year, I was given some excellent advice that I have been turning around in my head ever since. Strictly take good classes, with good teachers—no matter what they teach or how hard it is. A good teacher doesn't pour knowledge into your head like water into a bucket, a good teacher sets students' minds on fire. Most of your upperclass peers are petering candles. Don't get caught in culture wars and Core mudslinging. At the same time, don't buy into arguments that rest on ""tradition"" and ""culture."" You will fall asleep during lectures given to you about the history, necessity, and details of the Core —avoid all of it and you may actually get an education. Keep an ear open for ethnic studies and tenure tensions; the notions of democracy, freedom, and liberty (though wildly read about in Contemporary Civilizations) are rarely actualized in this private tyranny. Don't become institutionalized if you can help it, and like I said, who knows, you might be able to get a decent education. New York, not the Upper West Side, will be instructive. The Golden Ass, not Literature Humanities, will make you laugh. Beethoven, certainly not the cacophony of Music Hum vocabulary, will make you cry. The blue of Matisse and not Art Hum's Doric columns will make you happy. No longer take things at second and third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the specters of this college: have fun, read and think, and, again, like someone once said, take good classes. Sounds much easier than it is. The Core takes a big chunk of your time away, and between your major, and all those pre-med courses that 80 percent of you think you are going to take, your time to experiment is scarce.Our dear Alma is unique in that you do not have to have a major. Let me repeat that: At Columbia College you do not need to have a major to graduate. You can concentrate in a subject, which requires you to take less classes than the major, while enjoying all the glory that a Columbia degree can bring. Oh concentrate, concentrate, concentrate if you can! I mean, for the specifics of your future, you should consult a dean—but if you want to see yourself grow and learn, experimenting and taking as many different courses is a must and concentrating will help you. One of the more progressive (and less snooty) ideas behind the core is the idea that exposure to all kinds of disciplines will excite the embers of your mind. Take a science class, a language, read some great books, learn about a culture that is not your own. Take a film class. Dance in an intro class. Learn some drawing beyond your little doodles. Writing classes are abundant (there is a writing program through General Studies), and the theater program is infectious over at Barnard, whereas Columbia's undergraduate program barely has a pulse. You would do well to take music, history, and physical education (be it karate or kayaking). Go a little nuts. There is so much structure here that you may start feeling a little programmed. But, the right firestarters can set you running. Peter Awn's Islam class, Robert Thurman's Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, Kenneth Jackson's History of the City of New York, Beat Generation with Ann Douglas, andShakespeare with Edward Tayler are some of the Olympic courses on campus. These classes are widely attended, wildly loved. This is by no means an exhaustive list and there are some drawbacks. These classes are annoyingly overcrowded, and you may not get into them. But these crowds aren't without reason. These classes excite people—the artists, the poets, the economists, the lovers, the dreamers, and me. The history department is unusually stacked with such great profs as AlanBrinkley, Eric Foner, and Ayesha Jalal. English has George Stade, Gayatri Spivak, Kenneth Koch. Artists like Archie Rand and poets Ron Padgett have added magic into many people's work here, and reminded many theory-weary students how fun creating can be. Though this isn't an exhaustive list, I don't think that it is wrong to evaluate teachers or recognize the ones that really excite you—which is what this place should be all about. To those great teachers, who are about to teach great classes, we salute you. We strive after you. For those of you who came for more than the athletic league known as Ivy, for those who came to search instead of tell, to think instead of copy down, to create instead of copy—do not stand for easy, cheesy, and crappy teachers. You pay too much in life, for not good enough, too often. Find your own firestarters and make your own lists. Walk out of classes with horrid drones for teachers (a lesson I too often ignored, to my detriment). But most important, you shall listen to all sides, and filter them for yourself and then climb mountains.Many of the masters studied in the Core Cirriculum and other courses are featured on the facade of Butler library in the center of the Columbia campus."
246,Students present mixed views on advising system,9 September 1997,"By JENNA KLATELL Spectator Staff WriterThe 1997-98 academic year at Columbia College was ushered in last week with the arrival of the biggest class in the school's history, the usual round of free concerts and barbecues, continued construction, and the formal institution of a new system of academic advising. The new system is the product of countless hours of debate and investigation by the Columbia College Dean's offices and the Committee on Instruction (COI),and replaces the old system of academic advising, which had long been the target of widespread criticism. According to Columbia College Dean of Students Roger Lehecka, the recently instituted system, which eliminates assigned advisers, should ultimately provide students with more options for advice and mentorship from faculty members than ever before. ""Instead of assigning an adviser to be an all-encompassing resource for the range of questions that areimpossible for one person to answer, we want students to have access to everything here,"" Lehecka said. The new system represents a significant shift in the way in which academic advice is disseminated to both new and returning Columbia College students, perhaps most notably in its use of a site on the World Wide Web, accessible through the Columbia home page. The site, located at http://www.columbia.edu/cu/college/advising, presents visitors witha variety of options, including a searchable index of all professors who agreed to participate in the new system and links to sites such as the ""On-line Advising Search and Information System"" (OASIS), which guides students looking for information regarding fields of interest and possible majors. Overall, faculty members, who have long suffered under student and peer dissatisfaction with the old system of single advisors, have welcomed the new system with enthusiasm and increased participation.""Before, to get 50 faculty members to serve as advisers was like pulling teeth,"" Lehecka said. ""[Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley's] letter [sent to all faculty over the summer] produced 200 responses without spectacular efforts. Considering how many faculty members were on leave, or away for the summer, this was amazing."" The administration is hoping increased faculty support, com-bined with the efficient use of available technology, and a general overhaul of the system will put an end to student complaints and cynicism about academic advising. The class of 2001, the first to be welcomed by the new system, found several new procedures in place to help them get over what Lehecka termed ""the hump of how to deal with the many people available."" These changes included the opportunity to pre-register over the summer for sections of Logic and Rhetoric and Literature Humanities classes, and introductions to thesystem led by several deans. ""This is very much a program in progress,"" Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis said. ""First reports seem to indicate that first-year students were pleased."" Most first-years were unaware that the system was new, but several were enthusiastic about their initial experiences with it. ""My floor all went together to hear Dean Lehecka explain the system,"" Sarah Weakley, CC 'Ol, said. ""It seemed like it was mostly on the Web, which I haven't really used yet, but I left feeling confident thatif I needed any help I could get a professor's e-mail address and get advice from him or her."" Others, however, expressed concern, and even disappointment, over the lack of personal advisers. ""I pretty much thought it was horrible because you don't have one adviser who pays attention to you and helps you figure out what you need to do,"" Vanessa Buia, CC 'Ol, said. ""I came expecting some one-on-one attention and advice, but instead I'm left to read the course guide, and use the computer, to figure it all out. Also, as soon as I got to campus I realized 1 hadpre-registered all wrong over the summer and had to change everything!"" Most juniors and seniors, the vast majority of whom have already declared majors, report having little or no contact with the new system because their respective departments of study provide them with all the faculty resources they require. For sophomores, on the other hand, the real test of the system will come in October and November, when they begin thinking of next year, Lehecka said. ""I feel a little left out in the cold that if I need my adviser this year,"
247,The Virgin Mind DANIEL KOKHBA A need for pre-professional courses,18 September 1997,"A need for pre-professional coursesFellow Columbians, I feel the need to share with you a bit of personal news. But before our relationship takes this momentous leap, explanations are in order. You see, it is a technique of long monologues to fill up space with irrelevant information. Whether it is an uncontrollable phenomenon that takes hold of certain writers or simply a manner of alienating unwanted readers, it should be banned.My news, on the other hand, is quite relevant. In the very least, it is partially responsible for today's column. At the most, it could change the face of the current Columbia curriculum. This innovation will center around the addition of pre-professional courses. The Columbia community should not be expected to base its post-graduation plans solely on a liberal arts education. This conclusion did not strike me until aweek ago, when I unexpectedly received a gift. The gift itself was enough of a-surprise, but its content can best be labeled ironic. I was presented with a set of miniature books containing Biblical proverbs. My enthusiasm was not based on aninnate love of proverbs, but rather in the opportunity to finally read something other than Aristotle's Politics and TV Guide's Cheers and Jeers. And so I engaged the text like 1 would any one of the 30-plus Contemporary Civilization books. My goal was to absorb a few proverbs into my system so that I could casually regurgitate them during a conversation with the gift giver. Then it happened. I picked up the book titled Ecclesiastes and randomly opened to the page that inspired this very column. The quote that enlightened me read as follows, ""So I saw that there is nothing better for man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot."" (3:22) Upon reading this line I began to observe. I watched my elders and questioned their happiness in respect to their jobs. I hoped to find them fully satisfied. Unfortunately, the results were mixed. Consequently, my next target was none other than the Columbia student body. The results fell into certain categories, as I expected. This fact disturbed me. It seems to me that the well-educated graduating masses of Columbia have flocked to only a handful of directions. The Columbians who embraced the need to help the ill stuck through the hardships of the sciences and entered the medical profession. Those who read the 60+ Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities books from front to back entered the legal sphere. Others put theirtrust and curiosity into their major and continued studying, and quite a few prepared to enter corporate America. Although a significant percentage paved their own road, not enough did so—in my opinion—and as it stands, not enough will. It is a fact that most Columbians, upon leaving the Ivy-League gates, were armed with incomparable knowledge, a superior mastery of e-mail, and a great appreciation of the liberal arts. Sadly enough, some have admitted that they did not know what to do with the knowledge, therefore chose a working career that proved, at times, disappointing. To any reader who shares my concern, I offer this proposition —not to be mistaken as a solution. A set of introductory courses in a variety of professional fields would supplement and possibly complete the current services offered. At the very least, such basic courses may deter or encourage a specific career path. Academic and somewhat objective exposure to medicine, law, publishing, journalism, counseling, nutrition, education, banking, advertising, and numerous other careers would prove highly valuable. A well-thought-out survey course on a profession, has the promise of being as beneficial as an internship, if not more so. I encourage the Columbia community to evaluate the addition of pre-professional courses theoretically, and to look at how they can be implemented. Consider these ideas as if the future depended on them. It may.Daniel Kokhba, CC 'OO, enjoys his work, because that is his lot."
248,Latino studies debated at forum,7 October 1997,"By MARGARET FARRAND Contributing WriterA panel of Columbia and Barnard Latino studies professors led a forum last night in the Schapiro Lounge to discuss the relationship between Latino scholarship and the Columbia Core. The forum, co-sponsored by the Columbia Latino studies program, was pan of an ongoing series of events commemorating the ninth annual Latino Heritage month and focused on issues currently confronting Columbia's Latino studies program, which was created in the spring of 1996. Assistant Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Gus Puleo opened the forum by sharing his feelings on the structure of the Literature Humanities curriculum. Puleo, who teaches Literature Humanities, said the class allows him to feel more integrated into the Columbia community because it exposes him to students outside the area of Latino studies. In his selection of supplementary materials for his Lit Hum class, Puleo said he tried to include otherworks he considers ""canonical."" He described the composition of the Lit Hum syllabus as ""flexible and elastic, constantly being revised as the nation changes."" Pointing out that the decision to include or exclude any text on a syllabus is always controversial, Puleo expressed hope that future changes to the list would include more works by non-European authors. Following Puleo's points, Adjunct Professor of Latino Studies Carlos Sanabria addressed what he described as the common idea that ""ethnic studies is divisive."" ""Ethnic studies reflects the highly segregated nature of society as it exists,"" Sanabria said. He described this study of preexisting social divisions as ""a valuable mechanism for creating unity"" among various ethnic groups. ""[Minorities'] right to demand ethnic studies should not be questioned,"" Sanabria said, ""because minorities have made huge contributions to the history and culture ofthe United States."" Barnard Assistant Professor of Spanish Alicia Fiol-Matta continued the forum with a discussion of the proper role of ethnic studies programs in universities. ""The creation of a Latino studies program is not enough,"" Fiol-Matta said. ""[The program must] transform the structures that shape the experience of most minority individuals."" Fiol-Matta described affirmative action at Columbia as letting in only a ""handful of Latino students,"" and cautioned against what she saw as a tendency for universities to use ""assimilating measures"" to dilute the content of ethnic studies programs and take minority students away from their cultural communities. ""[We, as a program, must] make an effort not to become complacent, not to stagnate, to retain contacts and communications with students,"" Fiol-Matta said. ""[Columbia'sLatino studies program] needs to abandon strategies of superficial inclusion and address ... concrete transformation."" Francisco Rivera-Batiz, newlyappointed head of Columbia's Latino studies program, concluded the forum with a discussion of the history of Latino studies programs at universities throughout the United States. Whereas such academic programs traditionally focused on particular Latino populations, such as Puerto Rican studies or Dominican studies, Rivera-Batiz said, since the 1980s universities have increasingly been combining these cultures into more broadly-based Latino studies departments or programs at their schools. He described this trend as creating ""a new cultural space, which we call Latino,"" and described the mass media as a ""force that tends to pull together the Latino population."""
249,Applause or Else!! THEATER review,9 October 1997,"THEATERreviewBy HANNAH BUDNITZAPHRODITE'S DUNGEON III: I WANT WHAT I WANT By Judy Sheehan The Looking Glass Theatre 422 West 57th Street 307-9467 At 11pm through November 12It was like one of those blockbuster summer action movies. The title is catchy and the synopsis is clever. It draws you into the theatre for a quick break from reality. Itis a brazen, big screen extravaganza, and you laugh a bit at the one-liners. And yet, when you exit the theatre, you wonder if you missed something. You wonder why it didn't leave you with a bold impression. As the hours pass, and reality creeps slowly in, you wonder why you laughed and whether you actually liked it at all. Those questions were certainly on my mind after watching the hormonal roller-coaster show, Aphrodite's Dungeon III: I Want What I Want. The ideas of the play were exciting and amusing. What Literature Humanities student could resist seeing Zeus played like Woody Allen and Oedipus as an Elvis impersonator? And they weren't even the main characters. The whole play is billed as The Inter-Active Talk Show of the Gods, with the hostess revealed as none other than Aphrodite, the goddess of love. The audience participation aspect involves voting on who is the biggest asshole. The choices? Not only Zeus, king of the gods, and Oeddy, the ""motherfucker King of Thebes,"" but also a MaryPoppins-esque Athena, and the hormone gods Testosterous and Premenstruous. It is the satisfaction of every woman's wildest dreams to get a chance to take a stab at her worst enemy, complete with mood swings, food cravings, and the power to inflict paralyzing cramps on anyone nearby. How could a show with such incredible possibility for parody and audience-involving escapismfall short? Unfortunately, it was all too easy. From the actors' boisterous but ultimately confused entrance with dancing and disembodied laughter, the show was packed with loose energy that never found a focus. The actors were always screaming, not talking, and constantly forced themselves right in the audience's face. Sometimes this was on purpose, such as when Premenstruous put a spell on all the females in the cast, causing Athena to sing ""Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious"" to those with mid-aisle seats, while Analysis (the goddess of therapy) picked lint off the sweater of a woman in the front row. However, even when the house lights dimmed and the actors went back to the stage area, there was a complete lack of subtlety. The director approached the play as an exercise in exaggeration and exploitation of stereotypes. The script did not bother to develop its clever ideas, but rather indulged in male-bashing and blatant sexual talk. Any possibility of making a serious statement about womanhood was lost with Aphrodite's leather scepter and the ""Ultimate Asshole Vote."" In fact, the very beginning outlined the basic flaw of the production. The character Ricky (Lake), held up the back of his clipboard with a big 'A' on it. He told us that if we didn't want a bitchy goddess on our backs, we had better applaud, stamp, whoop, etc. as loud as possible whenever he held up his 'A.' This was a compressed depiction of the tone of the complete work. Forcing the audience to loudly proclaim its enjoyment may produce a theatre full of laughter, but it also produces a hollow feeling in viewers. Unfortunately, looking for true meaning in Aphrodite's Dungeon is an experience as empty as sitting down with a tub of popcorn and looking for philosophy in Batman and Robin."

251,Sam I Am SAMANTHA FONG Lit Hum needs universal standards,19 February 1998,"Lit Hum needs universal standardsI am a victim of Lit Hum. Maybe we could form a support group for those who have been cheated by the evils of Literature Humanities, specifically the blatantly based-on-luck lottery which distributes Lit Hum teachers. Since the majority of Lit Hum students are freshmen, we can assume that most students were randomly picked by computer for pre-scheduled Lit Hum sections. We can rule out the possibility of a conspiracy to stick all students whose last names begin with ""M"" in a Lit Hum section at an inconvenient time and with an unreasonable Lit Hum teacher. So, how is it that one can end up with a Lit Hum teacher whose teaching style completely contradicts that of another teacher? Admittedly, teaching styles differ.We've all known that ever since kindergarten, when it was always the other teacher who took her class out to recess while we sat inside a boiler of a classroom. Perhaps themore suitable question here is: why aren't there standards for all Lit Hum teachers to follow, and if there are, why are they not followed? Suppose Bob loves his Lit Hum teacher during the beginning of the year. Easy tounderstand, since he was one of those teachers who said, ""I want you to think for yourselves. In your essays, I want you to write down ideas that we haven't discussed in class. In fact, those essays will probably hold more weight in my mind than the essays that only include the topics we've talked about in class."" In this class, there are no quizzes. In fact, there is only class after class of discussion, which vary from why one student does or does not like Herodotus (The Histories) to who in the world would ever want to havesex with a donkey (The Golden /Iss)? Simply put, discussions concern everything but the text. It seems as if Bob is lucky, considering Dan's Lit Hum teacher, who gives quizzes on reading every class and states, ""What the author says is truth. What you say is not even worthy of class time because you are not the renowned author of a classic."" Too bad for Dan, until mid-terms roll around. Judging from his mid-term grade, Bob discovers that his teacher does not agree with his new, never-discussed-in-class ideas. Dan, however, aced his mid-term because he had diligently learned all of the classics' literary devices. Not only does he walk away with an A in Lit Hum, but he has also gained knowledge of literary classics. Worse, Bob talks to Ann, whose Lit Hum teacher ""did not believe"" in mid-terms (what?!?!) and, according to rumor, graded quite easily on the finals. Then meet Liz, who was lucky enough to have a real professor for Lit Hum. Not only does she learn about the classics, but this professor is a reasonable grader who takes new ideas and discussed class material into consideration. What is Bob to do? There are such extreme teaching styles in the Lit Hum department that one cannot possibly say the grading system is just. Who is to say that Bob's teacher's style is wrong? Yet, how can Bob's grade possibly compete with Dan's? And if Bob's new ideas are really notthat insightful, can he at least walk away from Lit Hum claiming that he learned something about the authors' literary devices instead of why his classmates did or did not like a certain text? It is a simple request to ask that we leave Literature Humanities with some newfound knowledge of literature. Although asking students to learn to think for themselvesinstead of memorizing authors' intentions is a legitimate objective, one should not forget the original purpose of Lit Hum, which is to spread knowledge of Western classics. It is clear, then, that Lit Hum has many faults. Would the formation of a standardized grading system be too far fetched? True, Columbia forewarns students of the Core Curriculum, and one may find faults with the Core before applying, but would one really sacrifice attendance to an Ivy League school in New York City just because one does not like the Core? Alas, one must pity the poor, misguided souls of the Columbian student body; whoever said that one makes his own luck obviously did not take Lit Hum.Samantha Fong is a Columbia College first-year.Simply put, discussions concern everything hut the text."
252,Poet Laureate drops by a Literature Hum. section,24 February 1998,"By BENJAMIN LOWE Spectator Staff WriterWhile many students cum to Cliff's Notes to plumb the depths of Dante's Inferno, a Literature Humanities section yesterday turned to the Poet Laureate of the United States. Robert Pinsky, author of a best-selling translation of Dante's classic, dropped by the Lit-Hum section that his daughter is in to discuss the Inferno and read from his translation, yesterday. Pinsky, who teaches in the graduate writing program at Boston University, spoke about why he translated the Inferno, answered students' questions about the classic, and concluded by reading excerpts from his translation. ""it was such a joy to have a poet reading poetry to us,"" said Rachel Adams, the course's instructor and assistant professor of English and Comparative Literature. Using the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow translation and several others as guides, Pinsky said translating the Inferno became an ""obsession"" that took him a year to complete in rough form. ""F couldn't stop doing it,"" Pinsky said. Pinsky's translation differs from previous ones because he emphasized how the words sound, not necessarily trying to maintain the rhyme scheme. ""So much of the project focused on the sound of consonants and vowels that sometimes I say I'm not a translator but a metrical engineer,"" Pinsky said. ""This uanslatton is meant to be heard."" Pinsky also discussed the inevitable problems associated with translating works into English. ""You might say there is no such thing as translation [because) you can't cany the meaning across different languages like you may carrybread across a bridge from one side to the other,"" he said. Pinsky also said it is good to review several translations to get the overall meaning. ""It's good to look at two to three translations so that you can add the three together and divide by three to get the notion,"" he advised. JLit-Hum sections currently use a translation by Allen Mandelbaum, which Pihsky said was more of a line-by-line translation. ""Mandelbaum's translation is very good,"" he said ""It is a translator's translation, which doesnot have the quality of speed compared to Longfellow's,"" Pinsky said. ""It is one of two I would use in class, if mine did not exist."" Pinsky referred to an essay by Walter Benjamin that sums up the pitfalls of translation. ""Dante wrote the best translation of the original in the mind of God,"" he said. ""None will ever translate the Italian and make as good a translation."" As Pinsky was reading excerpts from his translation, he explained the action of the Inferno. ""The action of this work goes into the earth and comes out at the other side,"" Pinsky said- ""Souls go into their own story and Dante goes into his own politics to go throughhis defects of desire and despair."" Dina Maccabee, CC 'Ol, a student in the class, said she enjoyed Pinsky's reading of his translation because it made her fee} dose to the text, ""I fust thought {the reading] brought the text to life in a way we have not done before, just because the translations feel so removed when we read them,"" Maccabee said. ""The authors and translators themselves are dead and gone."" ""Because he is alive and drew attention to the fact it is poetry and has a life of its own, beyond the grand themes of Western Culture we try to attach to it,"" she said. Adams said she appreciated Pinsky's visit. ""I really think this is the kind of text you want to hear aloud, and it is valuable to have someone who is such a ■ ■■ ■ •; ■ ■ • ■■■. ■powerful speaker read it,"" Adams said. ""We were very lucky."" Ethan Peristein, CC 'Ol, a student in the class, also thought it was a good idea to hear the text read aloud. ""I though it was an excellent idea to bring htm in. His translation was more powerful than Mandelbaum's and hearing htm say it was a very nice experience because he seemed to know how to vocalize the text,"" Peristein said. Pinsky 1 s received the Academy of America Poets' London Award for Translation and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for his translation. His translation was also used by the Book of the Month Club. He was appointed National Poet Laureate and Consultant by the Library of Congress March 28, 1997.Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky visited his daughter's Lit-Hum class yesterday."
253,Odyssey: A First-Year Housing Travelogue Spectator Follows Carman Trio through the Suite and Sour of Housing Selection,12 March 1998,"By L.J. GOLDMAN Spectator Contributing WriterThe smell of drama wafts through Carman Hall. Betrayal, secrets, and schemes lurk behind closed doors. It's a scene Aaron Spelling could not have written better himself.For three firstyears living in Carman, negotiating the pitfalls of theimpending housing lottery has proven a nail-biting affair on par with a Melrose Place season finale. The trio, Billy Kingsland, Susan Pereira, and Joe Rezek, decided to live together during first semester and spent weeks devising lists of potential suitemates. They were eyeing sevenperson suites in Ruggles Hall or sixperson suites in 47 Claremont. ""I started thinking about housing before winter break,"" Kingsland said. ""I knew there were people I could live with, didn't want to live with, but would have to live with."" Unfortunately, the list grew to 12 by the time word had spread to all of their friends. With such a large group, their former housing plans proved untenable. Unable to shorten the list to a workable suite size, the three joined with nine others in a carefully conceived plan to obtain Special Interest housing, often considered a convenient and safe alternative to the lottery system. Over email, conference calls, and behind closed doors, the twelve firstyears brainstormed potential suite ideas. Among their rejected ideas were the ""Cigar Smoking Vegetarians Suite"" and the ""Bodily Dysfunction Suite."" After consulting Professor Michael Seidel, Rezek's Literature Humanities instructor, Rezek proposed the ultimate plan: ""The Lit Hum Connection Suite."" The plan, which, according to Rezek, received positive support from First Year Dean Katherine BalmerWittner, entailed monthly brunches and discussions about the relevance of Literature Humanities texts to the life of a typical Columbia student. ""We kept saying, 'lf the Japanese animation suite has Special Interest Housing, then why wouldn't we get it?',"" Kingsland said. According to the proposal, brunch themes included ""Sex and Love, Plato Style,"" which was described as an event where ""members will invite first years and the LBGC [Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Coalition] to discuss Plato's Symposium while dining on Greek cuisine."" Also suggested was ""Brunch withMoses and Jesus."" During this meal, the trio proposed, ""members will discuss Old and New Testaments and the difference between Christian and Jewish tradition in the world... "" Rezek eagerly pitched the idea to the 11 others, only to hear mixed reviews. ""I thought it was awesome bullshit,"" said Pereira. ""I kind of thought it was going to happen. It would be torturous work I didn't want to do next year, but I would have."" After Rezek submitted the Special Interest application to Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Brian Paquette, the 12 first years endured two weeks of rumors and unsubstantiated speculation about the possible outcomes. 'Things varied day to day,"" explained Kingsland. ""One day, it would be, We're going to get it!' We'd talk to people who thought it was such a good idea. Then the next day, we'd just look at each other and say, What were we thinking?""' The special interest plan finally fell through after Rezek spoke with Dean Paquette shortly before official decisions were announced. According to Rezek, Paquette explained that Special Interest housing with first-year themes are rarely selected because extensive resources are already available under the First Year Program. In early March, Rezek was notified by Dean Paquette that the ""Lit Hum Connection"" application had been rejected. The decision sparked tensions among the group. 'We were pissed. What were we going to do about our suite? After that, it all just fell apart,"" said Rezek.The 12 first-years quickly realized that obtaining a suite together would be impossible. The large group disintegrated, and Rezek, Pereira, and Kingsland found themselves in their original position of uncertainty. For two weeks, the dispirited trio avoided the issue, until the University Residence Halls housing brochures arrived. The stress from the Special Interest application ordeal extended beyond housing issues to personal and academic arenas. ""I think it necessarily, but unwittingly forces friendship issues to the surface that you'd prefer to stay underneath,"" Kingsland said. Pereira said having to mediate conflicts among friends during finals period compromised her school work. ""It affected my finals last semester,"" she said. ""We all went crazy."" While sensitive deliberations ensued over a new housing plan, tensions flared between various factions of the initial 12. A previous trip to London, planned well before the Special Interest suite was rejected, resulted in two opposing groups flying two different airlines, and hatching elaborate plans to avoid each other in Hyde Park. Some members of the group wonder whether having so many housing options is worth the hassle. 'This is like an episode of 'Real World',"" Pereira said. ""My body can't concentrate. [Suite selection] forces you to divide groups of people up. Who do you choose? Who is in charge? One alternative is no suite, which sucks. Itwould be easier if there was a specific sophomore housing and everyone of us had that housing."" According to Vice President for Student Services Mark Burstein, most students experience ""twists and turns"" as they navigate the housing process. He said he was confident, however, that most students appreciate the variety of Columbia's housing. ""I think it's wonderful that this system offers students so much choice. There are new buildings, old buildings, suites and sin-gles. It's nice to offer students a great deal of selection."" Rezek, Kingsland, and Pereira finally reached an agreement with four members of the initial suite. They want to live in a suite in Ruggles, but realize the necessity of a good lottery number. Who of the group will pick to pick? One of the original ""Lit Hum Connectors,"" Nancy Perla, CC 'Ol, who claimed to have a winning record. ""She told us she was lucky,"" Pereira said. ""She won sunscreen once.""Losing the Lottery First in a seriesFirst-years Billy Kingsland, Susan Pereira, and Joe Rezek discuss their options for suite living."
254,"The Goddesses are Definitely Smiling, and laughing, and snorting, and doubling Over..... review",16 April 1998,"reviewBy ATHALIA LUJOAPHRODITE'S DUNGEON: THE PILOT EPISODE By Judy Sheehan The Lookins Glass Theatre 422 West 57th Street 307-9467Imagine yourself at the taping of some sleazy talk show, like Ricki Lake or Jerry Springer. Then replace the host with Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, except now she's an updated, leather-wearing, whip-bearing version of herself. The Village Voice called her ""Oprah on acid."" Throw in some sexy nymphs, a few other Greek gods, and a rip-off of the Oprah theme song, and you have yourself Aphrodite's Dungeon: The Pilot Episode. This comedy simulates the taping of a talk show right down to the audience question-and-answer sessions, the pre-recorded promos for tomorrow's show, and the commercial breaks. These commercials are some of the humorous highlights of the play. Psychic networks by the gods, cruise lines with ties to Ulysses, and douches by the god of the sea are just some of the twists on the commercials that are an integral part of American culture. To top it all off, everyone gets a sugary snack to keep the energy level and the rowdiness up. Is this a play or an actual talk show? The show is definitely lots of fun, whatever else it is. The crowd was laughing the entire time at the Greek-gods-as-New-Yorker stereotypes (if that actually exists!), the television talk show cracks, and the comedic twists on various mythological stories. Literature Humanities is val-idated as references to The Iliad and The Odyssey—Helen of Troy, Ulysses' long voyage home, the Sirens —pass over the heads of most of the other audience members. The plot is loosely based on the successful attempts of the talk show queen herself, Aphrodite, to expose the tension in Zeus and Juno's marriage. Zeus is cast as a Woody Allen impersonator, neurotic and horny, and Juno is a woman of the '9os, from aerobicizing while carrying a cellphone to worrying about maintaining her image of control. The audience and host both revel in the degradation of watching all their dirty little secrets revealed. Performed at the Looking Glass Theatre, the production is obviously low-budget and off-off-Broadway. The costumes seem improvised, the set consists of a row of white wooden chairs for the 'guests', and the audience sits on folding chairs. In addition, the actors slipped up on their lines a couple times, but this may have been due to opening night jitters. Otherwise, the acting was light, fun, and amusingly exaggerated. While the show is far from a stylized Broadway production, and the story might seem a little silly to all those serious theatergoers out there, Aphrodite's Dungeon: The Pilot Episode is undeniably comedic recreation. It was written by Judy Sheehan, Playwright-in-Residence for the Looking Glass Theatre and is co-directed by Ms. Sheehan and Justine Lambert. These women are engaged in an effort by the company to expand the role of women in theater. The show is true to this goal, although it doesn't exactly make an effort at breaking down feminine stereotypes in the process. The production consists of mainly female actors but all of them are beautiful and scantilyclad, which, to be fair, is completely appropriate for an ensemble of goddesses and nymphs. So if you're in the mood for a theatre experience that will combine your esoteric knowledge of Greek mythology with your more practical experience with Jerry Springer, Aphrodite's Dungeon: The Pilot Episode is definitely the place to go. Your funny bone will thank you."
255,FOR FALL 1998: Undergraduate Departments Change Curriculum for '9B,6 May 1998,"By DEME KASIMIS Spectator Associate News EditorStudents will see changes in the curricula of the French, History, Humanities and Film Studies Departments next fall, following approval by the Committee on Instruction (COI). As the results of on-going departmental ""self-stud-ies,"" some of the curriculum changes are attempts to make majors in those departments more coherent, Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis said. For language students interested in the social sciences, the French Department will be offering a major in Francophone studies. According to the chair of the French-Romance Philology Department, Pierre Force, courses in Francophone studies will explore the origins of French universalism, its present-day relevance, and the legacy of French colonialism. ""Why would American undergraduates be interested today in studying France and its former colonies? Because if you look at modern world history, there were only two universalisms in the world: French and American,"" Force said. ""If s a different way of asking the same questions we are asking ourselves now,"" he added, suggesting multiculturalism as one issue. Force said Francophone studies, which was designed as an interdisciplinary major, will appeal to students with proficiency in French who are considering majors in history or political science. ""I'm not expecting huge numbers, but I would hope that we would find 20 or 30 majors next year. The ones I have talked to have told me that they are interested in political science and France and Francophone studies,"" Force said. Looking to make the history major more rigorous, the History Department will be offering students the opportunity to write a senior thesis in a seminar. Currently, according to History Department Chair Martha Howell, history majors may complete theses in their independent studies. ""We have formalized the senior thesis option by having one in American history and one in wider Europe,"" Howell said. ""In addition, students will be able to do independent studies.""For the first time, students who write a senior thesis and secure at least an ""A-"" average in their history classes may be eligible for honors in history next year, Howell said. The department will also be offering three new courses in historical methodology: one in historiography, one on theories of history, and one on quantitative methods. ""The courses are targeted at juniors with the notion that once someone has declared a major it's a good idea to take one of the methodology courses to help develop the critical skills and techniques to write a thesis,"" Howell said. ""We wanted to provide students with an experience that was of a different intellectual content."" In an attempt to improve students' writing skills, the Humanities Program has designed a number of workshops to target the writing needs of students in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations. Humanities Program Director Cathy Popkin said the workshops will run on a pilot program basis next year before they are fully implemented. The main goal, according to Popkin, is to integrate student writing with the Core while improving students' writing skills. Students who pass the test to place out of Logic and Rhetoric or exhibit strong writing skills in their classes will be exempt from Logic and Rhetoric, but will have to attend a fifth hour of Literature Humanities. Students will spend this extra hour on writing assignments related to Literature Humanities. Students whose writing and verbal skills are not adequate for immediate placement in Logic and Rhetoric sections have previously been placed in Methods of Critical Analysis (MOCA), and had to take Introduction to Logic and Rhetoric in their first semester and begin Literature Humanities and Logic and Rhetoric in their second semester. Under the new plan, Popkin said, MOCA students will take Critical Writing three times a week along with Literature Humanities ""to make the Lit Hum experience positive."" Students enrolled in the regular first-year composition class Logic and Rhetoric will have the opportunity to work with writing tutors in their various sections. ""Students having trouble will be urged to work on their regular Lit Hum papers and submit them to the writing tutor before submitting them [to Lit Hum],""Popkin said. Students will submit two drafts, one from before and one from after their tutorials, to their Literature Humanities professors. According to Popkin, writing tutors will also be assigned to various sections of Contemporary Civilization next year. ""It is so evident to me that students really need one-on-one help,"" Popkin said. ""My hope is that this will give students the extra opportunity to hone their skills."" ""There's just a hunger for that kind of help,"" Popkin said. 'This is for everybody. Everybody deserves to improve."" In an effort to refine its curriculum, the Film Studies Department altered some of its requirements and added new courses to its bulletin. Introduction to the Study and Theory of Film will be offered in both the fall and spring semesters next year in order to accommodate the growing number of students interested in taking the class, Director of Undergraduate Film Studies Annette Insdorf said. ""We feel that every student should take the intro class before the advanced classes, and the intro classes were always over-crowded,"" Insdorf said. Laboratory courses, which formerly counted for 1.5 credits, will count for three credits, but must be taken in the semester following their respective lectures. Previously, the lab in screen writing was taken in conjunction with the lecture in script analysis. Starting next year, students must take Script Analysis before Screen Writing. Film Theory I was made into a two-semester sequence (Film Theory I and Film Theory II) to be taken with the lab in fiction. The department also added a new course, entitled ""Writing Film Criticism."" ""We wanted to capitalize on what we see as the unique opportunities of Columbia's film program, namely, as an undergraduate scholarly film major, connected to a renowned graduate film production conservatory,"" Insdorf said. ""This is a continuation of what has been an on-going effort to keep improving, keep refining, keep strengthening a popular major that is really quite rigorous,"" she added."
256,Labyrinth Books Gains Increasing Market Share,28 September 1998,"By RACHEL COHEN Spectator Staff WriterThe campus bookstore at Lion's Court may be facing a potential rival as Labyrinth Bookstore, a special project of University Provost Jonathan Cole, increases its sales of textbooks to the University community. Although the campus bookstore sells about 70 percent of the textbooks for Columbia classes, Labyrinth is gaining a foothold in the University textbook market. A year ago, Labyrinth opened at its West 112 St. location, thanks to the efforts, in part, of Provost Cole. Cole, who wanted a bookstore that sold scholarly books from uni-versity presses, said that the idea of an independent bookstore like Labyrinth was modeled on the Seminary Bookstore at the University of Chicago. According to Deputy Vice President for Institutional Real Estate Bill Scott, at the time of the post office relocation to the middle of 112 th St. two years ago, Cole suggested constructing a building that would house Labyrinth on the second floor. ""It was a relatively simple matter to add a second floor,"" Scott said. Scott said the bookstore owners pay a fair rent for the space locatedon the second floor in the middle of the block, as opposed to a storefront on Broadway. Even with its less visible location, Labyrinth is finding ways to lure in customers, including a 25 percent discount to professors who order their textbooks through them. Labyrinth co-owner Chris Doeblin said Labyrinth's textbook sales have been growing for the three semesters the bookstore has been open. ""We have a lot more [textbooks] than last semester,"" he said. According to Doeblin, textbook sales are a big percentage of his sales in September and January, but not for the whole year. The rest of the year, Labyrinth's inventory is mainly devoted to scholarly works that appeal to professors. Assistant Professor of Economics Roberto Perotti ordered the textbook for the econometrics class he is teaching through Labyrinth because of the 25 percent discount, in addition to his willingness to support an independent bookstore. ""[Labyrinth] is good for the Columbia community,"" he said. Some students prefer Labyrinth, as well. Cathy Marcinkevage, SEAS 'Ol, likes buying her books at Labyrinth because it has a better atmosphere than the campus bookstore at its current site. ""[Labyrinth] is more of a real bookstore,"" she said. She added, though, that in the end, she was indifferent about her choice of bookstores. ""I charge it all and it goes to the same place,"" she said, explaining the purchase of her LiteratureHumanities texts were split between Labyrinth and the campus bookstore. Cole said he thought all the bookstores in the Morningside Heights neighborhood could withstand the competition for textbook customers. He added that multiple bookstores improve the neighborhood. ""My desire is to have as many outlets for culture in the neighborhood as we can,"" Cole said. He predicted that the competition will diminish when the campus bookstore relocates to its permanent site in Lerner Hall. The campus bookstore plans its move to Lerner Hall in February of next year, according to General Manager Kevin Renshaw. He said the textbooks sales account for two-thirds of his bookstore's business. ""Getting the book-list is the core of our job,"" Renshaw said. The campus bookstore is run by the Barnes and Noble book chain and overseen by Columbia's Business Services. Linda Caruso, executive director of Dining and Business Services, said professors are free to order their books wherever they please. She said the professors place their orders based on what the students want. Students say they look for convenience and good prices. Hannah Budnitz, CC 'Ol, went to four different bookstores to get her books and course packet in an effort to save as much money as possible. She added that she would rather support independent bookstores than large chains. ""I prefer giving my money to Labyrinth and Papyrus,"" Budnitz said.Labyrinth provides alternative book shopping."
257,the Core how does our core compare? the core over there...,28 September 1998,"how does our core compare?the core over there...By BECCA BURNS Spectator Staff WriterAt the center of every student's experience at Columbia College lie 18 semesters of shared, intensive liberal arts and sciences training better known as the Core Curriculum. Its goal, according to the College Bulletin, is to provide ""all Columbia students, regardless of their major or concentration, with wide-ranging perspectives on significant ideas and achievements in literature, philosophy, history, music, art, and science."" It seeks to attain this goal through an approach virtually no other American universities take: a relatively long sequence of courses broken down into small sections and required of every single student enrolled in the school. These are Columbia's famous Hums.Columbia's core is like no other. In comparison to other universities notorious for their extensive undergraduate requirements, Columbia's core is two semesters worth of courses longer than the University of Chicago's, eight and a half semesters longer than Stanford's, and ten semesters longer than Harvard's. Of course that says nothing of schools noted for their lack of required core courses, such as Brown, which requires zero courses to Columbia's 18. Even compared to colleges with larger general requirements, Columbia is the only traditional liberal arts program to require specific courses, aside from freshman composition, on top of a broad base of distribution requirements. These required courses, the Hums, are perhaps the most idealistic part of the core, aiming to expand both students' and instructors' abilities to think and argue critically, write lucidly, and to promote a community of ideas which extends outside the classroom into students' everyday conversations. These .pedagogical ideals present problems, however: how is the College to provide small enough sections to allow for the kind of discussion it believes fosters these goals? How can it schedule the entire freshman class into these small sections without exceeding the cap? How to gather enough qualified instructors for the number of sections needed? How can these courses keep the attention of a group of students with such diverse interests? In short, does the core accomplish what it sets out to do? Surprisingly, it does. According to Cathy Popkin, chair of Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), small class size is one of the keys to the success of the Core. ""Even in following the same syllabus as every other section, each section develops its own agenda,"" Popkin says. ""Because the classes are small and students stay together for a year, it becomes a joint project to make sense of these texts. Discussions are real, not canned."" Administrative Director of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly agrees. She notes that for the last couple of years the student to teacher ratio in Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization (CC) has been around 21:1. The sections are capped at 22, although occasionally, if a particular time period is in great demand, the numbers may rise to 23 or 24 students, but never more than that. ""The emphasis of these courses is on critical thinking, argumentation, and learning how to ask questions—things that come best working with peers in small groups,"" Gillooly said. Lan Bent, chair of Music Humanities, noted that when a section grows beyond 30 students it ceases to be a class discussion and becomes a lecture. According to Bent, the Music Hum program has worked very hard in the past several years to bring section sizes down, a task made more difficult with the growing number of College and General Studies students and the cuts to the music department's faculty and resources. ""In the past the sections have been as large as 32 or 33 students,"" Bent said. ""This year's absolute limit is 26. We've also increased the number of sections from 25 last year to 28 this year, mirroring the increase in enrollment."" The increase in section numbers obviously necessitates an increase in the number of instructors as well, but not all of these vacancies are filled by full-time faculty. Rather, the departments hire PhD candidates with all but their dissertations completed (ABDs) to teach many of the core sections. This semester, of the 55 Lit Hum instructors 27 are full-time faculty, 6 are Fellows, and 22 are ABDs. CC sections have a similar breakdown: 20 full-time faculty, 7 Fellows and 26 ABDs. Music Hum instructors are mainly grad students, who outweigh full-time faculty three to one. Does this indicate a decrease in quality of instruction for certain sections? 'To be completely honest, there is no difference between the level of instruction by PhD [candidates] and full-time faculty,"" Popkin says. ""People have this idea about sec-ond-rate grad students —it's not true."" Popkin notes several advantages that PhD candidates have over full-time professors. Because they only teach one section of the Core classes, they put all of their energy into teaching that section. Graduate student preceptors also have an extensive support network, with weekly seminars and discussions on the texts taught in their courses. . Gillooly adds that graduate student preceptors go through a rigorous selection process, and those chosen generally out-perform other grad students in their departments. ""They're very good teachers and they have the chance to show that here,"" he says. If the graduate student preceptors are the ""best of the best,"" as Popkin calls them, what about the full-time professors who teach core classes? Selected on a volunteer basisStanford University of Chicago 3 quarter sequence in the area of ""Cultures, 4 quarters of Humanities Ideas, and Values g q uar t er sequence of Civilizations 3 courses in the fields of Natural 2 quarters of Math Science, Applied Science, Technology, 6 quarters of Natura| Scjence and Math 3 quarters of Social Science 3 courses of humanities and Sequence Social Science 310 4 q Uar t e rs of foreign lan--2 of 3 sub-areas of World g uage Cultures, American 3 q Uar t ers 0 f physical Cultures, and Gender education Studies Harvard 8 of 10 course categories: 1.

Social Analysisfrom a wide variety of departments, none of the professors who teach the core are experts on the subject matter of the courses. When coupled with other teaching obligations and university commitments, the time they spend on preparation for their core classes can be limited. Whether or not this is reflected in the quality of their teaching is subject to debate. Wayne Proudfoot, professor of Religion, who has taught CC ten times during his years at Columbia, notes that his commitment to teaching thecore was as great as any of the courses he teaches within his field of expertise. ""I spent a lot of time on my CC section, more than on most other classes."" Proudfoot said. According to Professor of Classics Suzanne Said, who taught Lit Hum for the last 4 years, preparation for material outside her specialty is completely different than for classes she teaches in her department. ""You spend more time on what you don't know well,"" Said says.Kathy Eden, Professor of English and Comparative literature, has taught Lit Hum ""every chance [she's] gotten"" and looks at it as a unique and exciting teaching experience. 'Teaching a course in your expertise, you're very much in isolation,"" Eden says. 'Teaching Lit Hum, there is a kind of community of faculty and students, and the ways of teaching the texts are constantly evolving. Those are the richest teaching experiences for me. There is nothing else that compares to it."" Of course, the excitement of developing an intellectual community depends not only on enthusiastic instructors and small sections, but requires the involvement of the students as well. Instructors recognize the importance of this in the reasons they list for teaching core courses. Bent, who has taught Music Hum for 12 years, notes that ""teaching core courses, you can have a much bigger impact in bringing music to people."" Said mentions that the opportunity to reach students outside of her field was a major incentive for teaching Lit Hum for her. ""You have students for whom the material is quite fresh, and they react immediately to it,"" she explains. But do students, whose interests vary widely and often do not center on literature, philosophy, music or art, really have the same positive reaction to their core courses as their instructors? They seem to. ""The Core Curriculum was one of the reasons why I came to Columbia because 1 was interested in doing a double degree in natural and social sciences,"" says Shampa Bari, CC 'Ol. ""The Core Curriculum is a good basis from which to start."" Other students, while appreciating the Core, see its length and intensity as a sort of academic tough love. ""It does limit you in a sense, but it forces you to study things that you would not study for leisure,"" notes Katie Ng, CC 'O2. U I need to be forced."" In response to the notion that the core humanities courses are a good basis from which Columbia students can formulate interesting conversation at cocktail parties, Professor lan Bent calls upon the common sense of those who apply to Columbia. ""Why come to the most recognized core-based college in the country if that were true?"" Bent asks. The core is one of the best known and established parts of Columbia."" ""If you've graduated from Columbia you share a certain kind of educational experience that we as an institution endorse,"" Gillooly agrees. ""In the Core, knowledge is not just injecting one person's thoughts into another, but rather ideas are born. It's the combination of minds together."" —Additional reporting by Christian Kaufholz"
258,"University Profs. Eden, Griffis Named Great Teachers of 1998",16 October 1998,"By BENJAMIN LOWE Spectator Associate News EditorColumbia professors Kathy Eden and Fletcher Griffis were honored as the Great Teachers of 1998 at the 89th annual meeting of the Society of Columbia Graduates on Wednesday evening in the Faculty House. ""It's important to understand how crucial the faculty is to everything else we do,"" Dean of the College Austin Quigley said in his State of the College remarks. Eden, who joined the Columbia College faculty as a professor in 1980, currently serves as chair of the Literature Humanities program. Griffis joined the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) faculty in 1982 as an adjunct professor of civil engineering. He was appointed to a full professorship in 1986. The winners made brief comments after receiving their awards and said they werehonored to be included in the list of past winners, which includes professors William Theodore de Barry, Eric Foner, and Carol Gluck. ""It is very humbling to be among previous winners,"" Griffis said. In her acceptance speech, Eden said she has learned a lot from her Literature Humanities students. ""It didn't take me too long to discover that I would learn just as much as I would teach,"" Eden said. ""I look forward to the opportunity to learn from many great and wonderful students.""Quigley and SEAS professor Morton Friedman, who spoke on behalf of SEAS Dean Zvi Galil, spoke to the audience about the state of their schools. Quigley said the College has enjoyed an increased number of applications over a multi-ple-year period. ""Columbia College continues its remarkable progress on the national scene with more and more applicants,"" Quigley said. He added that the College receives about 1,000 more applications every.year. Friedman, who is also a winner of the Great Teacher award, said SEAS has also seen aincrease in the number of applications it receives each year, about 16 percent. Established in 1909, the Society of Columbia Graduates was formerly known as the Society of Older Columbia Graduates. Originally, an alumnus was eligible for the award 25 years after graduation. However, Steven Schwartz, CC '7O and chair of the Columbia College Fund, said eligibility for membership is now awarded by the amount of post-graduate service the candidate has done for Columbia. The eligibility requirement and the name were changed to accommodate the first female Columbia graduates, Schwartz said.Kathy Eden was one of the professors honored Wednesday."
259,Letters to the Editor,16 October 1998,"Spectator Probes Hairy Subject To the Editor: I feel it necessary to voice my dissatisfaction with the Roving Reporter [""Body Hair,"" Oct. 15]. I noticed that you did not represent the views of women who do not shave, nor did you ask any men if they shaved their legs. All this column served to do was reinforce archaic stereotypes of 'femininity' and 'masculinity.' This is also the first Roving Reporter I can recall that has only reported the views of Barnard students. Why is it that when the Spectator finally chooses to focus its attention on Barnard students, it's to examine their 'beauty' habits? Lauren Porsch, BC 'Ol Oct. 15, 1998 Barnard Intelligence Overlooked To the Editor: Due to my shock from reading the Roving Reporter [""Body Hair,"" Oct. 15], I hope I can adequately express my dismay at the Spectators approval of such a blatantly shallow depiction of Barnard students (who are very rarely acknowledged in the paper in the first place). First of all, if the goal of this ""report"" was to ask about the shaving habits of (presumably all) students, why were only Barnard women's responses to this inane topic printed? Furthermore, I'm sure the pro-shaving opinion was not the only opinion expressed. I have been a part of school newspaper publication and havedone a Roving Reporter before as well. Stephanie Bloomer, by interviewing only Barnard students, has not only failed standards of quality journalism (by not canvassing a variety of people and opinions), but has succeeded in portraying Barnard students as self-obsessed, petty ninnies. I think it's sad how only our identity confusion (i.e. the unflattering ""Barnyard"" subway-sit-uation cartoon that appeared a few weeks ago) and our possession of body hair has been important enough to print in the paper, and how our personalities and intelligence have been overlooked. Emily Glick, BC 'O2 Oct. 15, 1998 Colombian ... To the Editor: While for some people like Ms. Weintraub [""Colombia, Columbia: Shouting Out Her Name,"" Oct. 14] it is ""dissatisfying and confusing"" to say they ""go to Columbia,"" for others like me it is quite satisfying. I am a Columbia student from Colombia and I get awkward reactions when asked where I am from—some people get quite confused and think I am talking about the University or perhaps Columbia, North Carolina. The easy part is explaining that 1 am from Colombia the country. Then comes the explanation that it is spelled with an ""o"" and not a ""u"" and that it is in South America. Unfortunately some people are quite ignorant of Colombia, a country of nearly 38 million people, and their stereotypical knowledge islimited to its ""affiliation with coffee legend Juan Valdez"", ""Colombia's illegal cocaine trade,"" and in some cases its soccer players. Ms. Weintraub's article, is the perfect example: ""weYe perceived as drug exporters;"" ""Colombia's illegal cocaine trade profits reportedly worth well over $3OO million,"" and so on. She does a great job in communicating that knowledge in a responsible, professional manner (after all, we do partly owe those stereotypes to wonderful journalists) . Even though confusing, it is very satisfying to say that I go to Columbia and I am from Colombia. It gives me an opportunity to tell people like Ms. Weintraub more about Colombia and contribute to breaking those stereotypes. Besides, if for no other reason, shouldn't a member of the Columbia community be more familiar with a country that has a similar name to his alma mater? Alejandro Jaimes, GSAS Oct. 15, 1998 ... Columbian ... To the Editor, I would like to know what Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Colombia native and Columbia honorary degree recipient, would have to say about Sarah Weintraub's article [""Colombia, Columbia: Shout Out Her Name,"" Oct. 14]. Weintraub says, ""All that Colombia can take pride in is ... Juan Valdez."" I am sure the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature winner would be as shocked as I am to read an article so ""Columbia-centric"" as this one is, in a publication of aninstution that prides itself on its multi-culturalism. Weintrauab says, ""Rather than coming across as snobby Ivy Leaguers,we're perceived as drug exporters or worse yet.. I hope that I will be one among many to clarify that my ideal goal at Columbia is not, as Weintraub implies, to come off as a ""snobby Ivy Leaguer"", nor is my primary concern ""glory"", as the article also claims for all Columbia students. If our Literature Humanities vocabulary (Weintraub uses the word kleos in further justifying how ""our primary concern [is] glory"") is going to be used in articles that contain such ignorant bashing of other countries to show off that we are Ivy Leaguers, without a doubt I would rather be confused with a native Colombian than as a Columbian. Tanya Dantus, CC 'Ol Oct. 15, 1998 ... And Proud To the Editor, I was surprised at the minute level of maturity, vast ignorance, and uncalled for pretentiousness of Sarah Weintraub's article [""Colombia, Columbia: Shout Out Her Name,"" Oct. 14]. The frivolousness of it was surprising, even for a first-year brat, although this is not my point at all. 1 am from Colombia, a beautiful country overflowing with natural resources and a culture so rich, a Sarah Weintraub from Chicago would never even dream of. I was personally insulted by her television educated mind, droppingdrug and violence facts, and of course, (and I'm sure she thought this quite witty) her remark about Juan Valdez. Juan Valdez is a marketing strategy used only outside of Colombia, and the guy isn't even Colombian, he's Mexican. So Sarah, if you mean my country has nothing to be proud of except a Mexican in a mustache, I think you should refrain from writing publicly, because if you are not even planning on doing at least some common sense research for your articles, your lack of decency will only bring bad karma. Although it is clear the only pride in your life is attending an Ivy League School, you should respect the parts of your world that are unknown to you (I assume everywhere except Chicago and the Upper West Side of Manhattan.)

260,Letters to the Editor,25 November 1998,"Core Already Teaches Men's Studies To the Editor: In asserting that Columbia should offer Men's Studies, Mark Juszczak [""Up with Men's Studies,"" Nov. 17] forgets one thing. We already have such a program: it is entitled Literature Humanities, and it is required for all students regardless of gender, biological sex or any other such factor. From the Iliad's tale of repressed (or not-so-repressed) homosocial desire to Montaigne's obsessive ponderings of his penis and his inability to control its functions, Lit. Hum. is, as Eve Segewick brilliantly observed, a course about male relationships mediated through female figures. And let's not forget Contemporary Civilization, with Machiavelli's machismo and Freud's phallocentrism. But Columbia does offer a program for men who are interested in exploring the social constructions of masculinity. It's called the Women's and Gender Studies interdisciplinary major or concentration. Through the courses offered in Women's Studies, one can explore not just the matrix of identities of women but those of men as well. After all, men have always defined themselves socially in opposition to that ""terrifyingly unknown and unknowable Other,"" woman. And yet, for some reason, I am currently the only male major in Women's Studies to the best of my knowledge. Why is that? Why are so many Columbia men afraid to engage in a rigorous analysis of the society, culture, and political economy that made them as they are today? I can only surmise that it isbecause they are terrified of what they might find. But I certainly urge all Columbia students, women and men alike, to enroll in a Women's Studies course before they graduate. You might just learn something that could change your entire way of living. I certainly did. Simon Moshenberg, CC 'Ol Nov. 23, 1998 To the Editor: As a women's studies major at Barnard, and simply as an informed member of the general populace, I would like to point out the misinterpretations pervading Mark D. Juszczak's Monday column [""Up With Men's Studies,"" Nov. 23], Women's studies as a discipline evolved out of a desire to provide a forum for intellectual discourse on the specific experiences of women in society and in their personal lives. Juszczak, speaking as a man and presumably for men, expresses a desire for ""a forum where their distinct needs and experiences as men could be examined."" I'm sure he will rejoice to hear that his needs have been met, as this desire has been satiated through a forum that has existed for thousands of years. It is called society. I frankly don't think that anyone needs to be ""enlightened"" to the fact that ""there is a male culture"" out there. It is precisely because of the fact that men have remained at the center of every issue, in command of every political organization, in the pulpit in every house of worship, at the helm of every corporation, and at the head of every table that the need for such a focus on women has arisen. Higher education in general evolved to study ""the male experi-ence."" And while women's studies classes may indeed address topics commonly regarded as female issues, it is in the hopes of raising consciousness about them, and in turn offering a route to empowerment and change for all students, male and female. I can hardly see how advocating such a bland stereotype of ""the common experience of being male"" as Juszczak does jokingly (I hope) in his invention of the course, ""Men and Their Love for the American Automobile,"" is empowering. Juszczak also takes issue with the fact that what Columbia College curriculum terms ""gender studies"" in essence means ""women's studies."" Regardless of the terminology one uses to describe it, women's studies is not only about women. It is about the oppression and experiences of women in relation to men (as well as in relation to many other groups). For how can any study be truly comprehensive without a context to place it in? If men at Columbia are anxious to reflect on their ""aggressiveness"" and to ""channel their energies more positively,"" I would encourage them to take a women's studies course. There is significant literature about ""men and alcohol and violence."" We read it. Just because your gender isn't specifically identified in the title doesn't make it inaccessible or exclusionary.

261,Students Gather to Chat with Prof. Shapiro,3 December 1998,"By ELI LASSMAN Spectator Staff WriterIn a setting far removed from the formality of the Shakespearean world he specializes in, the popular English professor James Shapiro, CC '77, spoke with over 40 students at last night in Wien Lounge. Shapiro, who specializes in Shakespeare's plays, talked about his own years at Columbia, his hobbies and the influences on his life. The students at the second in a series of eight Wien Fireside Chats, many of whom are English majors or students of Shapiro's, asked questions that provoked serious and humorous responses. After a buffet dinner, Shapiro opened the evening by telling the students, who were lounging in couches, to ask him questions but say their names first. ""Ask what you want,"" he said, explaining that since students spend all day answering his questions, they deserved a chance to grill him. Shapiro described his high school career as less than exemplary. He attended four different high schools before he ended up at an experimental school. Nevertheless, he said, Columbia was willing to give him the opportunity to prove himself. Shapiro said Columbia's Core Curriculum had a strong effect on his life. After being raised in a very religious Jewish environment, he was ""fundamentally challenged"" by the reading for Literature Humanities, he said. Shapiro also recalled his experiences on the fencing team. When he first got to Columbia, he couldn't pass what was then a mandatory gym test. ""I swore I would revenge myself by making a varsity sport,"" Shapiro said. He joined the fencing team on which, he joked, he ""learned to lose on a regular basis."" On a more serious note, he credited his experiences on the team with help-ing deal with many aspects of his professional life. Shapiro's first teaching job was at an inner-city community college in Chicago, which he considers the most fulfilling teaching experience he has had. Shapiro then spent a year teaching at Goucher College, a small women's college in suburban Baltimore which he called a wonderful experience. He then applied for a job as a teacher of Shakespeare's work at Columbia. He received the position, and worked seven years before receiving tenure. Shapiro emphasized the importance of being able to write well. He said he has tried several times to establish a writing center on campus, which he is still working at. Summing up his feelings on writing, he said, ""The world would be a slightly better place if could write better.""Shapiro has strong opinions about how Shakespeare is being treated on stage today. ""What matters is not how Shakespeare is taught in the classroom; what matters is how it is performed."" He said he considers the current performances of Shakespeare to be some of the worst in the past 400 years. Shaprio responded to a question about what his favorite Shakespeare play is by saying, 'That's like asking ... when you were growing up, who your best friend was."" His favorites, he said, changed periodically. Sarah Dobesevage, CC 'Ol, said, ""Ifound him very impressive and dynamic."" She continued, ""He's encouraging because you know he cares about what he's doing."" ""He was so honest with us that it came across,"" Melissa Gaman, CC 'OO, said. ""He said the only reason he decided to do this whole Fireside Chat was that talking with professors just wasn't really done when he was at Columbia. Access to them just wasn't available."" Gaman said she found hearing about Shapiro's past interesting. ""He is always very human which is always very appealing about him, even when he's teaching,"" she said.English Prof. James Shaprio discussed his experience as an undergrad at CU at last nighfs Wien Fireside Chat."
262,Shopping Around for the Best Deals: Crafty Students Explore Options for Book-Buying,20 January 1999,"By SABRINA DEPETRO Spectator Staff WriterThe beginning of the spring semester gave way to the formation of long lines in both the Columbia Bookstore and neighborhood bookstores, as students venture out to buy new course books. Overcrowded bookstores, however, are not the only means of purchasing requiredtexts. Students continue to find new, innovative ways to do their ""book shopping."" Perhaps one of the most valuable sources for used books is the student body itself. With the onset of each semester comes a surge of flyers posted by students advertising used books at discounted prices, reminding everyone that miniature bookstores exist in numerous dorm rooms. This alternative often proves most affordable and convenient for the student with limited cash flow. ""I usually call the advertised num-bers. It's much better than going to the bookstore, and I wouldn't want to rely on downloading from the internet,"" Michael Wu, GS 'Ol, said. Along with flyers advertising used books, signs posted around campus inform students of advertising Websites from which they can download Literature Humanities (Lit. Hum.) texts. Although some mayfind these Websites valuable, others find fault with them. 'The Internet is not always a reliable source. Anyone who has a couple bucks to put up a Website can do it. No one checks the facts or if there are any errors and encryption can mess up words easily. You just don't know who is creating these Websites,"" Aja Starke, CC 'O2, said. The Columbia bookstore offers a boxset of Lit. Hum. books for $75, a 13 percent discount from the original price $87.55 in an effort to accommodate the demand for more affordableprices for Lit. Hum. books. ""I didn't get to buy them from the school bookstore at the bulk rate because there were only a limited amount and they sold really quickly,"" one Columbia College first-year said. The same student explained that spending money on Lit. Hum. books are not a great concern because they carry classical value. ""I feel I should own these books anyway,"" the student said.Long lines are forming in neighborhood bookstores as students shop for new course books."
263,College Eases Core Registration Problems,21 January 1999,"By DANIEL FELDMAN Spectator Staff WriterIn response to students' concerns about their inability to make changes in their Columbia Core Curriculum classes registration, the College has restored telephone registration to Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and Contemporary Civilization (CC). Students no longer have to change sections by written petition. Last semester's policy of requiring all Core section changes to be handled in writing was scuttled after the Core office became inundated with petitions and students expressed confusion about the various channels processing those petitions. ""The most compelling reason forthe switch was the volume of changes,"" Sophomore Class Dean Karen Chung said. ""It was just very difficult for that office to handle the number of petitions."" Eileen Gillooly, the Core's administrative director, said the policy of manual changes was too much of a strain on the department. ""It got quite complicated in ways that we felt did not help the students or anybody else,"" Gillooly said. ""The fact that students needed a dean's signature and then had to go from office to office made things very difficult."" Under the new system, students are encouraged to do as much as they can for themselves beforeseeking help from the Core office. ""If students help themselves, then 1 can be the person of last resort instead of being the person you speak to first,"" Gillooly said. Last semester's decision to require all changes in Lit Hum and CC sections to be handled manually was made after the College determined that all first-years should be required to take Lit Hum. The course had always been strongly recommended to first-years, but was not made a requirement until two years ago. Before the requirement was created, many first-years dropped Lit Hum, and the policy of manually processing section changes was created, officials in the Core office said. Gillooly said that, although students can try to register for a specific section over the phone, written petitions only accommodate time period changes. ""I don't think anyone is opposed to stu-dents trying to get into a particular instructor's section so long as it's fair game,"" Gillooly said. ""What I want to avoid is having 15 or 20 people trying to get into one particular section. Even if it's okay with the instructor to accept extra students, it might not be okay with the College, which advertises small Core sections."" CC instructor Graham Burnett said that he was willing to allow more students into his section than the 22-student cap allowed, but that the final decision rested with the Core office. ""I can accommodate students' requests, but I can't make any guarantees because the decision is ultimately not mine,"" Burnett said. ""My humanity cannot enter into this process. My spirit cannot be a factor here."" The number of petitions to the Core office has dropped significantly since the change. Last semester 830 petitions were submitted to Gillooly's office, including 260 on thefirst two days alone, while 150 have been submitted during the first two days of the current term. ""The [manual] system was frustrating for everybody. The lines were long, and people got confused,"" Gillooly said. 'The deans got swamped, and it was unnecessarily complicated and frustrating."" Dean Chung agreed. ""Since we'd like all first-year students to be in Literature Humanities, we are basically just helping them out by pre-registering them,"" Chung said. ""But there were complaints that it was a little difficult because they had to wait to make changes."" Under the current system, the registrar reports to the first-year office the names of College first-years who are not registered for Lit Hum, and the deans then contact the students. According to officials in the Core office, this new system to prevent first-years from dropping Lit Hum was an essential part of thedecision to return Core registration to the telephone system. Last semester, Core students often had to visit their section instructors, the Core office, the CC or Lit Hum directors' office, and their class deans' office before switching sections. ""It was just extremely hard,"" said Pam Mignone, CC 'OO, who petitioned to switch CC sections. ""It was almost impossible to switch a class. If you don't get something registered that fits in your schedule, you can't make any changes whatsoever. It just doesn't happen, especially with CC,"" said Mignone. Mignone went to six different sections and found each full and with students on a waiting list to get into the section. 'The professors were just so overwhelmed that when I walked in they just said, 'Sorry, we're full, try somewhere else,' or 'Go to the CC office,""' Mignone said."
264,"Online Bookstores Offer Savings, No More Lines",21 January 1999,"By SUNNIE KIM Spectator Staff WriterAs the spring semester begins, an increasing number of students at Columbia and other universities are going online to buy their textbooks from such Websites as textbooks.com, or Varsityßooks.com, rather than going to the Columbia bookstore or other area bookstores to stock up on textbooks. These online bookstores allow students to order any available textbook at discounted prices. All students need is a credit card number and a shipping address. At textbooks.com, students have the option of buying new or used books, if available. Also, the site offers a buy-back option for those who wish to return their books for at least a partial refund. Other online bookstores are working in conjunction with universities to facilitate the shopping process. Students can find their textbooks on Varsityßooks.com and efollett.com by selecting their university and course title. The required books and the name of the professor will automatically appear on the screen. Though it does not currently provide course-specific books for Columbia classes, Tim Levy, CC '92, and co-founder of Varsityßooks.com, said that his site will provide selections required by Columbia courses next year. Although Columbia students cannot currently specify their course selections online, they can select ""mega search"" and find their textbook by typing in the title, author, or keyword, Levy said. Efollett.com offers book lists from more than 450 institutions and hopes to increase that number to 585 universities by the end of February. Founded in December of 1997, Varsityßooks.com provides a textbook selection from over 45,000 individual courses. ""The beauty of our site is that students can choose from over 400,000 titles,"" Levy said. Although students who order online do not have to hassle with long lines or worry about not finding a particular textbook, they do have to consider shipping and handling fees. Efollett.com charges $3.95 per book for the first one and 95 cents for each additional textbook. Varsityßooks.com offers three different flat fees depending on where the student attends school. ""Most students from California and Hawaii choose the $17.95 fee because it offers them the best bargain,"" Levy said. In an effort to offset these shipping prices, online bookstores offer discounts on most textbooks. Varsityßooks.com offers a 15 to 40 percent discount on all new books while efollett.com discounts used books at 25 percent and provides customers with a five percent credit worth of their total purchase. One company, bigwords.com, offers up to a 40 percent discount with no shipping and handling fee attached for regular five-to-eightday delivery. Since most students shop for their books a few days before classes begin, they may worry about the expediency of these shipments. But Levy said this should not be a worry. ""Students in, say, New York can order online on Sunday and receive their textbooks by Thursday,"" Levy said. However, some students do not trust the shipping services provided by the online bookstores. ""Last year, I went into Amazon.com, and I paid 11 to 12 dollars in shipping fees to have the book delivered the next day. The book came a week and a half later, after my assignment was due. It's not reliable, and I don't like the idea of giving my credit card number away,"" Aja Starke, CC 'O2, said. All of the online textbook stores do not stock all novels and plays necessary for such courses as Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and Contemporary Civilization (CC). However, general online bookstores such as Amazon.com, which offers many books at discount prices, can solve that problem. Another electronic solution for locating all the required Lit Hum and CC texts has been provided by a SEAS student. He has developed his own Website, www.columbia.edu/~mbb32, where he allows students to download their second semester Lit Hum and CC books free of charge. ""I think it's ridiculous to pay $75 for course books when all of them are available free online,"" Matthew Blaschko, SEAS 'Ol, said, referring to the fact that classic works like the ones used for these Core classes are not pro-tected by copyright laws. But some students feel that the online solutions aren't as receptive or as personal as their own college bookstores. ""To walk around the bookstore is a magical experience, and the internet will destroy that intimacy,"" Ali Silverstein, CC 'O2, said. In response to this sentiment, Varsityßooks.com said it is beginning to place campus leaders on the front lines of a ""peer-to-peer"" effort to educate their fellow students about the opportunity to purchase the books they need for less money and with fewer hassles. Levy believes that online bookstores are the future. ""In the next three years, students will buy half of their textbooks online,"" Levy said. Eric Kuhn, CEO and co-founder of Varsityßooks.com, echoed these sentiments. ""Students are providing the momentum behind Varsityßooks.com. We have already sold to thousands of college students in every state,"" Kuhn said. According to Levy, the response to his and other online bookstores has been overwhelmingly positive. ""Education is expensive. College faculty and administrators all applaud any sensible innovation, like Varsityßooks.com, that can ease the financial burden on students and parents,"" Dr. Jacqueline Reich, assistant professor of European Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at the State University of New York at Stony Brook said. ""We've gotten e-mails from people saying 'you saved my life' and 'thank you, thank you, thank you,'"" Levy said.Many students like Laura Lattman, CC '01, are looking to Websites like Amazon.com to purchase their course books."
265,Registration For Art Hum Causes Jam,2 February 1999,"By DANIEL FELDMAN and ANDREW FORREST Spectator Staff Writer and Spectator Junior Staff WriterThe Art Humanities Office has been underestimating the number of Art Hum sections needed over the past four years, causing a registration logjam for the course, according to officials in the Art Hum Office. Professor Barry Bergdoll, director of the Art Humanities program, said the problem was unforeseeable, even though the first-year College class has increased from 838 to 956 since 1994 and the Art Hum Office has only added one more section over that period. During that time the official cap on Art Hum classes has remained at 24 students, making it difficult for students to register for, or switch, Art Hum sections. Other Core classes have added sections as the undergraduate class size has grown; Literature Humanities and Music Humanities each added three more sections in the past five years, and Contemporary Civilization has increased from 46 to 54 sections in that period. ""What we have done in the College and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to address the needs of students as we have progressed through Enlargement and Enhancement is to try to accomodate student demands,"" said Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis. ""I think we have been rather successful,"" she said. Art Hum instructors, however, think otherwise. ""It presents a real challenge to teach this course when there are 30 students in a class,"" Art Hum instructor Lynn Catterson said. Catterson's two sections of Art Hum have 29 and 25 students. ""They want Art Hum to be interactive, and it is challenging with a class of this size,"" Catterson said.""It makes field trips difficult if the instructor is short,"" she added. Yatrakis 'said enrollment in Music Hum and Art Hum classes can be difficult to predict since students may take them at any point in their Columbia careers. ""According to our calculations we add sections as needed,"" Yatrakis said. However, as the College has encouraged students to complete the Core during their first two years, the number of students in each Core section has steadily risen. Using a formula of dividing the total number of first-years by the number of Art Hum sections per semester, it is clear that the ratio of students to sections has increased significantly. In Fall 1994 there were 29 College students for every Art Hum section. This semester that number stands at 32 and including SEAS students the number has gone from 38 to 42 students per section since 1994. Since first-year students are now preregistered for Art Hum and Music Hum, as few as two spots per section remain for upper-class students to fill in classes where the cap is 24 students. Every Art Hum section this semester is full, and every one but those offered at nine a.m. are over the cap. The number of students per class peaked in the 1996-97 academic year, when 975 College first-years squeezed into 29 Art Hum classes, 55 Lit Hum sections, and 25 Music Hum sections. The following year, the College Class of 'Ol fell to 961, and two Music Hum sections and four Lit Hum sections were added. In 1997-98, SEAS reached a peak number of first-years, with 316. Last week, the Art Hum Office stopped students from registeringfor Art Hum so its staff could catch up with all the changes in enrollment that had been taking place since the start of the semester. The registration freeze was the result of an overload which occurred when an unexpected influx of students, who had not registered for Art Hum during early registration in November attempted to sign up for the course two weeks ago, according to Bergdoll. ""We weren't oversubscribed until the first day of class,"" Bergdoll said. ""Now it's hard to fix anything because we're already in the middle of the mess."" As a result of the increase in Art Hum enrollment, many sections exceeded their cap of 24 students per class. The Art Hum Office then told Art Hum instructors to freeze changes in their rosters and submit a final, uncapped roster at the end of last week.Bergdoll said the shuffling led to incorrect rosters and glitches in the automatic registration system. ""The problem is the chaos of people moving back and forth between sections,"" he said. ""It's an extremely imperfect system."" One problem is that many students retain spots in Core classes even after they plan to stop attending, according to Deputy Registrar John Carter. ""It's a concession to people who don't drop the course on time,"" he said, noting that shopping and Core classes can only coexist ""in a limited fashion."" ""I hate to reward the bullies and punish the pious, but we'll do it if that's convenient for students,"" Carter said. In Sept. 1998, the entering classes of both CC and SEAS leveled off from previous years' increases, at 956 and 299 students respectively.Core classes, such as this Lit Hum section, have grown in size since 1994."
266,Letters to the Editor,12 February 1999,"Women's Studies Provides Balance, Progressive ScholarshipTo the Editor: In the Feb. 10 edition of the Spectator Justin Shubow provides a scathing critique of Women's Studies [""Women's Studies = Sloppy Academics""] that is so seriously flawed it necessitates comment. A brief list of concerns only begins an adequate rebuttal. • 1) Shubow assumes a positivist definition of scholarship that ignores the work of philosophers such as Derrida, Foucault, and Althusser. If, as Foucault asserts, knowledge and power are intimately connected, then a critique of power is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; Women's [and Gender] Studies is dedicated to the integrity of this point of analysis. Shubow's attitudes perpetuate the marginalization of disciplines that critique scholarship itself. His suggestion that Women's Studies should remain subordinated to other disciplines shatters the autonomy of this unique and provocative lens. • 2) Shubow's methodology is not above reproach. He relies entirely on two sources, namely a panel sponsored by the New School for Social Research and a study by The Association of American Colleges. He failed to reference a single feminist scholar or Women's Studies' student and does not indicate that he himself has ever sat in a Women's Studies classroom or examined the discipline's curricula. His incomplete research and subsequent sweeping generalizations make his argument suspect, at best. • 3) Subow's use of negative allusions to ""Nazi anthropology"" and ""Soviet genetics"" degrades the tenor of the ""scholarly"" discourse in which he believes he participates. Evelyn Kircher, GS 'OO and Irene Xanthoudakis, BC 'Ol Feb. 11,1999To the Editor: The existence of Women's Studies departments is essential when nearly every other department bases its foundation on the works of men. An active Women's Studies department is the bare minimum a college should offer to provide a semblance of balance in modern higher learning. This is especially true at Columbia, where the works of the Core Curriculum and the names celebrated on Butler Library alike, remain dominated by white men. I would love to see the day when women's writings, perspectives, and history are fully incorporated into every department, from philosophy to physics. But at present, the women's studies department is not only necessary and appropriate, but vital to making this a legitimate, sensitive institution. The token additions of Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf to Literature Humanities, made when Columbia went co-ed in 1983, do not constitute any sort of full incorporation of feminism into the academic mainstream. Women's studies is not at all a representation of a single ideology, as Mr. Shubow assumes it to be. Women's studies—or feminism for that matter —is complex and replete with dissension, and highly contrasting opinions. In addition, the literature, ideas, history, and rights of women's studies, like those of ethnic studies, were fought for and earned in the civil rights movement, and will remain a part of the academy despite the efforts of those like Mr. Shubow. Though Mr. Shubow's attack on women's studies was extremely disturbing, it was not particularly surprising. If the author truly feels that women's studies can be described as ""bad sociology and bad psychology,"" or that women's biology is ""bad biology,"" what more could we expect than such sexist demands?

267,"Columbia University & Partners, Inc.",17 February 1999,"By LOUIS GROSSI Spectator Staff WriterYou thought Morningside Heights was selling out when Starbucks hit Broadway. Then the green mermaids came to JJ's Place. And with the arrival of the shimmering ATMs at Carman, it seemed that the school renamed itself Columbia University in the Citi of New York. What's the deal?Has Columbia sold out? Your ATM, your books, your sandwich, and your coffee — your everyday campus experience has been brought to you by the same companies that seem to provide the service everywhere else. The University claims that it is forming partnerships in efforts to improve services for students, but have those changes indeed improved the quality of life on campus? And why has the University chosen to outsource at what seems to be such an alarming pace? The Process Student Services maintains that there are three things that can be done to improve service to the Columbia community. It can improve the service itself, buy better quality products, or fQrm partnerships. When the University perceives a sufficient demand for a service it does not provide, it sends out a Request for Proposal (RFP) to inform companies that it is searching for an organization to provide that service. A typical RFP will meticulously state the facts of the proposed relationship, the technical andcontractual arrangements desired by Columbia, and any financial burden that the company may have to shoulder in order to get the deal. It took four to five months for Columbia to compose the RFP for potential booksellers to occupy the basement ofLerner Hall. It included, among other details, the squarefootage of the space the bookstore would occupy, issues of access, the estimated cost of fitting out the space, the number of sales the bookstore had recorded in the past, as well as information detailing the service delivery Columbia expects from a provider. In essence, the RFPs aim is to inform a potential partner what the University and its community want and expect from the service. The University strives to contact as many companies as it can to ensure competition and, therefore, the best offer and service that can be provided to students. ""Competition and options—choices—strengthens our position as much as possible,"" Mark Burstein, vice president of Student Services, said. ""So, I want as many companies as possible."" Providing the best service to students requires examining all the possible avenues available to Columbia and its students, as well as ensuring a competitive process to procure the best offer while maintaining high quality.Providing Better Service ""There are two basic reasons to enter into a relationship,"" Burstein said. ""One is to provide better service to the Columbia community. The other is to make money for the University."" It is Burstein's policy not to make deals with corporations if the sole objective is money. Many other institutions enter into exclusive deals with either Coca-Cola or Pepsi to provide soda on campus and limit students' choices, Burstein said. Those universities strive to make a profit by limiting the options available on campus. The contracts are financially rewarding, though, for both the company and a college but do not improve services on campus. Burstein questioned how those types of arrangements could benefit students by limiting the choices they have available to them. In order to provide the best service to students, he said there must be an emphasis placed on improving service and ensuring competition during the initial phase. ""I see my job at the University is to improve service delivery to students, and that is what motivates every decision we make at Student Services,"" Burstein said. Indeed, before forming contracts with outside companies, Burstein said that he and Student Services actively recruit the opinions of students, faculty, and the administration through surveys, focus groups, and advisory groups conducted throughout the year. People are not ashamed to tell him how they feel about Columbia and its services, and they provide him with ample feedback to evaluate the community's feelings towards certain services, according to Burstein. He further credits the Trading Places program, in which he switches roles with a student for a day, making him see the University through the eyes of students and how theyperceive student services. ""I feel very strongly that providing better service to students and the rest of the University is something that I should be thinking about every day,"" Burstein said, ""and if I can use tools that are outside this university, that is something that I should really try to call on in as creative a way as I possibly can.""Starbucks Before the übiquitous Starbucks coffee made its presence on Columbia's campus, Columbia bought the coffee served to students from a food provider called Ritter-Sysco. However, in a 1997 survey conducted by research market firms addressing food quality on campus, students and faculty answered questions concerning the quality of coffee and brands they preferred. The rating of the quality of coffee at Dining Services was very low.Discussions with the highest-ranked coffee company on the survey were initiated, and were contacted to prepare a proposal detailing how they planned to supply their product to Columbia. ""Starbucks was rated highest in that group,"" Burstein said. ""We then took the top three or four manufacturers in the rating—there were lots of different options, but we took the top three or four —and we started conversations with them about price and a host of other stuff."" Student Services thought upgrading the quality of coffee was an important step in improving the overall quality of food. ""We have really been trying to concentrate on improving the quality of food in Dining Services,"" Burstein said. In the end, Starbucks gave the best proposal, according to Burstein. However, its higher supply and service costs meant that Columbia would not make as much money on coffee as it had with the previous supplier. The coffee beans Starbucks provides for Columbia cost two dollars more per pound than the former brand. Not only are the beans more expensive but Starbucks' prescribed rules for serving its products require that coffee more than three hours old must be thrown out. This makes both production and labor more costly. Yet, Student Services is happy with the switch. ""Since we moved to Starbucks, sales are up over 20 percent for coffee,"" Burstein said. ""I'm probably not making as much on coffee sales across the campus as I did with my old brand, which was cheaper, but, on the other hand, quality was our goal."" Aramark According to Barnard Vice President for Finance and Administration Barry Kaufman, an RFP was issued for dining services at Barnard approximately 11 years ago when Aramark was chosen from a group of contenders. ""They're the professionals,"" Kaufman said. ""I'm not saying that we couldn't do the job. They ostensibly know how to market the program. They have access to some larger markets than we would in terms of buying, and maybe there are certain economies of scale that they can achieve."" Kaufman said that Aramark has the ability to move in managers and supervisors quickly to address problems, a task which is more difficult for Barnard because of its size. Barnard is charged a fee for using Aramark's service, which is incorporated into the price of the meal plan and in the prices charged for cash operations. ""Are they making a big profit?"" Kaufman questioned. ""It doesn't appear to be the case. And I assume if they were losing money that they would either look to somehow either change the terms of the contract or try to increase their fees."" Kaufman said there has been no attempt to increase the fees in the past couple of years. Last year the fee remained steady, the year before that it may have gone up about 2.5 percent, and the year before that it remained steady, he said. ""What we've tried to do is to work with Aramark to moderate the fee and to make sure that we can provide both a flexible and what we believe is a cost effective program for the students and on a cash basis for other who are using the program,"" Kaufman said. The agreements surrounding labor relations are between Aramark and their employees. Aramark provides the supervisors and the individuals who do the cooking, serving, preparing, and delivering of food. They are represented by the same union that represents Barnard's maintenance, housekeeping, and security staff, but the fact is that the contract is held between the workers and Aramark, Kaufman said."
268,Profs. Question Commitment to Core,3 March 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN Spectator Associate News EditorAs College enrollment increases, some professors are questioning whether having a larger school takes away from the University's dedication to the academics of Columbia College, particularly to the two classes at the center of its Core Curriculum, Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Because the College advertises the Core as its intellectual center, some professors say a lack of dedication to Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization could be seen as a lack of dedication to the College as a whole. Professor of English and Comparative Literature and former Associate Dean of the CollegeMichael • Rosenthal said the College's commitment to the Core comes from the number of senior faculty who teach in it. ""The extent of [administrators'] dedication to the Core can be measured by their willingness to commit senior teaching resources into it,"" Rosenthal said. ""It is not that easy to supply resources from the precious senior faculty. And it is that resource that measures their commitment to the Core."" Julian Clarence Levi Professor in the Humanities and current Literature Humanities Professor Andrew Delbanco agreed that the administration may not have a commitment to the Core Curriculum. ""The Core, like Social Security, is on a collision course with demographic reality,"" he said. ""The num-ber of senior faculty teaching Lit Hum is dismayingly small. Several are near retirement or already retired, and with the humanities side of the graduate school shrinking, the number of qualified graduate student teachers is also declining."" Delbanco continued by discussing how the University can increase its commitment to the Core Curriculum and the possible effects to the core if it fails to do so. ""If the University is to stand by its stated commitment to the Core, it must face these problems now. Incentives are needed for [senior] faculty to teach it. Otherwise, it is inevitable that sections will get larger and/or more numerous, relianceon adjuncts will increase, and the pressure to exempt students from taking it or to turn it into a lecture course will grow,"" Delbanco said. Other professors have another concern that senior professors cannot teach in the Core because their departments will not let them out of departmental major commitments. ""It can be said that [their respective departments] are unwilling to let big professors into a Core class, taking them away from graduate and upper-class students,"" Literature Humanities Chair Cathy Popkin said. David Johnston, chair of Contemporary Civilization and a professor in the Political Science Department, disagreed. He said the University, while it did not provide incentives in the past, is hoping to increase the incentive for senior faculty to teach in the Core. ""Up to this point, in the last three years, there have been no incentives for senior faculty to teach in the Core,"" he said. ""All senior faculty teaching in the Core in the past has been completely voluntary."" However, he continued, ""There has been a recognized desire to have more senior professors to teach to underclassmen, because of the increase [in the number of students enrolled in the College] as well as the decrease [in students enrolled in the Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences], But also because of the University's public and announced greater commitment to the core."" Popkin said that the desired percentage of teachers of core sections is one-third senior faculty, one-third junior faculty, and one-third graduate preceptors. ""[Those percentages] are sort of a fiction or a dream now,"" she said. In the 1998-1999 academic year,senior faculty accounted for 23 percent of Literature Humanities sections, following a seven-year high of 26 percent in the 1997-1998 academic year. About 18 percent of Contemporary Civilization sections were taught by senior faculty last year, according to Eilleen Gillooly, director of the College.Contemporary Civilization sections with senior faculty peaked in 1994-1995 at 25 percent. The low during this seven year period of sections taught by senior faculty in Literature Humanities was 15 percent in 1994-1995, and a low of 15 percent in 1993-1994 in Contemporary Civilization. Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said College administrators never decided on a specific number of senior professors who would teach the core in light of Enlargement and Enhancement. ""When Enlargement and Enhancement was planned and really shaped, there was a commitment made to an average [of students in each core class] not over 22,"" she said. ""There was not a specific commitment to percentage of faculty."" The average number of studentsin both Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization section has not exceeded 22 in the last seven years, and this year is 20.5 in Literature Humanities sections, accordiitg to Gillooly. Yatrakis said that in order to increase, or at least keep constant, the percentage of senior facultyteaching in the core, two things can happen: ""An increase in the number of faculty teaching in the core, and/or hiring additional faculty to come in and teach the core,"" she said. She also said that the College has an increasingly acute desire to attract senior faculty to teach core classes. ""We are now thinking about how we can assemble some sort of plan to bring faculty [into the core],"" she said. Yatrakis said that over the academic life of a professor who teaches in the Core, his or her benefits may include money for reasearch assistants, a summer stipend for research, and a named chair. There is a current move to increase these incentives, Yatrakis said. ""We would like to put together a whole package of beliefs thathonor the people who teach in the core,"" she said. Specfically, she said there is a greater move toward establishing more chaired professorships, and that a Core Endowment Fund was established one year ago. Some professors disagree on the effectiveness that an increase in the number of chairs may have. ""Giving chairs to professors teaching in the Core for a while definitely gives an increased prestige and recognition [to the professor],"" Popkin said. But Rosenthal said, ""Raising chairs for faculty who teach the core is not in itself going to make teaching in the core more attractive to senior professors."" These incentives that may attract senior faculty into the core are still being planned and have yet to be finalized, Yatrakis said. Yatrakis added, however, that the numbers of senior faculty teaching the core are not as important as the academic experiences that students have in their core sections. ""What we need to focus on is the quality of the education,"" she said. ""We need to be concerned about the [academic] outcome; we're looking at the end product."" This desire for good academics supercedes any notion of a desired number of senior faculty teaching in the core, she said. David Johnston agreed with Yatrakis. ""The idea is not to get senior faculty in the Core, but to get excellent teachers,"" he said. ""The miracle of Columbia is that in a University that has historically been concerned with graduate education, we have at the same time managed to create and support the College's unique core curriculum. But the bias toward graduate education remains,"" Rosenthal said."
269,The Growing Lion Is Five Years Old How the Program Of Enlargement & Enhancement Has Changed Columbia,3 March 1999,"How the Program Of Enlargement & Enhancement Has Changed ColumbiaBy LAURA HERTZFELD Spectator Associate News EditorAlmost 3,600 Columbia College undergraduates stroll down College Walk every day. It is these 3,600 students who need adequate housing and financial aid, smaller classes and experienced professors —especially because this 3,600 will soon number 4,000.The University is approaching the culmination of its ambitious plan to make the undergraduate experience the focal point of this once-powerhouse graduate research institution. Begun in 1992, it was this Enlargement andEnhancement initiative that called for a dramatic restructuring of the College and undergraduate life in general. Students can already see the benefits of this program in the University's infrastructure: long-needed renovations to Butler were completed for the beginning of this academic year and the new $B5-million student center, Alfred Lerner Hall, will be opening when students return from spring break. But despite these physical improvements, the University and Columbia College still find themselves in the preliminary stages of academic enhancement, evidenced by overcrowded classes, slow faculty hiring, and less of a focus on improving academic resources. ""Most of the initial investment had to go to things [in terms of infrastructure] that were broken and had to be fixed,"" University President George Rupp said. However, in terms of academics, he said, ""We have not managed to domore than retain previous levels."" Enlargement and Enhancement, a revenuebuilding program that has so far cost Columbia over $3OO million, has nearly doubled the size of the College in seven years. Begun almost seven years ago by a strategic planning commission created by the University, the program's goal was to determine how best to increase the enrollment of the College and place greater focus on undergraduate education. Administrators say this would create, in turn, an applicant pool of higher standards and positively affect Columbia's reputation across the country. ""We want to make Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale viewed by the public as the best [schools] in the country,"" University Provost Jonathan Cole said. The College received almost 13,000 applications this year with a target acceptance rate of 13 percent, making the class of 2003 one of the most selective ever to be admitted to the College. However, Columbia's U.S. News & World Report ranking of 10th in the nation leads one to question how a school with such competitive academics can be shut out of the top five. The primary reason is simple: money. Why Enlarge the College? Columbia is tuition dependent, and is, according to administrators and faculty alike, underendowed. The current endowment of the University is almost $3.5 billion, a significantly lower number than Harvard's $l3 billion or Yale's, which is over $6.5 billion, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. The University administration wants to create better facilities and make undergraduate students enjoy campus life to a greater extent and, at thesame time, to keep academics at an increasingly competitive level. Along with making all these improvements, a long-term goal of the administration is to increase alumni giving. By improving life for undergraduates, years and years down the road these students will be more likely to give money back to the University as donations. ""Undergraduate alumni feel the deepest loyalty to the University,"" Rupp said. The first prioritv of the administrationa ix\_ in ol ±ji iui icy ui tut auiiuiiiou aiiwii in accommodating the increasing number of students has been infrastructure. Cole said the improvements have, for the most part, been financed by gifts, debtfinancing, and internal reallocation of funds. The additional tuition money has been put to use in hiring additional staff, in addition to completing Lerner and the newBroadway residence hall. ""We want to make the physical environment superior. We have invested over $3OO million in physical upgrades: Lerner, Butler, and Internet wiring,"" Cole said. Cole said the additional tuition has not funded these projects. ""Not one dollar of the Butler renovation or the renovation of Furnald came from additional tuition money,"" Cole said. Admissions Enrollment has increased from approximately 850 students per matriculating College class five years ago to a goal of 955 students for next year's first-year class. The incoming class will have 1,005 students by the time Enlargement and Enhancement is completed, administrators said. Cole continued to emphasize, however, that the main goal of Enlargement and Enhancement has been to increase the quality of the applicant and matriculant pool, which has been increasing at a phenomenal rate, as Columbia is currently a""hot"" school, Cole said. ""Seven years ago, we had 6,500 applicants for 850 spots, now we have 13,000 applicants-15,000 with SEAS-for 955 positions,"" Cole said. The intellectual atmosphere of the College has improved along with the increasing applicant pool, Cole said. ""There is a noticeable improvement,"" Cole said. ""So much is learned from the interaction between and among students. This a tremendous part of enhancement."" The increase from 850 to over 950 students in each College class over the last several years shows that the administration has been successful in increasing the size of the College significantly. And despite these increases, Rupp and Cole said Columbia will still remain the smallest College in the Ivy League, even after Enlargement and Enhancement is completed. ""We're not a lot smaller than Brown or Dartmouth, but we are still smaller,"" Rupp said. However, administrators disagree with faculty when they"
270,Prof. Hiring Lags Behind Increasing Enrollment,5 March 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN Spectator Associate News EditorA 4.5 percent increase in the number of points undergraduates registered for per semester from the 1994-1995 academic year to the present was not met with a corresponding increase in the number of full-time faculty at Columbia, VicePresident of University Arts and Sciences David Cohen said Wednesday. Cohen said that two-thirds of the 4.5 percent increase was directly due to Enlargement and Enhancement, but University administrators maintain that due to the decrease in the number of graduate courses, the number of fulltime faculty did not have to increase. Columbia made the decision to start reducing its graduate schools in the early '9os. The average number of registered undergraduate points is the best indication of the effect the increase in the number of undergraduates is having on the faculty size, Cohen said. Cohen warned that developing a ratio of the number of full-time faculty and the number of undergraduates neglects instances where faculty teach to both graduate andundergraduate students. Chair of Contemporary Civilization and Professor of Political Science David Johnston said the University is experiencing ""growing pains"" due to Enlargement and Enhancement and ""shrinking pains"" due to the decrease of the Graduate School. Johnston said that the University felt it did not necessarily need to increase the number of full-time professors to keep pace with the increase in undergraduates because more professors would be free to teach undergraduates with the decrease in the enrollment of the Graduate School. ""The faculty-student ratio has decreased somewhat,"" he said. ""But it is important to think about that with the adjustments in the size of the graduate school [and not just focus on the increase in undergraduate enrollment]."" Johnston said that the entering class of the Political Science Department in the graduate school is 25 students, compared to ""a class of over 60 students a few years ago."" With the reported problems in overcrowding of classes in departments such as Economics, Political Science, and Psychology, the effectiveness of this plan has come into question. While there may be enough pro-fessors in departments such as Political Science to avoid overcrowding and the use of high numbers of graduate students for teaching duties, Johnston said that the departments have not developed new curricula that correspond to the changes in enrollments of the schools. ""In the early 90's there was a move to decrease the size of the grad school,"" he said. ""But the Political Science curriculum has really not caught up. We have not adjusted the roles of faculty [and asked professors to replace their graduate classes with undergraduate ones]. Department offerings have not fully adjusted yet, so we are getting some dysfunctional consequences."" Chair of Political Science Jack Snyder said that the decrease in graduate students ""is allowing us to shift our teaching efforts toward more undergraduate courses,"" he said. ""We've just formed a faculty committee to plan the next steps in this shift to increased emphasis on undergraduate teaching. As a result of this, we hope to be using fewer adjunct faculty to teach undergraduate courses."" He continued, 'The area of the greatest mismatch between student demand for courses and faculty size has been in the field of American politics. We are trying to remedythis imbalance by hiring additional senior faculty in this area. Johnston also attributed problems with overcrowding in under-graduate classes to the recent move to decrease the graduate schools. Graduate schools, he said, have not experienced the full brunt of the decrease because large classes that were enrolled before the decrease still remain. Both Cohen and Johnston said that some overcrowding problems have come from departmental failure to anticipate their extreme popularity as majors for undergraduates. ""Some of these large departments failed to anticipate an increased demand, so we get overcrowding,"" Johnston said. Cohen agreed and said that it is difficult to quickly redistribute funds to popular departments for extra professors. ""It is extremely difficult to make rapid adjustments [to numbers of faculty], and it is very difficult to predict where students will go,""Cohen said. Professor Emeritus James Mirollo, who has taught Literature Humanities for 30 years, attributed the problem to the University's desire to keep prominent senior faculty teaching graduate students. ""[The University] is not going to allow senior faculty members who are spectacular from a national point of view to be free of their graduate dedications,"" he said. The desired trend for more professors to teach in undergraduate classes is affected by the numbers of professors available to teach them. Cohen said that each department has Central Teaching Requirements. These requirements fall into three categories: Core classes, classes for undergraduate majors, and graduate classes. The departments' first priority is to fill their classes in these three fields with full-time faculty. Any shortage in professors in these fields would be of first concern, Cohen said. Because of this system and the fact that the College does not have its own faculty, departments must ask some of its professors to teach both graduate and undergraduate students. Because this system is only a few years old, Cohen said, the departments are still adjusting to these requirements. This interplay between the graduate and undergraduate schools did not begin with the inception of Enlargement and Enhancement and the program to decrease the number of graduate students. For years, Columbia was considered to be more focused on graduate education than undergraduates. Cohen said that there has been an active move to get away from that idea. ""The goal has been to regain an appropriate balance between the two,"" he said. ""We want undergraduates to be closer to the center of the radar."" Johnston said that the graduateschools, the undergraduate schools, and the research aspects of the University all must work in tandem. ""The college benefits from the Graduate Schools, and the College benefits from the research orientation of the University,"" he said. ""There is an organic relationship between them; either they thrive together or they languish together. The trick is to get all to thrive together."" Johnston also said that the research aspects of the University may cause professors to be more oriented toward research than their pedagogy. ""There is a strong , commitment to maintaining a faculty of world eminence,"" he said. ""This does not necessarily give the optimal teaching body for undergraduates, but it does not necessarily do the opposite."" A recent concern has been the overcrowding in economics classes. Rupp said that ""we all want to find good professors; everyone is aware that economics needs faculty."" Cohen attributed specific problems in the Economics department to under-staffing. ""Problems in the Economics Department were due truly to a staffing problem,"" he said. ""They had lost a number of faculty, and they had trouble replacing them, considering the expectations for the level of Columbia faculty in mind. We can always get bodies in there, but we want one of the best economics departments in the country."" Cohen said the University has offered 11 professorships, six for junior and five for senior faculty. Overall, Cohen said that until both Enlargement and Enhancement and the program to decrease the graduate schools are completed. ""Everybody will take their lumps until the treatment works,"" Cohen said.""Everybody will take their lumps until the treatment works."" —David Cohen vice president of University arts and sciences"
271,Construction Causes Delay In Opening of Bookstore,25 March 1999,"By DANIEL FELDMAN Spectator Staff WriterBooks already line many of the shelves in the Barnes & Noble bookstore in Lerner Hall, scheduled to open the week of Apr. 12. Administrators hope the new store will greatly enhance the convenience of obtaining books and redefine the role the bookstore plays on campus. The scheduled opening was pushed back several weeks because of construction delays. A lack of access to the University bookstore, which will be entered via an opening in the scaffolding at Broadway and 115 th St., held up the store's opening, as construction on the sidewalk outside Lerner took longer than expected, bookstore officials said. The bookstore, located in Lerner's basement, will be the first active segment of the $BB million student center, the rest of which will remain closed until August. Bookstore officials have already closed the Engineering, Law, andBusiness bookstore on Amsterdam Ave., and moved many of the books out of the Lion's Court location, though Lion's Court will remain open until Apr. 9, three days before the Lerner store is to open. The Apr. 12 opening will mark a ""soft opening,"" an initial trial phase before the Apr. 28 grand opening, when a ribbon-cutting ceremony will officially open the store, according to bookstore officials. For the last several weeks, bookstore workers have stocked many of the new store's shelves, including most of the store's 80,000 nontextbook titles. Twenty-five-thou-sand of such trade titles were in the old Ferris Booth Hall bookstore, while the Lion's Court store has had no trade section. The number of textbooks will increase from 3,000 to 4,000. The bookstore also includes spaces for author readings, books by faculty authors, and books published by Columbia UniversityPress. Eighteen registers are available to accommodate increased checkout traffic during peak times at the start of semester and a special section will be designated for Core books. Officials who planned the new bookstore said they wanted to establish the bookstore as a resource that supports students and faculty. ""We wanted to more directly link the bookstore to what's going on around campus,"" Vice President for Student Services Mark Burstein H said. The bookstore will feature a faculty display, highlighting individual faculty members and an array ofbooks they select, as well as seasonal displays. Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said the bookstore will also work in conjunction with specific academic programs, such as the Chemistry Department's Chem Write program, which promotes seminal books about science. This fall, the bookstore plans to begin accepting orders over the internet, Burstein said. Students will also be able to buy Literature Humanities books as a package. Textbook Manager Kevin Boyce said that the increased space will allow the bookstore to woo back customers that may have been turned away by the cramped quar-ters in Lion's Court. At 19,000 square-feet, Lerner's store is almost four times the size of the 5,000-foot Lion's Court space. ""We want them all back,"" Boyce said. ""We just want to take it back to the status it was back in Ferris Booth."" Burstein said that the bookstore is designed to complement, rather than replace, existing bookstores in Morningside Heights. He said that the store will not carry children's or educational books since area stores already specialize in those areas. ""We wanted to complement existing resources and work on our own customer service,"" Burstein said. ""Labyrinth is a very different type of store.""The opening of Columbia's Barnes & Noble campus bookstore was delayed due to construction. The Lerner Hall store will open on Apr. 12."
272,"Lover of the Core, Great Art, and Scrappy Students, Tayler Still Teaches after 39 Years",8 April 1999,"By DAVID COLBERT Spectator Associate Features EditorSince 1960, Edward Tayler, Columbia's Lionel Trilling professor in Humanities has been a fixture at the University, teaching Shakespeare, Literature Humanities, and other classes in 16th and 17th century English literature. The crowds that attend his first Shakespeare class every semester, packing the classroom on the sixth floor of Hamilton Hall, attest to the popularity of the class. The return of many students who have already taken one half of the two-semester course demonstrates the dedication many students feel towards the teacher, who enjoys referring to himself as ""your little, elderly Shakespeare Professor."" Those who take the class, whom he enjoys addressing with, ""Oh, beneficiaries of the Core,"" do so despite his warnings and pleadings to consider learning Shakespeare with Professor Howard or Shapiro. He describes his ""Mickey Mouse midterm,"" which consists of 100 fill-in-the-blank questions, and his final exam, which includes up to 80 quote identifications and five short essays. He speaks softly, slowly, and in a monotone lecturing voice that rarely varies by more than half an octave, 'Trust me. I am pedantic. I am boring. This class is no fun at all. Ask anyone who has taken it before."" Before cutting students from the class, after apologizing for the University's policy of ""enhancement,"" he adds, ""Remember, when the weather gets nice, don't riot in front of Hamilton Hall. Nobody cares about Hamilton Hall,"" then points suggestively toward Low Library. Those students that remain in the class discover that, in fact, it is not always fun, and that Tayler's lectures can be hard to follow on a sleepy and sunny Thursday. Yet, some students, both former and current, say they sometimes find themselves pondering those lectures for days after, piecing together the seeds Tayler has implanted in their heads. Born in Berlin, Germany, the Shakespeare professor spent some time in London, and most of his youth in New Jersey, ""[riding] a lot of horses."" From there, he says, ""I was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy to shape up, where I rode cavalry with some distinction and then was kicked out."" Why did Tayler get kicked out of military school? ""It's a long story, but I was bad person.... I would go at night and eat hamburgers.... The colonel said we'd get syphilis, and even at my young age I couldn't believe that. He thought we were doing something else. I said, 'from hamburgers, sir?'and that got me solitary confinement."" Still, he managed to go on to earn an M.A. from Amherst College and a Ph.D. from Stanford. All the while, Tayler said, he had to work in a sheet metal factory at night, from midnight to 8 a.m. to pay his bills. The need to make money (""I had five kids,"" he explained.) led him to accept a position at Columbia. ""I had always said I would never go to a university. I was going to a college, like Amherst.... Then I was offered a job at Columbia, changed all my principles and came here."" It wasn't until after several months of teaching at Columbia that Tayler discovered who the man was that he was replacing, and the indirect cause of his hiring was Charles Van Doren, son of Shakespeare professor Mark Van Doren, who was fired for participating in the rigged gameshow. The $64,000 Question, the subject of the movie Quiz Show. Still, Tayler has no regrets about teaching at Columbia. In fact, he said, ""I don't think there is a better place to teach than Columbia in the United States."" He said that over the years, the quality of students has vastly improved, with the single biggest factor being the admission of women starting in 1983. However, Tayler becomes visibly upset any time he talks about the trend of academia turning into a business. ""People, mainly administrators, make a huge amount of money out of education now... Low library used to be almost empty when I came here in 1960, and the number of administrators has increased like lemmings. So we have more students and more administrators and fewer professors,"" Tayler said. He acknowledges that the administration is sincere in its efforts to improve Columbia. ""It's a category which I have nowthat I call sincere hypocrisy. That is, these people are sincere, but they don't know doobly squat about education. And the people who do have ideas about the Core and Logic and Rhetoric are either not heeded, or are shoved to the periphery."" He said that Columbia, ""since the days of the senility of Nicholas Murray Butler,"" is notorious for being poorly run, as compared to universities like Harvard or M.1.T., whose teaching is inferior. Tayler notes another trend which can hinder students' education. ""Theory is the big difference.... A lot of the traditional subjects have been pushed out, and instead you get Prospero the Neo-Colonial Imperialist, taking over from that nice fella Caliban,"" he said. The reason to study Shakespeare and the only way to ""get your money's worth"" is to ""focus on difference. On the alien mind. On where Shakespeare's mind doesn't work the way your mind works,"" Tayler said. Tayler backs Columbia's Core Curriculum because, apart from allowing students to ""forget the same things, instead of different things,"" it forces students to do take challenged that they might otherwise avoid. Tayler says that Logic and Rhetoric, a course which he designed, taught, and used to run, is another crucial way to improve students' thinking. After nearly 40 years of teaching atColumbia, Tayler has given some thought to retiring. ""I was determined to do it. [I said], as I decline into the veil of tears and years I shall go to some nice small college and play it out. But a few of my friends said, you're some kind of idiot... you like to teach. Go teach. And don't go to any of the meeting, and don't talk to the administrators. And I said 'gee that's a splendid idea,' and I've been going on in that mode ever since."" However, for students who witnessed Professor Tayler's recent bout with a flu virus early in the semester, and his efforts to teach his classes while fighting off fever, dizziness, and trips to the hospital, it is hard to imagine he would want to give up teaching soon.Tayler said he enjoys teaching so much that he cannot name one single highlight in his career. ""The whole thing has just been one great highlight for me. When my colleagues complain about salary, I endear myself to my colleagues by saying Well hey, look, if I had an independent income, I would pay Columbia to be allowed to do this.' All the time I get to go into class and talk about great works of art with bright, scrappy students... I get to have enthusiastic, young minds, listening to me on a daily basis, and then someone asks me 'hey, can I write a profile on you?'.... Naturally one should pay to be able to do this.... It's tiring but exhilarating.""Edward Tayler is Columbia's Lionel Trilling Professor in Humanities. ""People think there's money that comes with that chair. This is not true,"" he says."
273,C olio quia May No Longer Be Offered,14 April 1999,"By NINA WILLDORF Spectator Staff WriterA 67-year-old tradition at Columbia College is being quietly buried—so quietly, in fact, that administrators are reluctant to talk about it. For many faculty, alumni, and students, the financial reasons being used to justify cutting the Colloquia—Core classes started in 1932 that inspired Literature Humanities —disrupt their notion of what Columbia's educational priorities should be, and create a sense of urgency in trying to save an academic legacy. In the words of famed Columbia College graduate David Denby, this seems to be ""just the wrong way to go."" What are Colloquia? Interdisciplinary, team-taught seminars for qualified upperclassmen, the Colloquia were intendedto be extensions of the Core, giving students the opportunity to explore topics outside of their major in their last two years at Columbia. The Colloquium on Important Books was first introduced in the College during the 1932-33 school year. The two professors teaching the course specialized in differentdisciplines and compiled a reading list with the students, often integrating such fields as English, Philosophy, History, Greek, Latin, Economics, Anthropology, and Political Science. Some of Columbia's most noted professors were the first to teach Colloquia: Jacques Barzun, Lionel Trilling, Mark Van Doren, Moses Hadas, and Raymond Weaver. After the course became more popularamongst both students and faculty, the faculty authorized an expansion of the program, creating a new required sequence: Humanities A and Humanities B (now called Literature Humanities). The Colloquia are one of the few forums at Columbia that promote inter-disciplinary studies. For many seniors who find themselves in large major-specific classes by the end of their four years, the Colloquia have been a rewarding way to round out the Columbia Core experience and reunite with classmates from other disciplines. And because they are the only classes at Columbia College where both faculty and students must apply to participate, the Colloquia provide a rare opportunity to be learning from, and with, people whowant to be there. Some colloquia that have been offered in recent years are ""Development of the Citizen and the Welfare State,"" ""Medicine and Civilization,"" ""Humanity and Human Rights,"" and ""Race and Representation: Jewish identity in Modern European Literatures."" For Justin Shubow, CC '99, who is currently enrolled in the Colloquium, the class fills a void in his philosophy major. ""There's only one seminar in my department, so I don't get a chance to take this sort of class,"" he said. And as for the opportunity to cross the boundaries between disciplines, Shubow said, ""I'm a philosophy major, but I still want to read literature."" J.C. Sylvan, CC '97, who took the Colloquium when he was a student in the College, described it as ""the best thing at Columbia for humanities students."" Students like English major Juliet Ross, CC 00, who had hoped to take a Colloquium next year, are upset at the prospect of losing the Colloquia. ""I am disappointed,"" she said. ""It would help me integrate my studies in the Core and in my major, and would give me a sense of having a more complete understanding of things. I think it will be harder to create that experience for myself without the Colloquium."" Colloquia Today From an administrative economic point of view, the Colloquia are not very cost-efficient; two professors teaching 15 students adds up to what Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen called ""an inefficient deployment of resources."" By not having its own department, the Colloquium Committee does not have a discretionary budget or departmental protection. Without its own budget, the Committee draws on money from either the dean of Columbia College or the vice president of Arts and Sciences, who is responsible for the budgetary decisions for 28 departments of instruction in five schools. Professor of English and Comparative Literature Steven Marcus, CC '49, has a unique vantage point on the issue, having been the first and only person to simultaneously be dean of Columbia College and vice president of Arts and Sciences, from 1992 to 1995. In 1995, Austin Quigley became dean, and David Cohen became vice president. In his two roles, Marcus made both the financial and academic decisions for the College. Now that the two positions are unlinked, the dean of the College does not have the same degree of budgetaryauthority or autonomy. The separation of these two roles has created the crack into which the Colloquia seem to have fallen. Since 1995, as the undergraduate community has expanded through Enlargement and Enhancement, and the Administration has restructured itself, the problems that the Colloquia are faced with have turned financial. The fear that many faculty and alumni have is that the financial reasons being used as the justification for eliminating Colloquia could be easily transferred over in the future to the Core. The fear that many students have is that economic decisions are taking precedence over educational ones. James Shapiro, professor of English and Comparative Literature and chair of the Colloquium Committee, said, ""I'm also concerned that the economic argument against funding the Colloquia could be used down the road against Core courses—which, by the same logic, are also not cost-effective. At some point educational priorities need to be recognized."" David Denby, CC '65, whose 1996 book Great Books helped bring critical acclaim to Columbia's Core Curriculum, also expressed wariness toward the administrators' use of cost-effectiveness as the criterion for academic decisions. ""In general, I'm against hurting anything that makes Columbia special on the basis of cost-efficiency,"" Denby told the Spectator. Justin Shubow said that his four years in the College have shown him that ""all this University seems to care about is money."" The Decision Makers After trying unsuccessfully to find someone in Low Library to say ""you came to the right place"" rather than ""you're talking to the wrong person,"" it became clear just how and why this program may no longer be offered. When pressed, Cohen, Provost Jonathan Cole, and Associate Dean of Columbia College Kathryn Yatrakis all admitted to having seen the issue cross their desks, but no one accepted full responsibility for a decision about the Colloquia or even affirmed that any decision had been made at all. ""We're still struggling to find out where authority comes from,"" said Professor Shapiro. Provost Cole explained that administrative authority over the Colloquia comes from three places: Vice President David Cohen makes budgetary decisions; Dean Quigley makes budgetary and academic decisions; and the Committee on Instruction (COI) makes academic decisions. Though Cole said that he reviews all budgets, he ""would not be reviewing on an annual basis proposals for courses or requests to offer courses."" He then added, ""in fact, I would have nothing to do with the Colloquia."" Though Provost Cole's role as chief academic officer entitles him to review and question all the budgets and academic plans from the individual schools, in response to a request for information about where the decision is made, he said ""I wish I couldhelp you, but,those issues just don't come across my desk."" Provost Cole handed the power of the proverbial red pen over to Vice President Cohen and Dean Quigley. ""[The issue] is clearly in the realm of the College and the Arts and Sciences."" Yet, in response to a request for an interview, Vice President Cohen, through his administrative assistant, said that he was ""the wrong person to talk to."" Only in person, confronted with the directional information that Provost Cole had provided, did Cohen admit that his budgetary decisions affected the Colloquia. The effect of those budgetary decisions clearly makes him the right person to talk to. Cohen said that no definitive decision has been made but that ""there has been a discussion."" He explained that there are two budgets, that of the Arts and Sciences and that of the College, and ""if the College wants to keep the Colloquia, it can support it out of its own budget."" He then said that if he thought the program was worth keeping, ""in principle, the money could come from Arts and Sciences."" Cohen, who during his six-year term as provost of Northwestern University nearly tripled their research budget from $59 million to $lOO million, said ""ultimately, every decision is financial."" The fundamental financial issue at hand with Colloquia is that, whereas previously, faculty who taught the Colloquia did so without reducing their teaching loads for other courses, ""now they're getting released from their other courses."" While Cohen pointed the finger at the professors for teaching fewer classes, the four professors who proposed to teach the Colloquia in the Fall of 1999 were turned away for lack of funds. Cohen, who Professor of Biology Darcy Kelley noted for his ""canny appreciation of the means to academic ends,"" pointed out that ""it's less expensive to knock Colloquia than to hire new faculty. It's a question of how does one deploy resources."" Associate Dean Kathryn Yatrakis, who is also the secretary of the Committee on Instruction (COI), said that ""the COI is continuing its discussion of the Colloquium with the Colloquium Committee."" She pointed out that the COI has been trying to negotiate between students' various interests. ""Students have been expressing two related concerns—the size of class enrollments and the number of senior professors teaching in the Core. This means that the COI and the academic departments have to make judgements about which priorities it will meet first."" Yet, without adequate funding from either Quigley or Cohen's offices, the COI doesn't have much of a decision to make. Dean Quigley did not respond to requests for interviews, nor did he comment on correspondence that was forwarded to him. Provost Cole, Vice President Cohen, and Dean Quigley ensured that Enlargement and Enhancement would not affect the quality of the College's curriculum. ""We will not permit a larger total enrollment to require changes in the College's unique curriculum, the way it is taught, or class size inthe Core,"" they pledged in a February 1996 article in the Columbia University Record. Provost Cole also affirmed that the University classifies the Colloquia as ""upper-level elective Core classes."" However, when asked how the University could cut the Colloquia after he had made the commitment above, he changed his classification, saying, ""The Colloquium is an elective, so therefore it's not really part of the required Core."" The Demise of the Colloquia During their 67-year tenure at Columbia College, the Colloquia have gone through a number of transitional phases. Professor Marcus has observed the Colloquia over the past five decades and commented that in its early years, it was ""not just a course, it was at a very high level with some of the very best faculty teaching it."" He pointed out that ""for a couple of decades in the '6os and 70s, the Colloquia was not staffed in the best way. There was a certain decline because the faculty who were either volunteering or chosen were not as enthusiastic or as committed as faculty in the past have been. This is a historical part of the problem."" Shapiro explained that some of the problems in getting professors to staff the Colloquia stem from the trend at Columbia where more and more professors teach two classes per semester rather than three. While Professors Marcus and Shapiro remember a time when four Colloquia were offered a semester, servingI w approximately 30 seniors and 30 juniors, the current Colloquia's limited resources have made it so that only one class is offered per semester, serving 15 students in total. Today's Columbia College students, who find themselves in larger classes, may lose out on a muchneeded opportunity to have that last connection with what the College's glossy pamphlets market as that which makes Columbia unique. Where Do We Go From Here? After spending three years sending out letters and trying to drum up support for their program within the Administration, the Colloquium Committee is ready to see some action. ""From my perspective, the institution has to make some kind of decision. Either see the Colloquium as important and commit to it or see other programs as more important, in which case defend that, justify that,"" Professor Shapiro said. ""I can live with any decision that's made as long as there's a decision."" If the Administration chose to support the Colloquia, Professor Shapiro suggested that it could be improved by bringing in high-level visiting professors or by making wide-ranging long appointments in faculty. Steven Marcus also noted, ""if it's going to continue, which I hope it will, there would have"
274,Enlargement and Its Discontents,20 April 1999,"Columbia's top university administrators are doubtless ethical people, but because we have limited information, it is sometimes hard for students to interpret facts like the three that follow. Next year we face a housing crisis that URH Director Ross Fraser pins on increasing numbers of students who remain in residence, not Enlargement and Enhancement — even though an early E & E projection took into account the anticipated increase in reten-tion rates. Columbia's Colloquia are to be cancelled next year. They are a key part of the principles that ledGore Vidal to call Columbia the only American university to have produced a genuinely new intellectual tradition. Alas, they are not cost effective, and thus will be cut —even though Provost Cole promised that enlargement and enhancement would not compromise the quality of our education. It is possible that there are believable, rational explanations for each of these incidents. Alas, because all the information is not made available to them, there is no way for students to judge. That is unfortunate, for it leaves them with the impression that their senior administrators are deceiving them —through omission, evasion or distortion, and only rarely outright falsehood, but deceiving nonetheless. And from that only one conclusion can be drawn: that the senior administrators have so little respect for the students as to be contemptible. Several years ago, Professor George Flynn chaired a committee that aimed to examine Columbia's student services and discover why they were so poorly received by students. Among the results were an influential document known colloquially as the Flynn Report, the creation of Mark Burstein's vice presidency, and significant changes to the ways student services were provided. To a large extent, these changes were successful. Yet student opinion of the administration as a whole remains low. Only half the task has been completed. There remains in the upper echelons a prevailing atmosphere of disrespect and disavowal of responsibility. This atmosphere may be based on the feeling that students are incapable of understanding the fiscal realities of the university, or it may be based on the need to avoid acknowledging the political camps into which the University is divided. Regardless, it is tragic. Faced with an uphill battle for information in which details are the reward for subservience, student representatives choose subservience and forgo their ability to represent. It becomes necessary to have a ""relationship"" with the administration, as an undergraduate Senator wrote in a recent letter to the Spectator. A policy of open dialogue and full disclosure is the only thing that can truly change the widespread distrust of Columbia's administration. Presented with all the relevant information—including accurate information onthe university's imminent financial crisis—students and alumni might well agree with more of their administrators' decisions. If not, at least they would know that they had their administrators' respect. I once received a phone call from a Morningside Heights resident who had heard that I was a student activist and wanted to be sure his concern was addressed. ""What I want to know is,"" he asked me, ""what are you doing about the bricks?"" At the time enlargement and enhancementwas the lost cause of the day, so I was a little taken aback. ""Bricks?"" I replied. This man and other commu-nity residents were livid that Columbia had chosen to use cheap, square, machine-cut bricks for its sidewalks instead of the smaller, shinier bricks with rounded edges. The use of machine-cut bricks was a major shift in historical tradition, he explained. They signified the defeat of tradition and beauty by the forces of market capitalism, forces thatdemanded —or seemed to demand —that Columbia prostitute herself. When I hung up the phone I laughed. Here I was trying to prevent a situation I knew would cause rampant overcrowding, corporatization and a whole host of other problems, and someone was yelling at me about the bricks. It seemed absurd—until I realized that I was treating him just as upper-level administrators treated me. Alma Mater's lap was more comfortable before she became a prostitute. Now, whenever one lays one's head on her breast, one cannot help but wonder: who else has been there? It is useless to ask —though she may teach us to search for truth, and act with honor and ethics, when we look for her example there is none that can be found. When we ask her to explain, she answers only with lies. We must be her bastard children, then, disowned and disrespected. We knock at the door, we try to prove our steadfast love, we weep. (I weep.) She cannot give us every gift, it is true, but at the core we do not ask for much. We ask only for honesty and respect.This seems to be the most popular lament at Columbia today. Increasingly, we question the commitment of the university to the education of its undergraduates. Certainly Columbia students have a 30- or 40-year tradition, if not a 245-year tradition, of questioning the status quo. But scarce have Columbia students asked themselves so seriously whether the administration gives a damn about the quality of their education. Even as Columbia announces it is reorienting its attention and resources away from its gradu-ate schools and towards its undergraduate program, Columbia College students sit on radiators in someclasses, are unable to register for other classes because of over-enrollment, and are taught by TAs or junior professors in more still. Is this why we came to Columbia? Certainly each individual Columbia student came because of and in spite of a great variety of different motivations. But the one reason we all came here was that we expected the quality of instruction to be top-notch.We expected small classes, and we expected a good number of them to be taught by full professors. Columbia's brochures told us we were getting Harvard's faculty with Swarthmore's attention to undergraduates. Now it appears we get a little of both and a lot of neither. It is understandable that many of Columbia's star professors teach huge lecture courses since demand for their classes is so great. But why don't more of them also teach Core classes, especially since Columbia bills the Core as a group of seminars taught by senior faculty? Indeed, that dying breed — senior professors—constitutes only 23 percent of those teaching Literature Humanities this academic year, down from 26 percent in 1997-8. The remainder is taught by junior faculty and graduate students, some of whom work in departments only tangentially related to Lit Hum, like sociology. The administration's expressed rationale for employing dozens of graduate students to teach the Core is that students benefit from a more modern perspective on the texts. But if Columbia were genuinely interested in making all of its students examine more modern perspectives, it would incorporate more modern texts into the curriculum itself, rather than rely on younger teachers to explain classical texts. The fact is that integrating more modern perspectives into the Core is not at the heart of the administration's decision to substitute graduate students for professors in Core classes. Money is. And money is also at the root of the administration's hushed effort to kill off the Colloquia, as reported by the Spectator last Wednesday [Colloquia May no Longer Be Offered, Apr. 14]. Despite the administration's lip service to improving undergraduate education, Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen characterized the intimate experience of two professors teaching 15 students as ""an inefficient deployment of | resources."""
275,"the cause Feature of seven activists, on the legacy and future of the movement",21 April 1999,"Feature of seven activists, on the legacy and future of the movementBy TIZOC BRENES AND YOJAIRY SANCHEZ Spectator Staff WritersIt was this time of the year. In April 1996, students frustrated with an inadequate African American Studies program, the lack of Latino Studies program and Asian American Studies program, organized a hunger strike and takeover of Low Library and Hamilton Hall. After five days of fasting, Heather Starr, BC '96, was carried to the hospital. Ten days later, and after 22 arrests, the activists and the administration agreed to a compromise. The last three years of the ethnic studies movement have consisted of negotiations between students and administrators to achieve the promises made by the 1996 agreement. Hiring senior and junior faculty in Latino and Asian American studies, and an overall strengthening of the three programs, has been the subject of student debate with faculty. Today, African American Studies is a thriving program, but Latino and Asian American Studies are still struggling to be established. Native American studies remains only a rare topic of conversation between advocates. All three existing programs are run from the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race. Advocates of ethnic studies are still fighting to find the subject's place in Columbia's curriculum. Ethnic studies has once again garnered recognition around the Columbia campus because of the activities of the organization Students Promoting Empowerment and Knowledge (SPEaK). The group organized a three-day Higher Education Conference earlier in April at the pinnacle of their activities this year. The conference, organized entirely by students, was the first conference that directly addressed the state of ethnic studies programs at Columbia, and encouraged a dialogue between students, teachers, and administrators. The activities of SPEaK demonstrate the position of the advocates —there is still much progress to be made. Seven current and former ethnic studies activists share their thoughts on and experiences with ethnic studies. Garcia One of the more visible figures in the movement this year has been Antonio Garcia, CC '99, co-chair of SPEaK Garcia joined the movement four years ago, in October 1995, out of a desire to be involved in the campus community. ""The community of color knew who was involved in the movement —they were articulate, visible, and passionate,"" Garcia said. ""I wanted to be like them, so I hung around them, and before I knew it, they approached me."" His time in the struggle, says Garcia, has shaped him as a student and equipped him with the skills that he needed to make an impact on society. ""The movement has changed my life in a powerful way,"" Garcia said. ""It has been my initiation into social justice, reformand activism, and more than anything it has developed me into a critical thinker and caretaker of my community."" Garcia said he believes those who criticize the movement should ask themselves critical questions regarding the apparent lack of racial equality within American society. ""They need to take a look around and ask themselves why Americans of color are disproportionately the most impoverished, poorly educated, and most disempowered sector of this country and many regions of the world over, and analyze why there are more black and Latino men in prisons than institutions of higher learning,"" Garcia said. ""If you don't believe that this is natural and that these people aren't inherently stupid or lazy, then drop your security blanket and dare to think about race, injustice, and inequality."" According to Garcia, many of his own personal experiences as a minority have motivated his participation in the ethnic studies movement. ""In my Contemporary Civilization class my sophomore year, I remember literally being taught that Native Americans were savages, and I don't remember any teacher addressing the critical implications of racism, sexism, and classism which affected our daily lives,"" Garcia said. ""I saw that the thinkers, writers, artist, musicians, generals, heroes were never Chicano, Filipino, or black and I realized that this was never intended for me.""Kaufman Elizabeth Kaufman, BC '99 and a co-chair of SPEaK, has been involved in the ethnic studies movement since her first year at Columbia. Her political activism, however, extends itself to her years in high school. The transition from activism in high school to college required her to temporarily step back and get acquainted with organizing at the college level, which the student leaders of the time showed her. ""The movement that was going on at Columbia was the embodiment of what I had been fighting for at my high school,"" Kaufman said. ""However, [Columbia's struggle] was on a scale that was hard for me to imagine, since the racial balance was so different and the level of organization was so high,"" she said, but she ""immediately related to it because I shared the same progressive standards, but I had to figure out what role I was going to play in it."" Kaufman said her commitment to the movement was strengthened by the attitude of people in academia toward people of color. ""My freshman year, [a Columbia researcher] conducted a 'study' of primarily African-American and Latino children where she tried to 'prove' that they were more prone to violence. She gave them some kind of substance that made them hyperactive and then tried to say her theory was right,"" she said. Kaufman's involvement with ethnic studies was gradual. ""I became involved as a first-year, but I wasn't in the core organizing group. I went to most rallies, general meetings, marches, etc., but didn't go to smaller meetings until my sophomore year,"" she said. Columbia's climate in 1995, the year Kaufman entered the College, was one awaiting explosion of social protest. ""My class, '99, entered at a very tense time politically. All of the organizing from the '6os to the '9os, led up to the conditions of '95 and '96, and the student base was extremely strong and reliable. The upper classes all had really strong leadership, and my class provided a lot of mass support and was basically down for anything,"" Kaufman recalled. ""We came in kind of in the middle of everything, to really fast paced conditions, and there was no time for an orientation —we learned through direct actions and observations."" Shiroma lan Shiroma, CC '99, is a Sociology major who graduated in December and currently works for the Coalition Against AntiAsian Violence. Like Kaufman, he arrived at Columbia just before the hunger strike and takeover of Hamilton.""l've been involved in this ethnic studies movement since around February of '96. I was familiar with the wealth of courses available at CUNY schools at the time and it was painfully clear that [Columbia's] offerings in ethnic studies were woefully inept. While that much was clear, I didn't understand my own power to do anything about it."" Shiroma was inspired by the leaders of that time. ""A multiracial coalition of fearless, dedicated, and articulate students became visible in their attempts to bring ethnic studies to Columbia. Sharod X, [then President of the Black Students Organization], was a part of that coalition who had gained national notoriety earlier in the year for some statements he made in his Spectator column. In February, he wrote something like, 'Students of all races and religions must come together to fight for justice',"" Shiroma said. Shiroma said he responded to the column by calling for more activism. ""I wrote to the Spec challenging all Columbia students to heed the call. For me personally, it was natural to support the movement because it reflected the discipline's explicit commitment to racial justice."" His reasons for being active in the ethnic studies movement were political and personal. ""I feel that the University has a responsibility to be a place where solutions to community problems are addressed and where students really struggle to find solutions. Ethnic studies is a field that attacks some of the more pressing problems of the community, institutional racism, poverty, and how those problems affect peoples everyday lives."" He added, 'To me, ideally, ethnic studies focuses on those problems in the community and creates new possibilities for solutions. On Columbia's campus there was so much racial tension—much more than I was accustomed to. Columbia was shocking. I have a younger sister, five years old. I felt a responsibility to be involved in the movement which fought for constructive solutions."" Shiroma recounted a critical experience in Contemporary Civilizations (CC) that deepened his understanding for greater representation of people of color in Columbia's curriculum. ""For me, one critical event was when we celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday in 1996 and we dedicated a whole class in CC. By far that was the most meaningful class of my career at Columbia."" Shiroma's realization helped him think about the entire curriculum, not just CC. ""It really highlighted the need for more of those forums, that the struggle for freedom and justice in this country didn't endpassing of a few laws in the '6os. Around that time, ethnic studies activist students \X were fighting against the racial- \^ N ly exclusionary curriculum at \ Columbia. It showed me how desper- \ ately students at Columbia needed a more meaningful curriculum which strove to further the struggle for justice in this country."" Ochoa One of the major figures within the Ethnic Studies movement of 1996 was Joaquin Ochoa, a graduate of Teacher's College and one of the 15 hunger strikers in the Spring 1996 protests. Unlike many of the student activists, Ochoa's participation in the movement began long before his time at Columbia. He says that his involvement started when he undertook a hunger strike for the establishment of a Chicano Studies department during his undergraduate years at the University of California at Los Angeles. Ochoa believes that, although progress might be slow, many people are beginning to recognize the importance of ethnic studies within higher education. ""I think that a lot of liberal whites have seen the benefits to the issues at hand and they don't live in a little bubble as much, so they see that learning about all people is important,"" Ochoa said. ""Before, I didn't see it happening, but now I know you need gay, white, black and all other communities to work together to build a strong bridge."" Columbia, says Ochoa, is at a good position for the development of an ethnic studies department, in that it would set the pace for other universities that are looking to develop a more culturally encompassing curriculum. ""The administration should take note that the room to forge a study for others to follow isn't always presented, so in my opinion this is a very opportune time for Columbia to be an innovator,"" Ochoa said. Jealous Ben Jealous was part of Columbia College's class of 1994, but graduated in 1997. He currently works in the Chaplain's office in Earl Hall. His long association with Columbia was interrupted his freshman year when he was suspended for his involvement in the Audubon Ballroom takeover during the fall semester of 1994. When he came back to Columbia, the ethnic studies move-ment was active, and \ despite his sus- \ pension, he joined \ the activists. \ Jealous says the reasons \ were ""basically friendship and solidarity with a number of leaders whom I had gone with to the Audobon, and a general frustration of lack of professors of color and the mistreatment of the ones that were here."" He acted as an advisor by sharing his expertise in political organizing. Jealous remembered studying the Core Curriculum and - finding that the experiences of his people were ignored or marginalized. ""The first day of Art Humanities, I was told that 'For the purposes of this class, we will consider Egypt to be in Europe.' For me, that geography was as tragic and misguided as it was creative and bold,"" Jealous said, ""In Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, they always throw people of color at the end. We were either negated or tacked on at the very end in a very nonchalant way."" Ethnic studies was an investment in the future, said Jealous. ""As a student of color at Columbia, I felt it was a responsibility to make sure that this university continued to be improved in ways [that many might not see]."" He continued, ""As someone who expected to be an alumnus of the University, I wanted to make sure this University was a place where I would want to send my kids to, that their culture would be valued, studied, and celebrated by this University.""Richardson Evans Richardson, CC 'O2, became involved in the Ethnic Studies movement shortly after his arrival at Columbia. He attributes this early activism to his disillusionment with school's curriculum. ""I came to this school expecting an education that would, as the College brochure claims, provideme with an 'international perspective and a cutting edge curriculum,""' Richardson said. ""I was deeply disappointed when I recognized the blatant Eurocentrism behind Columbia's curriculum."" By not providing students with an adequate curriculum, says Richardson, the school is not preparing students to face the realities of contemporary society. ""Every university should provide its students with a curriculum that will prepare them for life in an increasingly complex global environment, but the problem is that Columbia has yet to reconcile its academic rhetoric with its educational reality,"" Richardson said. ""If our goal is to cultivate the world's future leaders, let's free ourselves from the shackles of Western tradition, and create a new curriculum that will accomplish this task more effectively."" Richardson said he believes the movement is reflective of the need minorities have to receive an education that informs them of their own background and culture. ""This movement seeks to put the study of people of color within a position of academic legitimacy on Columbia's campus,"" said Richardson. According to Richardson, the changes that the Ethnic Studies movement proposes have wider possibilities for establishing change in the outside community addressing societal problems. ""Ethnic studies attempts to help everyone reach a greater understanding of race and ethnicity, how our notions of race have developed through the years and how we can identify and deconstruct the institutions that have perpetuated racism and the oppression of people of color for so long,"" Richardson said. ""Basically, the goal of all ethnic studies advocates is the liberation of people of color."" Baylor Amber Baylor, CC 'O2, just recently joined the ethnic studies movement when a friend invited her to one of the meetings for SPEaK. Baylor said she feels her activism has allowed her to more deeply understand her position as a student within the University and the responsibilities that come with it. ""Before I became involved I was enshrouded in a sort of apathy, but this organization has definitely encouraged me to play an active role in my education,"" Baylor said. ""I feel like imparting true knowledge means taking into account and trying to understand the various perspectives our society is comprised of, not simply observing these communities peripherally through a narrow, traditional viewpoint,"" she said. Baylor believes that her exposure to incidents like the death of Amadou Diallo, helped her to see the potential impact of ethnic studies in the community. ""If one thing was imparted to first-years of color, it was the danger of and chaos incurred by those in power when they are separated and completely out of touch with many of the ethnic communities they deal with daily,"" Baylor said. ""It is imperative that we work towards becoming more aware of the perspectives and histories of the people who surround us."" ""Many people are unaware, however, of the tremendous behind-the-scenes work [such as] planning sessions, meetings with administrators, networking, that goes on before students are forced into public protest,"" Baylor said.

276,Students and Enlargement: Enhancement Not in Sight,22 April 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN and BENJAMIN LOWE Spectator Associate News Editor and News EditorA large, costly, and ambitious program undertaken by the Administration to enlarge the University is notuncommon in the school's 200-year history. But Enlargement and Enhancement, initiated by and announced at a University Senate Meeting by University Provost Jonathan Cole in Jan. 1996, is the most ambitious and most costly program—both in terms of money and perhaps the quality of an undergraduate's education —to enhance the University since its move to the Morningside Heights area over 100 years ago. The effects of Enlargement and Enhancement on the infrastructure are clear to students on campus. The $84.8 million Alfred Lerner student center, the $53.9 million new Broadway Dorm, the $70.4 million renovation of Butler Library, the $31.4 million worth of recent renovations to Furnald and Mcßain, and future renovations to River, Carman, and Wien, comprise most of the $288.5 million dedicated to infrastructure enhancement in the next six years, according to a table released by the office of University President George Rupp. But for many students and professors at Columbia today, the glistening new marble on the corner of114 th St. and Broadway is a facade, shifting people's attention away from the University's problems in keeping up with academics. Students and professors have complained of the following: University-wide class overcrowding; the University's apparent inability to hire enough faculty to keep up with the rising undergraduate population; the lack of senior faculty teaching the Core; the low number of alumni doners; and Columbia College's no longer being the smallest school in the Ivy League. The most consequential change of Enlargement and Enhancement for today's University undergraduates may not be the infrastructure renovations, but the University's apparent inability to hire new professors and improve academic conditions because of the debt service on the bonds it is using to finance the infrastructure. According to Cole and Vice President of Arts and Sciences (A&S) David Cohen, A&S, which is responsible for hiring professors, has paid for the majority of the bonds that have been used to pay for Lerner Hall. Although Cohen admitted that ""a dollar is a dollar,"" and the money that A&S needs to spend on Lerner is reducing the amount of money available to hire professors, both Cohen and Cole asserted that the decrease has not diminished the University's ability to hire professors. ""We have been in pretty reasonable shape in respects to our faculty salary budget,"" Cohen said. ""I don't feel overall that we are understaffed."" However, Chair of the Classics Department Richard Bagnall said that A&S does lack funds to hire professors because the extra spending on the infrastructure was predicated by the University's plan to raise tuition each year by six percent. ""Debt service is rising faster than tuition,"" he said. Bagnall said that there was a 5.4 percent increase in the tuition and a smaller increase in the rooming costs, leading to an overall increase of only 4.9 percent last year. Administrators did not verify these numbers. Administrators did not verify that tuition had to be raised six percent in order to give A&S the same amount of money available to hire professors as it had before E&E, but Cole said that the University has ""needed to lower the increase"" in tuition because it is uncompetitive with its rival universities, the rest of the Ivy League, Stanford and the University of Chicago. University Senate minutes from the Feb. 23, 1996 meeting indicate that several committees had serious concerns about the effects on embarking on a program like Enlargement and Enhancement. One of the committees, the Budgetary Committee, which was then chaired by Classics Professor James Zeztel, indicated it was concerned how the University could fund such a program. The Budget Review Committee ""endorsed the overall plan for enlargement but had doubts about some of the projections of costs and revenues found in the report,"" the committee reported. ""As to costs, the committee thought that added instructional costs would exceed the estimates in the report; as to revenues, [the committee] doubted the realism of an indefinite future with two-percent-above-inflation tuition increases without dramatic improvement in the level of student satisfaction,"" according to the minutes. Enlargement and Enhancement was created to alleviate the University's shortage of money and to increase its approximately $4 billion endowment, one of the smallest in the Ivy League. But the ultimate goal of the program—not to have a shortage of money—is not expected to be reached until well after the turn of the century. Until then, the University, which isnormally squeezed for money, will be squeezed even more so. Enlargement and Enhancement's other contribution to the University is the increase in the undergraduate population. In the academic year of 1997-98, there were 4,830 students in the College and SEAS. Three academic years later, 1999-2000, there will be a projected 5,500 undergraduates, a five percent increase. The College alone has increased its population by 14 percent in the last six years. Administrators say that combined with the gradual decrease in the number of graduate students enrolled in the University, it is a move designed to make the College the focal point of the University. The Plan The idea behind Enlargement and Enhancement is that it will increase the number and percentage of students who will donate money to Columbia after they graduate. The University's alumni giving rate of 30 percent, meaning that 30 percent of all alumni gave money to Columbia, ranked 32nd among national universities, according to U.S. News and World Report. The percentage and ranking is the lowest of all national universities in the country's top 10. The inclusion of the alumni giving rate, which comprises five percent of Columbia's general ranking among all universities, kept Columbia from ranking higher, although administrators deny that the rankings affect any decision-making. Columbia is currently ranked 10th overall in the country. By increasing the number of students to graduate, the University is assuring itself of more alumni donations, even if the percentage of alumni giving does not rise. Enlargement and Enhancement attempts to provide students with a more rewarding academic and personal experience at the University, which can be seen with the completion of Lerner Hall and the new senior dorm. Enhancing students' experiences is yet another way the University can increase its low alumni giving rate —the more fondly an alum looks back on his or her time as an undergraduate, the more likely he or she is to donate to the University. Enlargement and Enhancement makes the College the focalpoint of the University, and College graduates have traditionally been the most loyal alumni. While this is true, the increase in the undergraduate population causes potential problems for students attending the University today. As outlined in a bulletin released from Rupp's office, there were five conditions on which the University increased the undergraduate population: maintaining the academic quality of undergraduates; keeping needblind admission and full-need financial aid policies; guaranteeing four years of housing; maintaining the commitment to the Core and small classes; and continung to enroll a diverse student body. The University said it has avoided any decrease in student quality, proven by the College's 14.3 percent acceptance rate last year—the third most selective in the country—as well as the University's ability to bring in ""top-quality"" professors, Cole said. While some claim that Enlargement and Enhancement has already attracted more students to apply, some say that the popularity of the University is directly due to the popularity of New York City. Cole said that the popularity is due to a mix between the City and the enhancements the University made. ""We've gcw|s» the word out about Columbia,"" Cole said. ""There have been very visible investments in undergraduate education —the College is being brought to the forefront —and New York City is thriving and popular.""Bagnall, however, insists that it is New York City alone that has sparked Columbia's popularity. Need-blind admission and full-need financial aid policies have been maintained, Cole said, as has the guarantee that undergraduates receive University housing all four years. Yet the latter guarantee is clouded by the housing shortage that has left upperclass students living in housing normally used by sophomores, and has left more rising sophomores than last year on the waiting list for the fall semester, as of Wednesday. Last year, about 4,950 College and SEAS undergradutes lived in University housing, whereas next year, there will be about 5,050 undergraduates. Assistant Director of University Residence Halls Rob Lutomski said that this rise has not been met with a rise in housing. Director of URH Ross Frazier, however, asserted that this year's housing concerns will not be present next year. ""Broadway Residence Hall will take care of any capacity problems we have [this year],"" he said. ""We've looked ahead to 2000-2001 and beyond, and we've accounted for those plans for the future."" Administrators have consistently attributed this housing shortage to a rise in retention rates, rather than an increase in the undergraduate population. Students' largest concern stemming from Enlargement and Enhancement is the average size of classes and the University's ability to allow its students in Core classes to be taught by senior professors.Class overcrowding is especially apparent in the Economics, Political Science, Psychology, and Math Departments. In general, students complain mostly about the size of introductory- and intermediate-level courses. University statistics indicate that since 1994, classes with 50 to 99 students have increased by half —classes that in the past were smaller than 50 students. According to statistics released by Director of the Core Eileen Gillooly, the average number of students in each section of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization has remained under 22. Yet according to the same statistics, less than 25 percent of this academic year's Literature Humanities and less than 20 percent of this year's Contemporary Civilization sections were taught by a senior faculty member. Statistics released by the registrar indicate that the University offered 433 classes in 1000 to 3000 level courses in Biological sciences, economics, English and comparative literature, composition, history, political science, and psychology, for the academic year '94-'95. These same departments only offered 414 classes this academic year, despite the five percent increase in the total number of undergraduates. Although Cohen did not attribute this decrease in classes offered to any factor, he said earlier this year that the increase in the number of credits undergraduates have taken in the last four years has been met with no increase in the number of professors.News AnalysisE&E has brought physical improvements to the campus, but many question if these improvements will include academic enhancement."
277,"Class Dean Resigns, Returns to Teaching",23 April 1999,"By BRIAN HO RAN Spectator Associate News EditorAs the first year of the class center advising system comes to a close, Junior Class Dean John Axcelson will become the second class dean to leave his position in the past month, terminating his current employment in June to return to teaching. Axcelson, who came to Columbia in 1981 as a Ph.D. candidate and Literature Humanities teacher, will become an adjunct assistant professor in Columbia's English Department, and will teach two courses each semester beginning in the fall. ""I'm going to have some time to do some writing and scholarship,"" Axcelson said in reference to his part-time teaching position. ""I was originally trained as a scholar. It seemed to me it was time to get back into that."" Associate Dean for CC/SEAS Student Affairs Sandra Johnson, who coordinates the class center project, said the University willbegin its search for replacements, both for Axcelson and Sophomore Class Dean Susan Foight, who left her position in mid-March, and will have new deans in place by July. ""John has made a decision to change his career path, and that happens to all of us,"" Johnson said, adding, ""I respect him for that, and wish him the best of luck in that endeavor.""Of his experience as a house and class dean, Axcelson said, ""I thought it was a great experience. I do regret leaving it because I enjoyed working with undergrads."" According to Johnson, Axcelson has been an asset to the dean's office. ""He has certainly contributed to the Dean of Student Affairs staff over the years."" Axcelson said he made the decision to leave in February after the Administration decided that with the advent of the new advising system, class deans should not teach. He had said he would wait until the end of the fiscal year in June to step down. ""It was decided that they didn't want people who do the thing that I do to also be teaching,"" Axcelson said. ""That decision coincided with my desire to do more teaching and more scholarship."" As a house dean for four years immediately prior to becoming aclass dean, Axcelson simultaneously taught in the English department. According to Johnson, teaching would interfere with the full-time responsibilities of being a class dean, ""The focus of the position and the responsibilities of it are full time,"" she said. ""Everybody puts in so much time as it is; to ask [Axcelson] to teach also would be asking him to do three jobs."" Although she said she was not able to speak for deans outside of student affairs, Johnson said that, while other deans on campus do in fact teach, the official responsibilities of some of those positions do include teaching. Axcelson said the existing advising system that uses the class center structure is generally a good idea, but he also said that the existing system needs to develop before its advantages can be fully realized. ""I think it's a work in progress like a lot of things around here,"" he said, adding, ""Structurally it makes a lot of sense. Good things will come of it,"" Axcelson said. Johnson and Axcelson both said that the old system, which assigned each student to a personal advisor from the outset, was unpopular and undesirable. ""There were a lot of problems with [the old system] as well [as the new one],"" Axcelson said. According to Johnson, 'The advising system was changed last year in response to student feedback. It wasn't working."" Johnson said the new system is significantly more popular, because of advantages such as the existence of a physical class center, deans who are trained with a class focus, and what she called the ""holistic approach"" of the system. ""Our preliminary response is very positive,"" she said. ""There is an enormous amount gained from having the class centers,"" Axcelson said. ""It does offerboth an enormous opportunity to walk in and to create an individual advising relationship with one of the deans."" However, Axcelson also acknowledged inherent problems with the system. ""You lose something when you have a class center rather than an individual advisor,"" he said, stressing the fact that a system using individual advisors only works if those advisors are interested in working with students, and if the relationship between advisor and student ""clicks."" Axcelson also proposed a slighly different advising system, although he said it is currently a logistical impossibility. He said he would retain the first-year class centers, with constant first-year deans trained specifically to deal with those student problems associated primarily with first year experiences, including assimilation into the college community. However, Axcelson said he would have the other class deans remain with the classes, so that relationships between deans and students could be preserved throughout the students' time at Columbia. But he also said that in the current system, in which each class center is located in a residence hall with a high percentage of students from that particular class, deans would then be in the position of having to move each year, which makes the idea untenable. Johnson said Axcelson's proposal was not under examination by the Administration. ""That is not something that's considered,"" she said. ""One of the benefits of the class centers structure is that people are very in-tune to the needs of the class,"" she said. That is, deans aretrained to be familiar with certain issues relating to the class a student is in. ""What we create then is staff that ... can utilize that expertise in working with students,"" she said.""There aren't any major changes [being planned] because things are working well,"" Johnson said, adding that the Administration constantly assesses this advising system and other systems on campus, thinking ""how that structure needs to be modified to meet the varying needs of students."" Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen said Columbia is constantly dealing with the issue of maintaining structure in advising without being ""overly prescriptive."" ""You always have to walk sort of a fine line,"" according to Cohen. When asked whether it is problematic that students have to take the initiative when seeking advising, Cohen said, ""The students at Columbia don't need to be led by the hand."" He cited one of the principal advantages of the current advising system as being the ""ready-access"" of advisors at the class centers. Cohen did say that in comparison with that of other schools, ""Ours [advising system] seems to be more problematic than most.""Dean John Axcelson"
278,Former English Prof Censures Dept.,6 October 1999,"By CHARLES LANDOW Spectator Junior Staff WriterEdward W. Tayler, the Lionel Trilling professor in the Humanities and former chair of the Committee on Composition, resigned from his post in June. Calling the English Department, of which he had been a member since 1960, ""second-rate"" and ""ungovernable,"" Tayler cited his disgust at the personal infighting that was taking place between his colleagues as the reason for his retirement. Although Tayler was a noted scholar in Shakespeare and Milton, he was best known for his work in developing Logic and Rhetoric (L & R), the principal writing course in Columbia College's Core Curriculum. He created and designed the class, required for allfirst-year College students, in the early 1980s, when he also became chair of the Committee on Composition. But over the last decade, Tayler said, he grew dissatisfied with the fighting that was going on between L & R instructors. Teachers focused more on political conflicts than the actual instruction of the course. ""People go to meetings and scream at each other instead of asking what we can do for the students,"" Tayler said. Tayler said there was also a general lack of support for L & R among the faculty. Although the Committee on Composition— which made academic decisions regarding L & R—disbanded about 10 years ago, and Tayler had resigned from the com-mittee in protest, he kept teaching his courses until last year. His dissatisfaction with the English Department continued, though. Finally, Tayler said, ""I was going to have an ulcer or a heart attack, and I decided it just wasn't worth it."" Despite the squabbles in his department, Tayler remained widely praised as a teacher firmly dedicated to and focused on his students. Sandra Pierson Prior, the current director of Composition, said of his retirement, ""I think it's a terrible loss for his students and colleagues."" David Denby, a writer for The New Yorker who made Tayler a main character in Great Books, hisrecent book about Columbia's Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses, said, ""He's one of the great teachers of all time."" Denby praised Tayler's ability to have students draw connections between seemingly disparate topics, making them ""feel like they are reading literature for the first time."" Brander Matthews Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Martin Meisel, the current chair of the English Department and a former vice president of the School of Arts and Sciences, said, ""There are always a few people who are recognized both internally and externally as great teachers, and there is no question that Ted Tayler was a great teacher."" However, although Meisel does not flatly deny personnel problems in his department, he does not agree that personal infighting has decreased the quality of instruction in L & R and other courses, as Tayler suggested. ""Debates that have occurred in the discipline of literary studies have not hindered teaching,"" Meisel said. Prior said that students are unaffected by fighting among instructors. In reference to Tayler's description of personal conflicts, Prior said, ""I wouldn't say I don't think that [there is no fighting in the department], I just don't think it affects L & R."" Prior did, however, stress that she is not a full voting member of the English Department, so although she is heavily involved inthe instruction of L & R, she is an ""outsider"" among English Department personnel. Over the years Tayler taught Literature Humanities and courses on 16th and 17th century English poetry as well as L & R. Personnel problems were evident in L & R from the beginning, Tayler said. In the course's first year, each instructor created his or her own standards, which, Tayler said, led to ""chaos"" for the students. Two years later, Tayler single-hand-edly created uniform requirements, demystifying the course's expectations for students. After instituting those guidelines, Tayler said, teaching assistants in L & R signed a petition calling for Tayler to be ousted, but the dispute blew over.Following the dispute, the English Department no longer oversaw decisions related to L&R. Prior explained that the Committee on the Core Curriculum and its Subcommittee on Writing now make the important changes to L & R. Also, instructors from different departments now teach sections of the course. Although, according to Meisel, the English Department has not been ""free of bad manners Tayler conceded that he was never treated badly by anyone at anytime."" Meisel expressed optimism for the future of the English Department. Since he took over as chair in July, Meisel said, 'The mood and temper of the department have been very cooperative, very forward-looking."" He said the department is now seeking to hire two new members, although ""the size of the faculty is constrained by the Arts and Sciences administration.""Prof. Edward W. Tayler"
279,Conference Spotlights American Studies,11 October 1999,"By DAVID GERRARD and FELICE BAJORAS Spectator Contributing WritersIn keeping with the interdisciplinary nature of American Studies, academics attending the 60th Anniversary of American Studies Conference at Barnard this weekend discussed subjects ranging from the legitimacy of American Studies itself, to the validity of reading the Iliad, to last April's massacre in Littleton, Colorado. One of the first colleges in the country to instate an American Studies Program, Barnard has been a pioneer in this field since 1939. The conference brought together many Barnard alumnae and American Studies experts, includ-ing Linda Kerber, BC '6O, professor of history at the University of lowa, who was critical of the earlier years of Barnard's program in her keynote address Friday, accusing the professors of ""educational malpractice."" Kerber said the professors she had when she attended Barnard presented a whitewashed view of American society, which required ""skimming over anti-Semitic passages"" in texts and neglecting to mention the more gruesome facts of history. In her remarks Saturday, the program's principle founder Elspeth Davies-Rostow, BC '39, disagreed with Kerber's characterization of the program, saying that theprogram's attitude toward such then-fashionable figures as Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, was ""highly critical."" Davies-Rostow also discussed the political climate under which American Studies was founded, one in which she said many Columbia students had fascist sympathies. She described speaking at a peace rally during which members of a Columbia fraternity lowered a swastika behind her. Davies-Rostow recalled the words of a fellow Barnard student, who said to her, '""You have no idea how nice it was to travel down theRhine and not see a single Jewish face.'"" Under these conditions, and also in the midst of the New Deal in the 19305, Davies-Rostow said, presenting a positive vision of America was essential. Kerber amended her comments at Saturday's closing session, saying that her professors ""didn't want to undermine us,"" and in fact helped her develop useful critical skills, conceding that she should not have made the comments she did on Friday. Kerber did have much praise for the interdisciplinary nature of American Studies. ""In order to study American Studies,"" Kerber said, ""insiders must become outsiders. People are given the opportunity to criticize and examine such topics as jazz, Elvis, and the social history of electricity."" Current Barnard American Studies majors cited the program's interdisciplinary focus as its main draw. Jackie Geary, BC 'OO, who is working on a thesis on American feminism, said, ""American Studies really bridges the disciplines."" Director of American Studies Kathryn Johnson, the event's organizer, agreed. ""In trying to understand the interdisciplinary culture,"" she said, ""one must understand that nothing is off limits."" Nothing was off limits in the diverse subjects discussed during Saturday's panels. In the session on ""Feminist Politics, Feminist Culture: Past, Present, Future,"" hosted by professors Elizabeth Clement of the University of Utah, Lisa Duggan of New York University, Nowile Rooks of Princeton University, and Rosalind Rosenberg of Barnard, conference attendees discussed the varied role of femininity throughout American history. Rosenberg discussed the fact that American Studies was the firstdepartment to begin hiring women at Brandeis. Clement discussed the role of ""overly patriotic"" women in World War 11, meaning those women who had sex with soldiers as a means of displaying their patriotism. Duggan discussed the fact that the diffusion of femininity-the belief that ""power shouldn't limit the American woman"" into the academic world has turned a subject that was once a political debate into everyday life. When examining femininity, Clement said, 'We must, as scholars and feminists, examine the quality of the day. We stand on their shoulders and see the world through the changes that they wrought."" 'Whither Perry Miller? Is There a Canon in American Studies,"" a panel comprised of Andrew Delßanco of Columbia University, Lisa Gordis of Barnard, Teresa Anne Murphy of George Washington University, Cyrus R.K. Patel of New York University, and Howard Wach of CUNY-Lehman College, discussed the idea of a required reading list in American Studies programs across the country. Wach, who said he often deals with students who are not receptive to much of the traditional American Studies literature, said that by giving students diaries, letters, and oral histories of ordinary Americans, they identify with the subjects and tend to learn more. Delßanco spoke of the importance of literature in relation to history. ""Literature such as that of Perry Miller and others,"" he said, ""helps us to rediscover the American past and helps us to bring it back to life."" Delßanco said that that we should have a canon in American Studies filled with all of the great storytellers of history to create a useable past. This canon was also a major focus of the panel ""Blaming Culture: The Power of PopularCulture in American Society."" Panelist Riv-Ellen Prell, professor of American Studies at the University of Minnesota, lamented her students' reluctance to read Moby Dick. ""We used to have the problem of getting students to read Moby Dick skeptically. Now we have the problem of getting them to read it at all."" Elizabeth Napleton, BC 'OO, an American Studies major and moderator of the panel, questioned the ""relevance"" of such texts. Lecture attendee Thea Stall, BC 'OO, questioned the idea of canonical texts providing a common subject for discussion. Literature Humanities students ""might talk about the Iliad"" she said, ""but it's more like, 'Oh my God, I have 200 pages to read,' rather than when you're watching Dawson's Creek, and you're like, 'Oh my God, this guy I met at a bar last night looks just like Jack.'"" Eileen McNamara, a noted Boston Globe reporter and a member of this panel, criticized the public for being so quick to demonize the media. ""It's easy to blame the media, just as it's easy to blame black trench coats,"" she said, referring to the attention paid to the clothing worn by members of the Trenchcoat Mafia' involved in the Littleton High School massacre earlier this year. McNamara said that though the public reacted negatively to the media's presence at the funerals of Littleton victims, ""The parents wanted us there."" ""Our presence validated their children's existence,"" she said. At Saturday's closing session, Casey Nelson Blake, professor of history at Columbia and director of its brand-new American Studies program, mocked Columbia for only now adopting such a program. ""Columbia wanted to see how this would pan out. I guess after 60 years they're willing to cautiously get on the bandwagon,"" Blake said."
280,Hamilton to House New Core Office,14 October 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN Spectator Associate News EditorAs part of the planned renovation of Hamilton Hall's classrooms and entrance area, which is scheduled to begin within the next year, the University is constructing a new Core office that will serve as an administrative center and home of the new Director of the Core, College representatives said. The Core office, which will be located where the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is currently housed in 212 Hamilton, will become a physical center for the Core Curriculum where students,preceptors, and professors will be able to gather for social and intellectual purposes. The office will handle administrative actions, such as section changes for all Core classes, including Contemporary Civilization as well as Literature, Music, and Art Humanities. It will also house the Science and Major Cultures administrators to the Core, according to Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis. The new office will also serve as the administrative base for African Civilization classes, Yatrakis said, because there is currently nodepartment under which these Major-Cultures classes fall. Yatrakis said that the director of the Core position is a further development of the administrator of the Core position, which is currently filled by Eileen Gillooly. As administrator of the Core, Gillooly manages students' requests to change their Core sections, develops the class lists for Music and Art Humanities, and attempts to integrate the different aspects of the Core. Gillooly said that the new position does not add any duties to the current one. She will move into the position of director when the renovations are completed. The creation of the office is meant to unify all aspects of the Core, since many students consider the Humanities courses as separate from the Science and Major Cultures classes, Yatrakis said. ""We are seeing the office as a center for the teaching of, and the learning of the Core,"" she said. Yatrakis added that the committees on Science and Major Cultures will meet in the new office, and that all administrative actions associated with them, along with the humanities courses, will be centralized and overseen by the director. The office will be essential in the continuing integration of Major Cultures classes into the Core, Gillooly said. The office will ""facilitate interac-tion between various parts of the Core to Major Cultures to give it more support, and to greater integrate it into the Core,"" she said. Gillooly also said that the office would provide greater interdepartmental communication and encourage direct relationships between Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, and Art and Music Humanities. ""There is an idea that Lit Hum does in fact lead into CC, and that those two courses are highly connected with Music and Art,"" Gilooly said. Gillooly envisions an office where a student, inspired by his or her Literature Humanities class, will be able to research the connection of a particular book with a piece of music or a work of art that was produced in the same period, she said. Yatrakis said the office comes as part of recent growing support for the Core. She said a greater number of professors and graduate students express interest in teaching Core classes than ever before, and that there is a greater commitment to the pedagogy of those graduate students. The entire renovation of Hamilton will be ""a celebration of the Core,"" Yatrakis said. ""The office will give the Core a sense of place."" With the new office, a full-time administrative assistant will be hired to assist the Director position —it is the first such assistant to be hired in the College's history, Gillooly said. Yatrakis added that in the past, a single graduate student was responsible for all administrative aspects of the Core. Gillooly said that the decision to build a new office is one of manyrecent administrative changes to the Core. She said this was the first fall semester in which first-years were able to change their Literature Humanities sections via telephone. This policy was implemented in the spring and was made permanent this semester, she said. Gillooly also said that her office moved the deadline for changing sections via phone from October 17, which was the final date to add a non-Core class, to October 13. Gillooly noted that the move was ""a compromise between a desire to have a shopping period and credit the importance of not getting behind in Core classes."" In addition to the Director's office, there will be a seminar room, used for weekly meetings between graduate teachers of the Core and professors, as well as for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization staff meetings, Gilooly said. She wants the seminar room to have the ability to serve as a technologically advanced classroom. In addition, there may be a library as well as a separate area that would house computers. Yatrakis said that there is an ""outside time"" of two years for completion of the office. In December, architectural plans for the renovations of Hamilton will be submitted for approval, at which point the College will create a final blueprint for the new office. Construction will begin in May and be primarily completed during the summers. The goal for the completion of the renovation is the 2001-02 academic year, Yatrakis said. Facilities managers have said that Lion's Court will be used as a home for construction workers until the Hamilton renovation project is completed.Future Director of the Core Eileen Gillooly and her associates will be moved to a new office Hamilton."
281,English Copes With Increased Enrollment,3 November 1999,"By CHARLES LANDOW Spectator Staff WriterDespite a growing student enrollment in the College and a shrinking number of professors, the English Department has increased its course offerings andkept its average under-graduate class size fairly steady over the last six years. With the Administration's Enlargement and Enhancement program in effect, incoming College classes are getting larger every year, and departments such as English (long one of the most popular majors) must try harder to meet students' needs. As they try, classes can balloon, instructors can become overworked, and small seminars must sometimes close their doors to more students. And in the English Department, infighting has become a serious concern, evidenced by the recent retirement of Edward W. Tayler. In each of the four most popular College majors, which also includes economics, history, and political science, there has developed a correlation between the departments' desires to keep course offerings high and class sizes relatively low, and the Administration's ability to meet the departments' needs. According to Martin Meisel, the Brander Matthews professor of English and Comparative Literature and the department's chair, the English faculty hasshrunk in the last 15 years from about 60 members to 42. ""There are constraints on hiring, replacements, and total numbers,"" said Meisel. ""And as you know, at the same time, the undergraduate enrollment, especially in the College, has increased."" Meisel took enrollment numbers as evidence that the department is handling the College's enlargement well. The numbers from the registrar's office show average class enrollment for English 1000-3000-level courses during the fall term climbing only slightly, from 21.5 students per class in the fall of 1994 to 23.5 students per course this year. This year's fall numbers are based on enrollment numbers before the drop date, unlike those of previous years. Average enrollment in spring English courses has declined, from 24.2 students per class in spring 1995 to 21.7 students last spring. During this same period of time, course offerings have increased. In the fall of 1994, the department offered 60 1000-3000 level courses, compared to 65 currently; spring offerings have increased from 61 in 1995 to 68 last term. In speaking about course offerings, Ann Douglas, the Parr professor of English and Comparative Literature, was quick to mention increased faculty workload when explaining the numbers. ""You're talking about the fact that fewer people are doing more work,"" she said. Douglas explained that each department has a number of spots, known as ""lines,"" for tenured and untenured faculty members. When a faculty member is hired by the University, he or she is given the title ""assistant professor."" After four years, the professor is reevaluatedand may be offered the ""associate"" professor title. After eight years, the professor may be offered tenure. While all departments have growing needs as the College increases its enrollment, Douglas said some have been more successful than others at having the Administration fulfill the department's desires. ""I'm not saying it's an unfair process; I just think that we've been on the short end of the stick for a while,"" she said.According to Meisel, the department is currently searching for two new junior faculty members, one to teach global English-language literature, and the other for 18th-centu-ry literature. David Kastan, professor of English and Comparative Literature, is relieved that the Administration, which controls hiring, appears to be allowing the department to regain its full strength. ""I'm delighted the [hiring of replacements of these positions] has been authorized,"" he said. ""It was starting to be a concern for me."" Michael Rosenthal, professor of English and Comparative Literature and former associate dean of the College, joined his colleagues in hoping that the Arts and Sciences administration will allow more English appointments in the next few years. ""In theory and practice, the more people the merrier,"" he said. Yet Rosenthal said he is skeptical that the department will be able to meet desired numbers of under-graduate course offerings and, at the same time, handle its graduate program and its stated commitment to the Core. It is true that the graduate English enrollment has decreased, Rosenthal said, but added that this does not necessarily translate into professors being diverted to undergraduate courses. Rosenthal cited graduate students' needs to have a full range of course offerings to prepare them for their careers and the greater necessary time commitment for professors with graduate students than with undergraduates. Therefore, he said, ""I'm not sure what the scale of faculty reassignment is."" With this desire to increase the number of professors, infighting has been of particular concern for the English Department. Tayler, a veteran professor and popular Shakespeare teacher who retired in June, harshly criticized the department's faculty for its handling of the Logic and Rhetoric curriculum, which he developed. Douglas and Kastan acknowledged that English instructors often debate the best way to teach their disciplines, but neither one expressed alarm or frustration about any reported infighting. ""It's a funny department. It's a sort of feisty and fractious department,"" said Kastan. ""We occasionally tip over the edge."" However, he added, ""It's New York; we're used to getting on subways and pushing and shoving, and we sort of do that to each other."" Asked if she was annoyed with the department's atmosphere, Douglas exclaimed, ""I came from Princeton, oh please! And before that Harvard, golly!"" Douglas said that other Ivy League English faculties have just as much debate but that they often try to keep the fighting quiet—""especially Princeton,where everybody is so polite and knifing each other behind their backs. Here, conflict is in the open, in the hallways and in the meetings. To me, that's so preferable. Here, you know where you stand. Give me the truth any day."" Kastan, who previously taught at Dartmouth, agreed. ""The department at Dartmouth, I think, was more overtly congenial, more overtly collegial, but also much less interesting. And if that's the trade-off, hell! That's easy,"" he said. Another pressure on the English Department is its responsibility to teach Core classes, especially Literature Humanities. Meisel said about one-fourth of full-time faculty members teach the Core. According to departmental records, over the past several years the English Department has taught nearly half of Literature Humanities sections, although the percentage has declined from 47 percent [5O sections] in 1993-94, to 40 percent [46 sections] in 1997-98, the last year for which statistics are available. In 1993-94, there were 105 sections of Literature Humanities, and in 1997-98 there were 114.The number of tenured and emeriti English professors teaching Literature Humanities has risen during that period, from eight to 13. The number of assistant and associate professors during the same time dropped from 16 to seven, and the number of graduate student preceptors decreased from 24 to 22. The"
282,Butler New Media Center to Expand,15 November 1999,"By DAVID GERRARD Spectator Staff WriterLewisohn Hall, home to the School of General Studies, will soon house electronic classrooms and other advanced technologies as the Butler Library-based Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL) opens its new branch in the building next month. Staff members at the new centerwill provide workshops and individual tutorials for faculty members on integrating technology into their courses. CCNMTL's Lewisohn branch is the first of the planned non-Butler ""storefront"" locations intended to allow faculty easier access to its resources. Future spots will include the Health Sciences campus in the spring and Hamilton Hall in the next year. CCNMTL's goal, according to its Associate Director Cory Brandt, is to help faculty be creative in using class web pages and other new technologies. Brandt said they hope faculty members will ""go beyond just posting the syllabus on theclass homepage."" General Studies Dean Peter Awn said he wants to make technology easier for faculty to understand. ""There are some faculty for whom new technology is very daunting,"" Awn said. ""This will help them get up to speed."" Brandt said that creative use of technology should help students carry their coursework with them outside of class via class bulletin boards posted on the Web. ""Once people fan out and go about their business, they can still be part of the class conversation,"" he said.Awn said this is not just jazzy technology, and that CCNMTL and the electronic classroom will ""put technology at the service of education."" Awn said he is currently using CCNMTL's assistance to build a web page about St. Augustine for his section of Literature Humanities. 'The text will have a thousand links; students will able to see the historical, social, and literary context for the work in a way they couldn't before,"" he said. Beyond web pages and bulletin boards, CCNMTL will use technology during General Studies core classes as a springboard for this initiative. According to Director of New Technologies Frank Moretti, the electronic classroom will be equipped with connections for laptop computers and videoconferencing. ""If you're teaching a Core class and you want someone at Stanford to give a half-hourpresentation, you'll be able to,"" Moretti said. The classroom will also have an electronic whiteboard—a computer monitor on which you can write and then erase with a digital pen. General Studies' small student population, compared to the other schools at Columbia, makes it easier for its students to take part in the pilot program, Awn said. ""With the College, you'd have to do 200 sections of everything,"" he said. The former Learning Center on the sixth floor of Lewisohn will become the Digital Tutoring Lab and move to the third floor. The Digital Tutoring Lab will make use of computer programs, including sophisticated interactive language programs, to aid in language tutoring. The Digital Tutoring Lab will also take over the old General Studies Student Council (GSSC) office and other social space on the same floor. The GSSC is now located in Lerner Hall."
283,History Department Deals With Professor Shortages,16 November 1999,"By NICK SCHIFRIN Spectator Associate News EditorFive years into the College's initiative to expand the size of the undergraduate body, Columbia's History Department finds itself having to withstand pressures on many fronts, pressures that are responsible for the fact that there are fewer courses available to history majors this fall than there were five years ago. On one hand, Department Chair Martha Howell says the department —Columbia's third largest—is trying to maintain traditional numbers of course offerings despite a decreasing number of professors in the department. On the other hand, there is ashrinking pool of graduate students that the department can use as teachers or teaching assistants, and not enough money to pay them. What complicates matters further is that history professors need to teach more Core sections than they did in the past due to the increasing enrollment of Columbia College, Howell and other professors say But while it may seem that the department can be compared to a ship trying to navigate a stormy sea without a crew, Howell says concerns about staffing are in part being addressed by the current search for three additional professors. She added, though, that the department needs at least four more professors in the future to avoid an even greater slip in course offerings. Course Offerings The number of history courses, including lectures and seminars, offered to undergraduates has decreased since the College implemented a program in 1995-96 aimed to enlarge enrollment by 15 percent. According to the University registrar, the History Department is offering 32 courses to undergradu-ates this term, compared to the 42 available in the fall of 1994—approximately a 25 percent drop. This drop coincided with a roughly three percent decrease in the total number of students in history classes. This academic year, for example, there are four lecture courses available in the Ancient and Medieval Studies section of the department. Although there were four lecture courses offered in the 1998-99 academic year as well, nearly double that number were offered on a regular basis during the previous few years. In Modern European Studies, there are eight courses available this academic year. Between 199394 and 1998-99, the average number of courses offered was 10, and only once were fewer than nine offered (in 1997-98, when there were eight courses). Under the Middle East, African, and Latin American section of the department, there have been eight course offerings in the last three academic years. Previous to that, there were 10 offerings in the 199697 and 1995-96 academic years, 12 in 1994-95, and eight again in 199394. However, course offerings for the spring terms have not followed the same trend of fall offerings. In the spring of 1999, there were 42 history courses available to undergraduates, up from 40 in the spring of 1994. The increase was accompanied by an approximate one percent decrease in the number of students in those courses. Howell says that there are three primary reasons for the overall decrease in course offerings: a shrinking body of professors, expanding obligations on those professors to teach Core classes, and a self-interest to deepen the major and offer more courses co-taught by multiple professors. Understaffing History professors say the department is severely understaffed. ""We've been shrunk. We have limited resources,"" said MarciaWright, a member of the history department since 1966. Howell discussed the decrease in professors, attributing it to a greater number of faculty who are shared by departments and retirements that have not been met with the hiring of any new professors. ""If you just do a body count,treating everyone who teaches part or full time in history ... as though they were a full body, we had about49 bodies,"" in the 1989-90 academic year. She said there are 44 this academic year. Howell explained the difficulty in relying on these numbers alone, saying that many faculty members are on ""split lines,"" meaning that they teach in the History Department as well as in another department, or vice versa. Howell said the decline in professors is greater than five because there were an additional 10 professors who were either on split lines or who belonged to other departments and taught a history course in 1989-90, and there are only five this academic year. Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen, who is ultimately responsible for the money allotted to hire professors, said that a more accurate means of measuring the professors teaching history courses is by using Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs). An FTE is a measure of the number of professors that converts parttime faculty members to fractions of full-time faculty members based on their contributions to a particular department. Cohen said there were 43.3 FTEs teaching history courses inthe 1992-93 academic year, and that there are 42.5 this academic year. Cohen said that he did not have statistics on the years prior to the 1992-93 academic year, and noted that a measure of numbers of professors in the 1989-90 academic year is somewhat inflated because of a University-widespike in hiring during the late 'Bos. Obligations and Class Size Moore Collegiate Professor of History Isser Woloch, who has been in the department for 30 years, said that maintaining a variety of course offerings available to undergraduates ""has become very difficult with[the requirements of] service courses and Core sections. It gives us less latitude."""
284,Professor Accuses Univ. Security of Harassment,17 November 1999,"By ARTHUR HARRIS Spectator Staff WriterUnder guard in a back room of Columbia Security's Low Library office is the last place Professor Gayatri Spivak expected to spend a Saturday evening. Spivak, the Avalon Foundation Professor in Humanities, and Lecia Rosenthal, a Ph.D. candidate and Literature Humanities preceptor, claim they were harassed and unnecessarily detained by security for an hour and a half on Saturday, Nov. 6. ""It was a very traumatic experience,"" Spivak said in an interview on Monday. ""But I've never felt betrayed by my own institution before."" Spivak has taught at the University for eight years and in the United States for 35. The catalyst for Saturday's incident was a confrontation Spivak and Rosenthal had with a group of women who alleged that the two had stolen a wallet. While walking out of Labyrinth Books at approximately 6:30 p.m., Spivak and Rosenthal encountered a woman who said Rosenthal fit the description of a woman who had stolen a wallet in a restaurant. An uninvolved party said the thief was a ""woman in a ski cap."" Rosenthal was wearing a ski cap at the time. Outside Labyrinth, the accuser demanded Spivak and Rosenthal go with her to the police. They refused and the accuser began shrieking at passers by to call the police, Spivak said. The woman, unaffiliated with the University, who accused Spivak and Rosenthal, followed them to the Hungarian Pastry Shop where the two were going to read. According to Spivak, ""The woman waited outside where she was joined by three or four friends. We could see them talking to the police, who must have told them they couldn't do anything because[the police officers] left."" The group of women waited for Spivak and Rosenthal to leave and followed them north on Amsterdam Ave. The women then began screaming that the wallet must now be in Spivak's back pack and that Spivak, who is from India and speaks with a British accent, was a ""foreigner and would claim diplomatic immunity,"" Rosenthal said. At that point Spivak and Rosenthal approached the campus security guard at 116 th St. and Amsterdam to seek assistance and ""report the women who were harassing us,"" Rosenthal said. The two detailed their affiliation with Columbia and presented their IDs. The security guard called Lieutenant Espinal, the Columbia University shift commander at the time. Director of Columbia Security George Smartt said that by the time the parties reached campus security, ""the issue at hand was an esca-lating situation."" ""Espinal escorted the disputing parties to the Campus Security Office, where they could resolve the issue off the street,"" Smartt added. Spivak and Rosenthal, though, maintain that Columbia's security procedures were neither clear nor justified. The two said they explained to the officer at the 116 th St. gates that the group of women had already spoken with the police who dismissed the allegations. According to Spivak, at 116 th St. and Amsterdam, Espinal then demanded that ""I open the back pack or we would have to go to the Security Office"" and have Columbia Security call the Police Department. When Spivak tried to call Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen upon her arrival at Low Library, another officer asked whom she was calling. According to Spivak, the officer said, ""You have to tell me. This is a campus phone."" She and Rosenthal were then hustled off into a back room, underconstant guard of a security officer, Spivak said Assistant Director of Investigations for Security James Lynch said that surveillance is standard procedure if someone is suspected of theft. The two spent their hour-and-a-half stay grading papers on the floor, until the police arrived, at which point the police officer asked Spivak to open her bag. When she refused, he said she was not required to open it in any case. The officer added, ""It's okay, I don't think you did it anyway,"" which Spivak called ""the first sign anyone showed any confidence in us."" Smartt said that the initial investigation indicates that all security personnel involved acted according to procedure. Because the alleged theft took place off campus— outside the jurisdiction of Columbia Security, the security officers made the correct move ""to call the NYPD and letthose with the right to make the decision make the decision,"" Lynch said. Spivak and Rosenthal both thought Columbia Security did not acknowledge their complaints of harassment against the group of women and failed to recognize that the women's accusations were based on hearsay evidence. ""I felt shock and dismay,"" Rosenthal said, ""as I watched Columbia Security legitimate this group of women's unsubstantiated, calumnious remarks by detaining Professor Spivak and myself... It does seem particularly egregious to me that once informed of our status as members of the Columbia community, the officers in no way registered any respect for that affiliation."" Other faculty members were equally upset. Chair of the Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Department Hameed Dabashi said, ""I am appalled with the behavior of Columbia Security because they arethere for protection of the Columbia community. If we don't have safety from harassment in our own campus, I don't know where else we're going to have it."" Lynch though, said that the purpose of Columbia Security is not to act as personal bodyguards for University affiliates and speculated that ""what [Spivak and Rosenthal] may have been responding to is that the officers remained neutral. Columbia Security has to treat everyone equally, regardless of their affiliation or status at Columbia."" Lynch added that had the security officers not called the police, the accusing party would have complained of Columbia Security's bias. Spivak questioned the motivation behind Security's behavior. Maybe I am paranoid, but I do not believe CU Security would have behaved this way towards a white male professor,"" she said. Lynch, who is AfricanAmerican, discounted this allega-tion. ""I can assure you there has never been an experience like that at Columbia University from a racial standpoint, at least while I've been here."" Still, Rosenthal questioned Security. 'Try to imagine a situation in which President Rupp, walking on Columbia Campus, is stopped under similar circumstances and aggressively told that he must either heed the unlawful request to show the contents of his briefcase or be taken into the security office in Low Library. No, one cannot imagine such a situation; it would simply not happen, as it should not."" Lynch said that the whole incident was ""blown out of proportion."" The incident is currently under investigation by the Columbia Administration. All parties made their comments prior to the investigation. Lieutenant Espinal did not comment. Security did not release the names of the accusing women."
285,GS Colloquia Receive School-Wide Acclaim,19 November 1999,"By DAVID GERRARD Spectator Staff WriterAfter four semesters of a new type of interdisciplinary academic program in the School of General Studies (GS), students and faculty are giving the new courses glowing reviews. Pilot classes for the General Studies colloquia—small discussion courses currently in their second full year—introduce students to an interdisciplinary approach to literature, philosophy, and the social sciences. The GS colloquia are modeled on the College's ""great books"" courses, Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and Contemporary Civilization (CC), but focus on specific intellectual eras and are cotaught by two instructors, one from the humanities and one from the social sciences. Texts traditionally dealt with separately by Lit Hum and CC are studied simultaneously in the GS colloquia.The College recently suspended its own colloquia program, which included courses that served as an extension of the Core but in recent years was plagued by understaffing. The colloquia offered by GS are organized according to era. They include Ancient/Classical Traditions, The Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution, which will be joined by a class, still under development, on the Modern Era. According to General Studies Dean Peter Awn, having two instructors and focusing on a specific time period in colloquia ameliorates a central problem of Lit Hum and CC, namely that the texts cover such a broad time frame that no one instructor can be an expert in all of them. ""I'm great first semester of Lit Hum, but what can I teach about Boccaccio if I don't know anythingabout Italian literature, which I don't?"" he said. Awn added that while the colloquia are still focused on the West, they also incorporate some Eastern texts as well. Eurocentrism is a common student criticism of Lit Hum and CC. ""When looking at the Gospel according to John, we also looked at some contemporary Eastern texts, and saw how there was just this worldwide search for a savior at that period in time,"" said colloquia student Mark Moran, GS 'Ol. General Studies Student Council President Chris Smith, GS 'OO, who is taking Awn's Lit Hum section and took two colloquia last year, agreed. ""I'm enjoying Lit Hum because Awn's teaching it, but it can't compare to the colloquia. The colloquia are amazing. The professors are experts in the texts they teach, so they really know what they're talking about,"" he said. English Department Lecturer John Axcelson, who is teaching the colloquium on Enlightment to the Industrial Revolution, praised the program's interdisciplinary nature. ""It's as if you have Lit Hum and CC in dialogue with each other. You can have literature challenge philosophy and philosophy challenge literature,"" he said. Texts covered by his section include Locke's Second Treatise, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and Rousseau's Confessions, as well as works by Marx and Darwin.Axcelson also cited the colloquia's ability to allow students to see how specialists from different disciplines approach texts. ""I co-teach with a philosopher, so students can see how a literary critic approaches philosophy and a philosopher approaches literature,"" he said. Jonathan Adams, GS 'Ol, who has taken several colloquia, agreed. ""Because the instructors are specialists in different disciplines and time periods, you get them catching each other up. One can be talking about an idea most people think comes from the Renaissance, and the other can point out that the idea really started in the Middle Ages,"" he said The colloquia are well suited to GS students for two reasons, Awn said. First, each colloquium is one semester, which allows GS students, who often for personal and job-related reasons need to take semesters off, to be able to take the classes without worrying about missing a second sequential semester, as students in Lit Hum might. Second, many GS students have already had college experience during which they have been introduced to some of the texts studied in Lit Hum and CC, making the broad overview style of those courses redundant. For those reasons, ""it is important not to mimic Columbia College"" in how GS structures its Core, Awn said.The colloquia are designed to be writing intensive, and students typically write one short paper each week and three longer papers each semester. ""It's an enormous amount of work and a lot of students feel pushed to the limit, but no one is buckling under,"" Axcelson said. General Studies Dean of Students Andrea Solomon, who is teaching a colloquium on the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, said that the difficulty of the classes leads only very talented students to take them. Solomon said that because each student in her section is required to write a 1-2 page reader response for each section, every student in her class does the reading for each class, which is not always the case in Lit Hum and CC. ""I went to Columbia College [as an undergraduate], and I didn't always do the reading,"" she said. ""I'm teaching Don Quixote now; the first book alone is 460 pages, and everyone's read it. That leads to a very high level of class discussion. I steer discussions, but the onus is really on the students themselves."" In the future, GS administrators hope to have more professors from more departments teaching the colloquia. ""It would be nice to bring in people from History. We're talking to people in various departments now,"" she said."
286,Core Remains Prize Jewel In Columbia's Crown,22 November 1999,"By CHARLES LANDOW Spectator Staff WriterIn an era of change, with construction dotting the campus, entering classes expanding, and departments moving to accommodate more students, Columbia College has remained steadfast in its insistence that every student complete the Core Curriculum. Even though some departments are making do with fewer profes-sors than they have had in the past, courses in the Core have remained small and, according to many of the instructors who teach them, relatively problem-free. ""It has never been better taken care of,"" J & G Siegel Professor of the Humanities Cathy Popkin said about the Core. Popkin, who also teaches in the Department of Slavic Languages, is the chair of Literature Humanities (Lit Hum). Eileen Gillooly, who as director of the Core manages all of its administrative aspects, agreed withPopkin. Despite growing College enrollment, the Core has maintained its small classes and will keep them, she said. ""With these kinds of pressures that the College is under, a lot of attention is being paid to the Core, so I'm not actually worried."" Interviews with 20 instructors of Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization (CC) revealed that, while individual departments may have their problems, most regard Lit Hum and CC as oases, sanctuaries from larger lecture classes. And their students agree. Nathania Nisonson, CC 'O3, said her Lit Hum class was ""a perfect size."" She said her teacher, a senior professor, often lets students lead the discussion. ""It's very good because it's not the professor talking the whole time,"" she said. Core administrators also spoke about closer integration of Lit Hum and CC with the Major Cultures, Art, and Music Humanities courses that comprise the rest of the Core.Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that integration would be enhanced by the creation of a Core office, planned to open in the lobby of Hamilton Hall in the next few years. The current health of the Core has come about despite claims of understaffing by history and English professors in their departments. Each department is obliged to staff a certain number of sections in the Core, with English and History contributing the most professors to Lit Hum and CC classes, respectively. These obligations, which have been increasing due to an enlarged enrollment in the College, are putting a strain on course offerings for majors in those departments but at the same time are maintaining the health of the Core. Still, there are two main concerns with the Core's continued strength: the size of sections and the percentage of senior faculty teaching them. Yatrakis said that the desired enrollment for each Lit Hum and CC section is 22. This year's average enrollment in Lit Hum courses is 20.5, and 21.4 in CC courses. Most of the instructors interviewed thought the size of theirclasses was appropriate. Professor of Classics Eleanor Dickey, whose CC section has an enrollment of 21 students, said, ""The size seems ideal, actually. I normally prefer small classes, but in CC a smaller class would make discussion harder —you need some diversity of opinion to get a good discussion."" Besides class sizes, another issue of discussion about the Core has been the ratio of senior tenured professors to junior nontenured professors and graduate student preceptors. Yatrakis said the University's goal is to have Lit Hum and CC sections taught by one-third senior faculty, one-third junior faculty, and one-third preceptors. Yatrakis said that even if the College wereable to fill each Core section with a senior faculty member, they would instead maintain the stated goal in an effort to have a ""multi-gen-erational"" staff of Core teachers. Some students have said they would prefer being taught by a senior faculty member, and some senior professors have said the level of the University's dedication to the Core is shown by the percentage of senior professors teaching Core classes. Others, though, say that senior professors are not necessarily better teachers than junior faculty or preceptors. Justin Marks, CC 'O2, who has a preceptor for CC, said about his instructor, ""I don't have any qualms about his status [as a preceptor], because he's so knowledgeable."" Of the 50 sections of CC offeredthis semester, 10 (20 percent) are taught by senior professors, 18 (36 percent) by junior faculty, 19 (38 percent) by graduate preceptors, and one by a part-time administrator in the Office of Alumni Relations. Of 55 Lit Hum sections, 12 (22 percent) are taught by senior faculty, 22 by junior faculty (40 percent), and 20 by preceptors (36 percent). (Attempts by the Spectator to find the teachers of the remaining two CC sections and one Lit Hum class were unsuccessful.) Not everyone is convinced, however, that more senior faculty would improve the quality of the Core. Popkin, the Lit Hum chair, called the preceptors who teach the Core ""the cream of the cream of the cream of the graduate student crop. They are so smart it's terrifying,"" she said. ""I don't think the program would be served by reducing the number of preceptors. I think they breathe life into the program."" Professor of Political Science Douglas Chalmers, who teaches CC, said, ""I think graduate students are often better teachers than professors. I don't think the ratio is a problem. I think they ought to continue to urge seniors to teach, but it isn't a crisis."" Bonnie Kent, a religion professor who also teaches a section of CC, said that senior professors have more experience than preceptors, but added that graduate students are apt to pay more attention to their sections. For a preceptor, Kent said, a Core class is ""like your first child. ""If your section coughs twice orlooks frightful, you panic. That level of attention fades with age,"" Kent said. Though the ratio is not now cause for concern, some instructors still said that more senior faculty should give the Core a try. Professor of Islamic History Richard Bulliet said, ""As I see it, what other university would allow their professor of Islamic history to conduct a class on Plato, St. Augustine, Michelangelo, and Virginia Woolf?"" Bulliet currently teaches a section of Lit Hum and has taught CC and Art Humanities in the past. The interviewed professors said the main reason few tenured professors teach the Core is that there are far fewer incentives for them to do so than there are for younger instructors. Dean of the College Austin Quigley said that the College has created a set of endowed chairs that would give senior faculty a monetary incentive to teach the Core.Quigley said that the chairs are given to faculty members, selected by their peers, for five years. In a speech given at the Hamilton Awards last Wednesday evening, Quigley said three new chairs had recently been established, and that two are about to be established."

288,perspectives Demographic Diversity and Courses Offerings,1 December 1999,"Demographic Diversity and Courses OfferingsBy TIZOC BRENES Spectator Staff Writeri m PgjwMffT \ <■ ' $ . v ;:f; : A historic look at area studies from the days where ""Oriental"" studies encompassed Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern cultures, show that a change in student demographics brought about changes in course offer-The campus at Columbia is populated by symbols of its original purpose—to educate the elite white males of this country Hamilton Hall, a Rodin statue, and the names carved across Butler Library are all reminders of the heritage of this university. Though the look of the campus architecture has undergone few changes in the past 200 years, the look of the student body has dramatically altered. With the change in the university's demographics has come a change in the educational goals of this university. Fluency in Ancient Greek and Latin are no longer admissions requirements, women live and study in the dorms that they were once required to visit only with a chaperone, and the strength of an incoming class is no longer contingent on the number of sons of alumni that is in it. The curriculum is perhaps what best reflects the changing student population. A few classes in foreign languages have bloomed into area-studies departments. Student petitions andrallies have become programs in Women's Studies and Ethnic Studies. Even the Core Curriculum has made modifications to accommodate the diversity of the student population. The Origins Fields of study that add diversity to the curriculum each have their origin in a different period of time, beginning with the 18th century. In the 19th century, European and American imperialism generated interest that led to the creation of earlier forms of area studies departments, including East Asian Studies, Latin American Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, and African Studies. At Columbia, according to the University Bulletin, ""what were then called 'Oriental languages'"" were being taught as early as 1780. The Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Program, however, was not created until 1901. According to Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Program Chair Professor David Wang, the original intent of his program was to introduce the regions to the students, who were then all white males. In the 19th century, most departments dealing with the Middle East were called Oriental or Semitic Studies, according to Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures Professor George Saliba. In its earlier days, Middle Eastern Studies grew aroundBible studies because ""languages cognate with ancient Hebrew have a bearing on the understanding of the Bible,"" Saliba said. The emergence of area studies programs as permanent fields of studies offered at universities coincided with the success of the United States in World War II and the end of American isolationism, according to Saliba. 'The Second World War gave them the feeling that somehow they were responsible for the world"" —a feeling that, according to Saliba, the imperialist Dutch, French, and British powers shared before. ""[Area studies] grew out of the need of this country to understand the world strategically and to understand what goes on in these geographies,"" Saliba said. Because these studies treated distinct cultures as one area of study, for example, Islamic civilizations with Hindu civilizations, he said, ""you ended up juxtaposing a lot of rubrics."" A regional study within the United States, American Studies, has its origins much earlier than the Cold War, which some believe instigated the study as a response to the threat against American security. Director of American Studies Professor Casey Blake explained that the discipline's true origins lay in the 1910s, when it emerged out of the ""social ferment of the Depression."" ""American Studies as a field was the product of a rich and contentious debate about American citizenship and national identity,"" he said. Ethnic Studies and Women's Studies were pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the sentiment that students' education be relevant to their experiences, said Professor Gary Okihiro, director of the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race. Though the way by which cultures are studied has transformed over the years, an older school of thought lingers, especially in area studies. Cultures are still grouped according to their geography and studied this way, according to both Saliba and Wang. ""I am not happy with the geographic terminology,"" Salibasaid. The terms ""Middle East"" and ""Near East"" originate from a military concern for a geographic area and not for a particular culture, he said. Originally, the ""Orient"" encompassed Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern cultures, but there are now two departments: East Asian Studies and Middle Eastern Studies. East Asian Studies is broken up into Japanese, Korean, and Chinese studies. A geographical approach may not be the best, Wang said, because of all the cultural, linguistic, and historical differences between countries. Saliba said it is dangerous to value places over people. ""When you divide the world by geography, people become less interesting,"" he said. There is no ""European Studies"" department, he said, because there is an understanding that the various cultures are too complex to be housed under one department. Saliba pointed out that the original name of Major Cultureswas the ""Extended Core"" (The name was changed in 1994.) because the initial attitude of the University was that the requirement should be part of the Core. Students Change, Courses Change The changing demographics in universities had important effects on the formation and solidification of American Studies. ""It's not accidental that American Studies flourished with the passing of the GI Bill of Rights, allowing working class men access to higher education,"" Blake said. At that time, the ""democratization"" of the University by class took place. American Studies also responded to the growing number of women and students of color entering universities. ""During the 19605, many American Studies programs became laboratories for other interdisciplinary programs,"" Blake said, pointing to Women's Studies and African American Studies (or Black Studies, as the program was called then), both of which had roots in American Studies. ""American Studies in the post-war period was an open field where a number of new interdisciplinary ventures were organized or designed,"" he said. With the enrollment of students of color at the University, a change in teaching ideology in area studies departments has also taken place. Asian studies could no longer teach to ""enrich"" students because Asian students were taking the courses also. The Spanish Department could no longer teach a ""foreign"" language to students because native Spanish speakers were taking courses to improve their writing and speaking skills. Wang admitted that there are different needs and agendas that become represented by each student who takes a course in Asian Studies or Middle Eastern Studies. In the Chinese language program, for example, there arethree separate tracks: one for students with no background in Chinese, one for those with no background but who come from a Chinese family, and one for those with Chinese language background.""[This] shows the complexity of how we want to better teach our students. Truly, the issue is still evolving,"" Wang said. In the past 20 years, the number of second and third generation American-born Asian students has grown, Wang said. These students study history, language, and culture courses offered by the department—some with prior knowledge and others with none at all. But the department accommodates both types of students. Wang said the number of students taking courses offered by"
289,1923 College Discovers an Ideology and Changes,13 December 1999,"""We are here to gain a firmer message upon the realities of life, to get knowledge and to transmit it into wisdom, to find new understanding and to be guided to new interpretations, both of nature and of life and of organized man.""Although Nicholas Murray Butler's 1919 commencement speech was not directly addressing the College's brand new Contemporary Civilization course, his lofty sense of purpose for the University reflected Columbia's search for explanations of the unparalleled destruction caused by World War I. The faculty members who created the first class in Columbia's Core Curriculum in January of 1919 believed that an understanding of the present was predicated on the understanding of the philosophy and events of the past. Twenty years previously, a controversy raged in Columbia as the school began to drift toward what today's students would call a pre-profes-sional education, moving away from its traditional focus on liberal arts. The cause for an education that rooted itself in classical Western thought was championed by Professor John Howard Van Amringe, a reject of Columbia's 1890s Greek and Latin department and a mathematics professor who had a reputation for ""favoring athletes over serious students,"" according to An Oasis of Order, Timothy Cross's book on the Core Curriculum. Van Amringe wanted a liberal curriculum ""to teach [students] to look before and after, and in general to use their minds in ways which are appropriate to civil existence."" But Van Amringe, teaching at Columbia at the turn of the century, would fail at his attempt to shape the University into a haven of liberal arts that produced ""gentlemen.""It took until the First World War and a ""war issues"" course, offered at the request of the United States Army for their Student Army Training Corps, to stop the institution's slide toward pre-professional training. But by the time ""war issues"" became Contemporary Civilization in 1919, Van Amringe's lofty statement had been replaced by the desire to educate students who have knowledge of and question contemporary politics. ""The idea rests upon the belief that each new generation as it grows into maturity needs to be aware of the problems of its own group,"" said John J. Coss, first director of the CC program. ""And [they] should be brought to some appreciation of its responsibility within that group."" It is ""an attempt so to inform the students that their social usefulness will be increased in proportion as they follow the methods of intelligent investigation and discrimination,"" said then-Columbia College Dean Herbert Hawkes. Today, as Columbia celebrates the Core's 80th birthday, Van Amringe's statement is an ideal philosophy that attempts to give purpose to Columbia's College insistence that its students take CC, along with Literature, Music and Art Humanities. Coupled with the additions of Logic and Rhetoric and distribution requirements in Major Cultures, science, foreign languages, and physical education, the Core provides the undergraduate College with a universal identity. ""Having this very solid undergraduate education prepares you for life,"" saidDirector of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly. Because every undergraduate in the college must take the full Core Curriculum, it provides a common academic experience for all students to share with one another. Cross said that these required classes give students a common vocabulary ofthe means for intellectual 4f discourse. The ""war issues"" class was in part created to explore the issues surrounding the current conflict in Europe. The end of the war marked the shift in ideology from war issues to issues that concerned American citizens in times of peace, and was temporarily renamed ""peace issues"" and then ""Contemporary Civilization."" The move to institute a mandatory general education course was met with opposition by some faculty members. Many professors felt that the proper mission of a University was to prepare students for future professional work and that a liberal arts education was becoming superfluous in an increasingly modern world. In turned out that CC proved so popular that a second year was added in 1928. The freshman course, CCA, focused on historical issues that shaped the present, while the second year, entitled CC-B, focused on current political and economic problems. However, CC-B proved less popular among students than CC-A. After persisting for a number of years, a 1959 committee recommended that the course no longer be required. The University followed this suggestion in 1961. At the same time that CC was flourishing, Columbia added a General Honors course in 1920 at the behest of Professor of English John Erskine, 'OO. The precursor toOLiterature Humanities, the course was a two-year sequence offered to elite students who passed examina-tions and received personal recommendations from professors. The course consisted of small discussion groups reading well-known works of literature in translation, as Literature Humanities does now, but was discontinued when a second year of CC was added to the curriculum. Given the success of CC in the early '3os, Professor Mark Van Doren led a movement to add a sequence of literature courses to the general education program. The first course entitled Humanities A and later renamed Literature Humanities (Lit Hum), began in 1937 and was required for first-years. The syllabus incuded literature that dated back to medieval times. The second required course, Humanities B, was devoted to fine arts and music and was to be taken in the sophomore year. In 1941, Humanities B was split into two separate semester-long classes that covered art and music individually. Music and Art Humanities became a required component of the Core Curriculum in 1947. There have been several failed attempts to add a science course similar in scope to the humanities to the Core. As early as 1934, Hawkes oversaw the development of an optional two-year science sequence. Loosely modeled after CC, the courses provided a general education in the natural sciences. In 1941, however, with faculty focusing their efforts on World War 11, Science A and B were dropped. Since then, other attempts to addft* general, inclusive science classes to the core have been unsuccessful. According to Cross, among others, science often involves lab work, and thus it would be difficult to offer nonspecific overview courses. The Core thrived in the years following World War 11, solidifying its place in the College and in Western education. Administrators and professors from other universities regularly took trips to Columbia to observe its famed Core. Humanities A and CC sections were taught by some of the College's most distinguished faculty members, including Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, '25. Adding to the Core's influence within the University was the 1959 decision to require engineering students to take some Core classes. However, the Core did have its opponents. Increasingly, students and faculty denounced Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization as the study of dead white males. In the aftermath of the 1968 protests, students deemed the Core to be conservative, Eurocentric, and irrelevant. In 1970, a committee headed by Professor Robert Belknap proposed replacing Core classes with distribution requirements. In response to the committee's suggestion to end CC, the editors of the alumni publication Columbia College Today wrote: ""Even if the course is still basically sound, its eventual disappearance would not necessarily be a tragedy."" In retrospect, Professor William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, described the committee's recommendations as ""insignificant"" and said that the Administration never seriously considered implementing the plan. In 1988, a committee headed by de Bary asserted that CC and Lit Hum should maintain a Western focus and recommended that the Core be extended to include new courses that would examine Asian and African civi-"

However, there was a time in the not too distant past when Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization classes were filled entirely with! freshmen and sophomore ! males, when the Light Blue ! represented only male athletes, and when even Carman | Hall was home to only fresh- | men males. !

The talks were prompted by a concern over Columbia's ""sagging applicant pool"" which at that point was deemed the lowest in the Ivy League. By 1977, Columbia's peer Ivy institutions had all become coeducational. Thus Columbia was left standing as one of the country's last bastions of allmale post-secondary education. However, the school did not give such an appearance. ""I didn't know it wasn't coedwhen I applied,"" General Studies Assistant Dean of Students Andrea Solomon, CC 'B7, said. She said that when she got the acceptance letter it stated that she was among the first women students. Currently Director of Alumni Programming and Special Adviser to the Dean, Roger Lehecka was dean of Students from 1979 to 1998 and an early and persistent advocate for coeducation. Lehecka said there was widespread support for coeducation on the part of the faculty and students at least 10 years before it actually happened. However, despite these sentiments, Lehecka that said at the University level there was the feeling that if coeducation happened Barnard would be significantly hurt. Lehecka added that there were so many other problems Columbia was addressing in the 19705, such as concerns left over from the '6os about politic a 1divisions on the campus, and that ""those always took priority over addressing this."" ""It was a source of significant unhappiness here on the part of students that we were all male. If there was any student in the 70s or 'Bos who came here because we were a male college, I never met him,"" Lehecka said. Lehecka said that a lot of the high school recruiting implied that Columbiawas a coed college ""in fact or in substance if not in legality"" due to the high number of jointly offered courses and integration in student activities. He said that the brochures the admissions officers printed and the information that they provided to prospective students attempted to convince them that day-to-day life at Columbia would be coed even if the College technically was not. In retrospect, Lehecka said that when students became upperclassmen, this sort of integration was true but that the firstyear experience was limited to mostly allmale living arrangements and the required Core courses that were all male. ""I think a very large number of students felt they were betrayed because they were led to believe it was a different place than it turned out to be,"" Lehecka said. The University did make early attempts to grant women the chance to study outside of the College what the males were studying within the gates. In 1883 Columbia President Frederick A.P. Barnard printed ""The Higher Education of Women"" which urged the College to accept young women. While that idea was too radical for the institution at the time, later that year the College's Collegiate Course for Women was established for ""women desiring to avail themselves of a course of collegiate study, equivalent to the course given to youngmen in the college."" The duration of the program was four years, and students were free to choose where they would pursue their studies; many worked in schools or at home. If the work completed was deemed satisfactory, a B.A. would be conferred to the student. In 1887 the Trustees ratified an agreement to end these special degrees. Two years later the Columbia Trusteesapproved the founding of Barnard College. The first inklings of change within the College occurred in 1962 when, in an attempt to cut costs, Barnard and Columbia decided to offer courses jointly at no extra cost to either school. Then in September 1975 Dean of Columbia College Peter Pouncey recommended that the CC, BC, SEAS, and the School of General Studies be combined into a single undergraduate school. Barnard President Leßoy Breunig rejected this plan.'lt was a source of significant unhappiness here on the part of students that we were all male.

291,Curriculum At Penn To Change,24 January 2000,"By DAVID SOLOWAY Columbia Daily Spectator■ Penn officials to create Pilot Curriculum, but say it is it unrelated to CoreThe University of Pennsylvania's School of Arts and Sciences will institute an ""experimental general education curricu- < lum to asubset of 8 studentsfrom the School's Class of 2004, beginning this fall. Penn's new approach is a unique one, but its requirements are a far cry from Columbia's. There is no one course, like Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Logic & Rhetoric, and others, that every undergraduate student is required to complete, and Penn officials have made clear their belief that the program, called the Pilot Curriculum is not a core curriculum. Pilot Curriculum will run alongside Penn's regular curriculum for the next several years. The School of Arts and Sciences Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE) Chair Frank Warner characterized the curriculum as ""an experiment in undergraduate education that will provide a more compact and well-focused learning experience. ""We did not approach this revision project from the what's wrong with the current curriculum?' point of view,"" Warner said of Penn's first major curricular change in over 13 years. ""But the committee recognized that in order to ensure the success of the University for years to come, improvements were needed."" Members of Penn's incoming first-year class will be invited to participate in the new system and 200students will be selected at random from among the volunteers. The Pilot Curriculum will enable the School to identify how best to offer undergraduates a ""coherent and focused introduction"" to human knowledge across various academic fields, Deans Samuel H. Preston and Richard R. Beeman said in a press release issued just after the preliminary proposal was completed. Despite the curriculum's ""focused"" nature, Preston and Beeman have promised that the Pilot Curriculum will allow students enough freedom to pursue their own interests. ""Columbia certainly has an outstanding model, but our model is very different,"" Warner said. ""We are not instituting a 'core curriculum' and make no attempt to define a specific body of knowledge that all students must acquire."" Penn's new curriculum has four main components. They include four semester-long courses from four categories (structure and value in human societies; science, culture and society; earth, space and life; and imagination, representation and reality) to be taken during the first two years of study, an increased emphasis on oral communication, a significant research experience within the major, and ""thoughtful planning of the elective portion of a student's program."" ""It is important to see the Pilot Curriculum as a full set of degree requirements, not just a new scheme of four courses for the general education component,"" former President of the University and CUE committee member Sheldon Hackney said. Warner added that having stu-dents take the four general requirement courses by the end of their sophomore year gives them ""early exposure to the vast intellectual landscape of the university and to various modes of intellectual inquiry."" Students throughout the University have had mixed reactions toward the installation of the Pilot Curriculum. ""The system would do a good job of attempting to lead us down the right path while at the same time allowing us to take a wide range of courses and electives,"" Penn sophomore Alexis Sherman said. Other students are just glad that the new system will only affect later generations of Penn students. ""I don't have any specific objections to the proposed policy,"" Penn first-year Jeffrey Millman said. ""But I just think that the administrationshould give the students as much freedom with planning out our futures as possible."" Administrators and CUE committee members warn that the Pilot Curriculum is a work in progress, a plan with possible flaws that will no doubt be altered in the years to come. ""It is an experiment,"" Hackney said. ""Its outcome is uncertain. But I am among those who think the promises of the pilot curriculum are so substantial that we ought to give it our best try."" Changes to Penn's undergraduate curriculum were first considered during the fall semester of 1998, with an initial proposal presented to the faculty of the School of Arts and Sciences in the spring of 1999. A final decision to proceed with the experimental curriculum was made by the school's faculty in December.perspectives"
292,"Riots, Girls, and E-mail Prof. Michael Rosenthal Recalls 41 Years at CU",25 January 2000,"Prof. Michael Rosenthal Recalls 41 Years at CUBY THOMAS KELLY Columbia Daily SpectatorTucked away in a small hallway on the sixth floor of Philosophy Hall, Michael Rosenthal, a 41 year Columbia University veteran, keeps his office. The room is small and warm, brimming with shelves of books befitting an English professor. It is clean and neat, yet lived-in and comfortable; Professor Rosenthal isn't afraid to put his feet on the desk next to a jar of Hershey's chocolate kisses and some candy from the gummy family on his desk. A number of small, subdued paintings hang on the walls as well as a piece reading ""God Bless This School"" done in needlepoint. Wearing many hats in 4 decades as a Columbia student, administrator, and professor, Rosenthal has witnessed Columbia's evolution from the riots of the late '6os, through the battle for coeducation, to the arrival of the high-tech age and its e-minded students. However, it was a different world when Rosenthal came to Columbia as a graduate student in the English department in 1959 after graduatingfrom Harvard University and receiving a masters degree from the University of Wisconsin. ""In those days, though there was no war, there was a peacetime draft. One had a choice of either going to graduate school or being drafted, and I chose graduate school, which I think was not the right decision. I would not counsel that. Rather than simply rolling on in graduate school (in part) to avoid the draft, Iwould always urge people now to confront the draft. I should have gotten that out of the way and then confronted the issues of life."" After receiving his Ph.D., Rosenthal worked as an associate professor until 1972 when he became an associate dean, a position he held until 1989 when he returned to teaching. Since his return to the classroom, Rosenthal has made a point of teaching Literature Humanities. ""These are great and wonderful books. They are complicated books that challenge and question, and that seems to me in some ideal way to be what professors of literature ought to do."" he said. A steadfast defender of the Core, Rosenthal disagrees with the criticism it has come under in recent years. ""The core curriculum does not preach uncritical adulation of one's culture. In fact, it raises questions about the culture. I think that educat-Ed people ought to know where we've come from."" While the Core has remained a constant fixture at Columbia, the advent of the Internet and other technologies has fundamentally changed students' attitudes. ""I think computers and information and technology have replaced the notion that you can somehow get a fix on a culture through reading books. This is not a criticism, just an observation. I think students no longer feel ... that the way to understand the culture and to understand one's self and to find out about life was to read books. I think they still read them, obviously, but not with the same intensity and passion,"" he said. 'The world is moving at an extraordinarily rapid rate, and all these things that students can do with the information that is available to them is extraordinary. But, to me at least, one of the costs is that people don't snuggle up with Dostoevesky,"" he continued. Though the way in which students approach learning may have changed in Rosenthal's eyes, he finds the character of Columbia's student bodymuch the same as it always has been. ""The students at Columbia have always been interestingly idiosyncratic and not cut out of any single mold. They continue to be that way. They're bright, and they're tough minded."" One of the attractions of Columbia for many students today is the school's rich activist history. The riots of the late 1960s have taken on legendary status in the minds of many students. As an associate professor at the time of the riots, Rosenthal has a different attitude toward the era. ""It was not an exhilarating time ... it was awful. One became aware of how fragile the institution in fact is. People think of the university as this great sort of monolithic thing when in fact universities are fairly precariously situated places that require all sorts of consent. Suddenly, it all stopped. The campus was polarized. Everyone was doing his own thing. There wasmuch fantasy and much destructive behavior, and I don't look back on it as anything particularly productive. Alumni support dropped off. Faculty members' own confidence in what they were doing was severely undermined ... It was fascinating and riveting but terrible."" Since the riots of 1968, Columbia has gradually regained the strength it once held. A major factor in the move towards this goal was the admittance of women to Columbia College. During his time as an associate dean, Rosenthal played prominently in the drive to admit women, a decision that was not reached without much disagreement and controversy. ""The politics of Barnard and the concern of the then president were that this would be seen as a public relations disaster, and that it would represent some sort of horrible aggressive act against a vulnerable sister school. It took a long time."" Rosenthal considers the subsequent change to be the greatest that has occurred since he came to Columbia. ""It was a marvelous, unambiguous good ... it made the school a happier, healthier, more interesting, more diversified, moreenergetic place."" Though the courses he teaches focus mainly on 20th century British literature — he has written a book about Virginia Woolf —Rosenthal's interests are by no means limited to literature. During his research and writing of the Woolf book, he discovered the Boy Scouts. ""It never occurred to me, as it probably never occurred to a lot of people, that the Boy Scouts actually originated in Britain. It struck some note with me.""His curiosity resulted in The Character Factory: Baden-Powell and the Origins of the Boy Scout Movement, a book which analyzes the social, moral, and political impetuses that led to the creation of the Boy Scouts. Interestingly, the Boy Scouts originated from imperial Britain's need for military manpower in the Boer War. ""The title of my book is The Character Factory. If you think of a factory as putting out uniform products, I think you immediately understand scouting has nothing to do with self-develop-ment, but the need to produce a uniform product prepared to fight and die for the empire,"" Rosenthal said. Currently, Professor Rosenthal is working on a biography of Columbia president and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Nicholas Murray Butler that he hopes to finish within two years."
293,"Marsalis, O'Meally Talk Jazz",2 February 2000,"BY BEN CASSELMAN Columbia Daily Spectator■ The trumpeter pays homage to legend Louis Armstrong at jazz seriesWynton Marsalis, the well known contemporary jazz trumpeter, paid homage to one of the legends of his instrument, Louis Armstrong, in a packed Miller Theater last night. Marsalis, along with music critic Stanley Crouch, discussed Armstrong in a conversation with Professor Robert O'Meally, the director of Columbia's new Center for Jazz Studies. The event, part of the ""Jazz and American Culture"" lecture series for the Center's inaugural year, kicked off a yearlong celebration of Armstrong and his influence on jazz. O'Meally, who said that Armstrong's name is ""synonymous with jazz music,"" founded the center last year in order to study jazz's influence on 20th century American culture. The center is the only one of its kind in America. Marsalis, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1997 for his operatic suite on slavery ""Blood on the Fields,"" and was also the recipient of an honorary degree from Columbia, is widely recognized as a leading voice of jazz today. Crouch, a critic and columnist for the Daily News, is a leading expert in the field of jazz music. Marsalis, who is known for his contributions to musical education in both the classical and jazz fields, called his conversations with Crouch ""my greatest education."" The discussion, interspersed with a variety of Armstrong's own recordings and musical demonstrations by Marsalis on both trumpet and piano, focused on how ""Pops,"" as Armstrong was known, differed from those who came before him, and how he influenced those who followed. Marsalis said that even as a boyArmstrong ""understood what all the grown men were trying to play, and he filled in all the gaps. He played the way all of those musicians wanted to play."" Marsalis did have one opportunity to show the audience his own skills. Asked by O'Meally to demonstrate how Armstrong has influ-enced his music, Marsalis joined tuba player and member of the Louis Armstrong Foundation David Oswald in a duet During the panel, Crouch compared Armstrong to familiar Literature Humanities characters Hercules, Ajax, and Achilles, calling Armstrong a ""superman"" whose physical endurance ""made the aesthetic thing possible."" ""He completely remade the sensibility of the culture,"" Crouch continued. ""Armstrong changed the nature of dreaming,"" adding that most musicians could only dream of coming close to playing as well as Armstrong played. But all three panelists emphasized that Armstrong was more than just the greatest jazz musician of his time —his music, they said, endures. Crouch said that ""one of the greatest disservices to jazz"" is the idea that musicians are only influential for a given period. Hesaid that even though recording technology has improved, Armstrong's music is still great today. Marsalis agreed. ""Our conceptions of old and new are very often market-driven,"" he said, adding that Armstrong's music ""could be now."" Marsalis and Crouch both went into great detail about what made Armstrong soimpressive. Marsalis said that Armstrong was ""constantly making the most intelligent decisions he could make."" Marsalis explained that Armstrong was a master of both harmony and rhythm. ""It sounds so natural and easy,"" Marsalis said, ""but it's not.""""There are no dead notes in his playing,"" Crouch said. ""Every note is alive."" Crouch said that with Armstrong, who was not known for playing fast, ""you have a musical experience the moment you hear [his] sound. You can't play faster than that."" Perhaps even more telling than the panelists' comments, however, were the moments of silence after some of the clips of Armstrong's playing. After listening to a 1950s recording of ""Saint James Infirmary,"" Crouch could only ask, ""What are you going to play next?"" Crouch was especially emphatic about Armstrong's importance in the future of jazz. ""We're in an extraordinarily decadent period,"" Crouch said, ""in which humanity has been tremendously degraded. Louis Armstrong will be one of the tools that will lead us back to what is important about ourselves.""Columbia Professor Robert O'Meally looks on as Pulitzer Prize-winning jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis plies his trade on the Miller Theater stage during last night's tribute to Louis Armstrong.Wynton Marsalis spoke and performed at the tribute to Louis Armstrong at Miller Theater."
294,Professors' Dual Role Leaves Depts. Short,8 February 2000,"By DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily Spectator■ Faculty leave policy important for research duties; students often kept waiting for desired courses.list has yet to be updated for the 2000-2001 academic year, though Department Chair Jack Snyder said that the information would be updated soon. Senior faculty receive one semester of leave for every four years they teach, in addition to a year-long sabbatical every seven years. Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen said thatWhen Terence Burke, CC 'OO, planned his schedule, he counted on taking a lecture taught by history professor Alan Brinkley during his sophomore year. But when Burke tried to sign up for the class, he found that Brinkley would be on leave that year. ""I was really looking forward to taking the class and worked myschedule to fit it in,"" Burke said. ""As it turned out, he was gone."" Many Columbiadepartments should know when a faculty member is going to take his or her sabbatical or scheduledstudents have had similar experiences, planning to take a course only to find the course's professor on leave. Due to various complicating factors, most departments have no formal mechanism to inform students of professors' leave years. Searching departmental Websites, one can find faculty contact information, office hours, and areas of expertise, but only political science lists the years professors plan to take leave. Even political science'sleave. ""A few years ago, we put together a spreadsheet for each department telling them when all faculty would be entitled to a leave. You can't just bank your leaves; you have to take them within a certain window,"" Cohen said. Junior faculty receive a one semester leave three years into their stay at Columbia in order to do the research they need to apply for tenure. Additionally, under the Chamberlain grant, junior faculty who teach Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization receive an extra semester worth of leave after the initial three-year period. ""In order to attract the best young faculty, they need to be able to publish,"" University Provost Jonathan Cole said. 'They need time to develop their research."" According to Cohen's estimate, up to 25 percent of faculty are on leave during any given semester due to these planned, paid leaves. Cole said that the University's leave policy is comparable to those of peer institutions. History Department Chair Martha Howell said that her department is currently revamping its Website and would consider posting planned leaves for faculty. But she added that this would be complicated because often faculty defer their leaves, so that the informationposted may not be accurate. ""Things are in flux until the end of the year. If we post this information, there would be students coming into my office pointing out that what we posted is not what in fact took place,"" she said. She added that word of mouth is effective in many cases. ""Students who need to know, know informally,"" she said. ""There is no formal mechanism to inform graduate students when professors take leave, yet they always know."" These planned leaves, however, only account for a portion of the overall leaves. 'What we really don't have control over is unpaid leaves,"" Cohen said. The most common type of unpaid leave comes in the form of grants and fellowships, which often require professors to take leave for the following year. Such awards are crucial to the University's reputation, Cole said. The leaves these grants require, however, are often difficult to compensate for, as they are often not announced until March or April of the preceding academic year. ""From time to time, this causes difficulties in covering the curriculum,"" Snyder said. ""It's particularly a problem in American politics, where there's a high undergraduate demand and also where the faculty receives many awards."" Cohen said that, although the Administration asks that faculty defer grants when the leave time involved would be disruptive to the curriculum, gaining these deferments is often difficult. ""There is a long tradition here that when a faculty member, for instance, wins a Guggenheim they are never told that they can't take leave,"" Cohen said. ""Columbia loves old traditions."" 'We had a bad situation this year with a very distinguished award, which we tried to push back because the department had enormous scheduling problems. The foundation called us and said, Weare going to take it away if the faculty member cannot exercise it this year, and we will take Columbia off our list.' We had to fold on that one,"" Cohen said. Faculty members applying for grants for the following year submit a leave request to their department chairs early in the fall semester. Cole said that difficulties arise when leaves occur in clusters, noting that several years ago four Americanists from the History Department took leave at once, leaving a gap in that part of the curriculum. ""It's a juggling act,"" Howell said. ""There's a ripple effect. Say a women's studies course is being taught by a professor who takes leave. If you replace this professor with another professor whose specialty is women's studies and Asian studies, you now have a gap in Asian studies. It's a mess."" The History Department's area committees —divided geographically—monitor the teaching status of courses within their areas. These committees then report to the curriculum committee, which oversees the program of the entire department. Howell and Snyder both said that an important part of coping with faculty leaves was distinguishing between essential and nonessential courses. ""Coverage really depends on the course being offered. There are some courses, introductory courses for example, that we need to offer every year; while there are other courses, enrichment courses, that are nice to have but that we don't have to offer every year,"" Snyder said. Departments are able to find some help through the hiring of adjunct faculty. ""With unpaid leave, you get salary savings, which allows you to hire adjuncts,"" Cohen said. Even with adjuncts and other measures, the University still finds itself walking a tightrope between its curricular and research needs. ""It's the kind of thing that makes administrators' hair go gray,"" Cole said."
295,Colloquium Program Poised for Comeback,14 February 2000,"By DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily Spectator■ A new proposal for next year's class is in place to offer one colloquium per semester to seniors.Absent from course offerings this year for the first time since its 1932 inception, Columbia College's Colloquium Program looks poised to make at least a partial comeback, with a proposal in the works for one colloquium per semester for the 2000-2001 academic year. The Colloquium Program—originally the Colloquium on Important Books —began as a precursor to Literature Humanities and since the inception of „Literature Humanities in 1937 has served as anextension of the Core, consisting of interdisciplinary seminars on major texts. Each colloquium was teamtaught by two senior professors from two different departments. Colloquia professors over the years included such famed Columbia faculty as Arthur Collins, Edward Said, Lionel Trilling, and Mark Van Doren. At the program's height, two colloquia—a specific cross-discipli-nary program distinct from departmental courses with ""colloquium"" in their titles, such as Colloquium on Major Asian Texts —were taught per semester and were open to juniors and seniors by application. Enrollment for all colloquia capped at 15. The new proposal, which has yet to gain approval from the Colloquium Steering Committee or the College's Committee on Instruction (COI), would offer one colloquium per semester, open only to seniors. But not everyone finds the Colloquium's long history impressive.""Just because we did something in the past is not necessarily an argument for doing it in the present or the future,"" Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen said. Kathryn Yatrakis, dean of academic affairs and secretary of COI, said that reinstating the colloquia required reconciling a number of issues, but still feels it would be a major boon for the College. ""We need to balance teaching resources and the ability to teach these courses,"" shesaid. Members of the steering committee0 said that while they would like to see at least two colloquia per semester in the future, one colloquium was a vast improvement over none. ""Let's get it to the point where we can offer two first-rate colloquia each year and then assess where we can go with it,"" Political Science Professor Ira Katznelson, CC '66, said In recent years, the program has been criticized as an inefficient utilization of teaching resources because two senior faculty members teach one 15-person course. ""Students in, say, history or political science may feel deprived of senior faculty if the professor is teaching a colloquium instead of a senior seminar [within the department] ,"" said Paul Anderer, a professor in the East Asian Languages and Cultures department. Committee members, however, feel the problem can be avoided. Katznelson said that faculty resources would not be drained by a modest-sized colloquium program. There is also debate as to how faculty should be compensated for teaching colloquia and team-taught courses in general. Cohen, whose office oversees all financial decisions made by the College on academic matters, said that faculty should only be given full instructional credit for team-taught cours-es in certain cases, while Colloquium Committee Chair and English Professor James Shapiro, CC '77, said faculty should receive full credit in all cases. ""Anyone who's ever team-taught a course will tell you that it's more work [than teaching a course alone],"" Shapiro said. ""You have to dovetail your teaching style with that of another professor, and you have to master material in which you're not an expert."" Cohen said that team-taught courses are ""popping up in different niches. It's just a matter of how you plan to fund it."" Because the Colloquium Program does not fall under any department, there is no standard budgetary allocation for it. Anderer said that he hoped Arts and Sciences would give departments extra funds in order to hire additional faculty or take other measures to compensate for losing senior faculty members to the colloquium. ""In the old days, teaching a colloquium was something that professors just did, with no extra dollars involved. In this era, everything's a la carte,"" Cohen said, adding that ""this is traditionally something that would be funded out of the College,"" which has its own budget overseen by Cohen. Shapiro disagreed, however. ""When we first approached [Cohen], he felt faculty should teach these courses on overload. There are few faculty who are not already overworked, and this is too much to ask,"" he said. Members of the colloquium committee said there are importantreasons to maintain a series of colloquia. ""Seniors leaving the College should have the opportunity to work at close quarters with senior faculty. It's a significant kind of adventure; we're all in deep water with these texts, none of the professors are going to be experts in all of them,"" Anderer said. Katznelson added that ""the existence of this small, but potentially very important part of the curricu-"
296,Keeping the Romance Alive Professors Find Love Amid Academic Demands,14 February 2000,"Professors Find Love Amid Academic DemandsBy CELINE GOETZ Columbia Daily SpectatorAlongside the links to his CV, various papers, and research results, Economics professor Matthew Kahn's Webpage concludes with another proud statement, ""Everyone knows that economists are romantics at heart. Professor Costa and I were married on May 29, 1998."" Professor Kahn is not the only Columbia professor with a romantic side. In the midst of academia, with its reputation of tough competition for tenure, grants, and publication, top professors find love —often with each other. In fact, the marriage of Professor Kahn and his wife, Professor Dora Costra of the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, has been a subject of research for the two. Together, they published a paper on the rise of dual career households, or ""power couples,"" a phenomenon experienced by the couple first hand. According to Professor Kahn, the couple found that, ""the co-location problem of 'power couples' increases their demand for living in big cities."" Thus, Columbia's location is a recruiting tool for professors from Dartmouth, Yale, or Cornell (holding salaries constant) because New York City gives a career-minded spouse a lot of freedom. Along the lines of Kahn's research, Professors Carol Sanger and Jeremy Watson were both able to find positions beneficial to their respective careers at the Columbia Law School. ""We were about as blessed as one [couple] can be,"" said Professor Watson. ""When the opportunity to move to Columbia came, it was a good move for both of us."" The couple met at the University of California-Berkeley in 1989, at which point both professors had already established careers in their field. ""I just met her in the coffee shop one day,"" Professor Watson reminisced. The two professors have different backgrounds—Professor Watson is from New Zealand and trained at Oxford, whereas Professor Sanger is American and trained at Wellesley College and the University of Michigan. Their interests compliment each other, though. Professor Watson specializes in the philosophy behind law, while Professor Sanger focuses on family law and contract law. ""For her, it's a new experience getting into the more philosophical argumentation. For me, it's getting used to policy theory and also literary theory,""Professor Watson said. Unlike Professors Watson and Sanger, Professors Dawn and Andrew Delbanco also met when they were quite young. Now married for 26 years, the couple ""met as undergraduates at Harvard, went through graduate school together, and began teaching at about the sametime in the same place,"" the Delbancos said. Like Watson and Sanger, they feel fortunate to be together teaching on the Morningside Heights campus. ""Though it is not a novelty for us to be in the same academic institution, we feel very lucky to be at Columbia today,"" the couple added. While the specialties of the Delbancos differ—Dawn Delbanco teaches Art Humanities and Asian Art Humanities, while Andrew Delbanco teaches Literature Humanities and courses in American literature — ""there does seem to be some traffic between our courses,"" they commented. In other words, students will take the courses of both professors. Luckily, ""so far, no student has placed any stress on our marriage by praising one of us excessively to the other,"" said the Delbancos. Like the Delbancos, prominent Economics Professors Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai met in Cambridge, Massachusetts and havebeen together for a considerable amount of time. Both from the West Coast of India, the two met in 1957 and have spent almost four decades together. Like Kahn and Costa, the couple has conducted research together. Before they were married, the two professors wrote a book entitled India Planning for Industrialization. Together, they argued that India needed to open up to the world economy in order to reduce the country's poverty. Writing the book ""deepened our relationship,"" Bhagwati said. ""We saw eye to eye on that [issue]... How can you see so much poverty and not want to do something about it? But we didn't just want to state sediments and slogans; we wanted to examine what India was doing about it [in thebook]."" Desai also felt that the joint writing of that book was an influential force on her life. ""That [experience] made me think, should I be doing professional work in the area that is also my husband's professional area?"" Desai said. ""Because we were both working then in economic development, I decided to switch to [specializing in] the Soviet Union."" Desai emphasized the need to maintain a professional identity when married to an equally prominent professional in the same field. ""The search for professional identity should be important for every person, but especially for women,"" Desai said. ""And when you are married to someone who not only works in the same field, but also the same department, ... it's very important to have separate identities."" Accordingly, she has kept her maiden name, as a sign of her professional identity. Ultimately, one of the main bonds Bhagwati and Desai share is a willingness ""to take on positions where we are alone some of the time,"" Bhagwati said. Both experts in their field, Desai and Bhagwati have stood up and supported arguments that have not always been popular. For example, Desai said she would not support the ""shock therapy"" approach to revitalizing the Russian economy after the fall of the Soviet Union. Although few other specialists in the field shared her view, she believed that reforms must be gradual. Bhagwati supported his wife's position in this matter; to this day, he recounts her debates on McNeal/Lehrer News Hour. Desai shares this admiration for her spouse. ""There is no one whom I admire more [than my husband],"" said Desai. ""He enters the room and the sun comes out.""In the midst of academia, with its reputation of tough competition for tenure, grants, and publication, top professors find love—often with each other.When you are married to someone who ... works in the same department ... it's very important to have separate identities.' —Padma Desai"
297,Staff Editorial Bring Back Colloquia,14 February 2000,"Bring Back ColloquiaThe Committee on Colloquia recently recommended that only one colloquium be offered throughout Columbia College starting next semester. If the Committee on Instruction (COI) carries out this recommendation, it will deprive College students of personal attention from professors who are already coping with dwindling resources to teach increasing numbers of students. By drastically limiting colloquia, which are like seminars except in that they are taught by two professors of different departments, the University is demonstrating it is not truly dedicated to increasing the number of senior faculty. While devoting one or more professors to a small class may put a financial strain on the University budget and instructional demand, allowing students to interact in a small group of peers and professors is academically rewarding and necessary for the College experience. Learning begins with the exchange of ideas, and even in a small lecture course interaction between students and professors is severely limited, if not non-exis-tent. Colloquia, which allow two professors to lead class discussion, further enhance the learning experience that one would receive in a lecture or even in a seminar. While College students have Literature Humanities andContemporary Civilization as colloqui-um-like courses, these courses are generally offered only in the first two years, thereby leaving upperclassmen who want to continue with a colloquia experience out in the cold. Although it could be said that juniors and seniors have the option and are often required to take seminars, the fact that seminars have coexisted alongside colloquia for so long signifies that colloquia offer something that seminars cannot. Additionally, offering only one colloquium a semester would be unfair to those students who would not have enrolled in that colloquium in time. At least if a particular lecture or seminar course is full, a student has numerous other alternatives that semester, sometimes within the same academic department. By only teaching one colloquium per semester, at best 40-50 students will enjoy its benefits, while the College's many other students will have to wait for at least another semester. If the University is to offer only one colloquium per semester, it will be dodging a fundamental question that the administration needs to answer: do they place value in ensuring the intimate academic experience of its students? Columbia students deserve such attention."

The balance of the two buildings will house upper class students. ■ All students, including first-years, will have to apply to live there, under the new Living and Learning Center plan for the twin buildings. ■ First-years will be spread throughout the doubles in both buildings and in some singles.■ Restructuring of South Field dorms met with harsh student oppositionOne day after the University announced two very significant changes to the housing policies for the 2000-2001 academic year, the smoke is far from clearing. Expressing feelings of shock and resentment, students are questioning the motivations behind the changes to the lottery and the extent to which the Administration will respond to feedback. Beginning next year, HartleyWallach will be converted to a ""Living and Learning Center"" (LLC). Incoming first-years, who will comprise approximately 60 percent of the building, will share 11 to 16-person suites with rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors. All students, including rising first-years, will need to apply to live in the LLC; Hartley and Wallach will not be included in this year's lottery. The change spurring the most controversy, particularly from thejunior class, is that Furnald will be unavailable to rising seniors. According to e-mails sent by the administrators involved in the process, Furnald will be made available solely to sophomores and juniors in this year's lottery. Additionally, there will be approximately 45 more beds available on the second floor of Mcßain, River will be closed down for renovations, and second year 3-2 Engineering students will be able to participate in the lottery. Students, including those on the Columbia College Student Council are most upset about what they call a complete lack of student input in the decision. ""They have made these changes based on [residence] hall surveys they have collected over the last few years, but did not converse or consult with current students, RAs, or members of student government,"" said CC 'Ol President Seth Morris. Morris added that he and his classmates were so disturbed by the news that, ""We're considering organizing a boycott on the lottery altogether. This is something that the campus will really rally behind—people feel that strongly about it."" Undergraduate House Council Policy Vice-President David Newman, CC 'Ol, said that the House Council was not involved in the decision-making process. ""Regardless of the decision, students should have been part of the process actively, not passively,"" he said. ""We should have been consulted. The Administration dropped the ball on communication.""Daniel Wetmore, CC 'Ol, concurred, saying that the lack of communication on the decision to change the housing policies is evidence of a larger problem. ""There is a faceless administration trying to implement policies to enhance this sense of community without consulting the student body,"" he said. ""They are sitting in their ivory tower in Low. It's not so much the housing situation; rather, it is their whole approach.""Morris sent an e-mail out at 10 a.m. and by three p.m., he said he had received 91 responses from juniors expressing their concerns. 'This is a big mistake on [the] part of the administration and students will not stand for it,"" he said. ""We feel the principle of limiting choice must be justified by an overwhelm-ingly-strong need that has simply not been demonstrated by the Administration."" Dean of Student Affairs Chris Colombo and Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Brian Paquette were both unavailable for comment. Speaking about the LLC, Associate Dean of Residential and Advising Programs Sandra Johnson said that ""it will be a more intense living experience."" She said that faculty and distinguished alumni will speak throughout the year, and that students would be largely responsible for designing and implementing their own programming.Director of University Residence Halls Ross Fraser refused to comment. An e-mail signed by Fraser and Johnson described the motivation behind the LLC. They describe the Center as ""the fruit of our efforts to broaden and enhance the opportunities we provide our continually evolving learning community."" [See graphic] The first-years and sophomores living in Hartley-Wallach will take their Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses with each other in 109 Hartley, a classroom built specifically to host Core courses. Rachel Knapp CC 'Ol, questioned how popular the program was going to be. ""I think the LLC is going to be a complete bomb,"" she said. ""People are going to do things with their own friends."" Administrators said they felt that it would be unfair to allow rising seniors access to both the Broadway Dorm and to Furnald, two of the newest dorms on campus. Although they said they considered filling both Hartley and Wallach entirely with first-years, they felt that decision would prompt a greater backlash from upperclassmen wanting to live in suites than the current changes would. CCSC Representative-at-Large Vasantha Rao, CC 'Ol, who has been polling first-years living in HartleyWallach, said that the participants in the two-year-old program are upset because they are ""confined to 12 students in their suite.""

299,"Core Awards Honor Art, Music Hum",18 February 2000,"BY DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily SpectatorDuring his junior year, Maurice Toueg, CC '96, was behind in taking classes in his economics major and working late nights at the Spectator. He certainly didn't think that he had time to take a class on Mozart, especially not one that met at 9 a.m. But Professor Elaine Sisman, his former Music Humanities instructor, was teaching the course, and he never missed a class all semester. Sisman, along with Professor of Art David Rosand, was honored last night at the 7th Annual Core Awards for commitment to the Core Curriculum, which speakers said encourages breadth of vision. In his opening remarks, John Mitchell Mason Professor Emeritus William Theodore de Bary distinguished between other forms ofteaching and teaching the Core, which he said required professors to draw students out in a classroom setting. ""Everyone wants to get in on the act of recognizing great teachers,"" he said. ""But there's a difference between getting in front of students and performing and the type of experience the Core provides, where the whole learning group must perform for themselves."" Professor of Art Jonathan Crary said in his introduction that Rosand was intent on keeping the Core Curriculum focused on refining methods of intellectual inquiry rather than on learning specific facts. ""Whenever we interview graduate students applying to be precep-tors for Art Humanities, and we ask them how they would teach, say, the Parthenon, the graduate students always say that they would give their students an overview of the history of Greek sculpture or something,"" Crary said. ""Rosand always says, 'no, that's precisely what you're not going to do.' He understands that that's not what it's about."" Dean Austin Quigley agreed with this sentiment, saying that without the Core, it would be too easy to ""gain depth of knowledge at the expense of breadth of vision."" He added that undergraduate education excessively focused on major-specific instruction allows students to ""learn more and more about less and less."" Rosand said that his experiences teaching Art Humanities were among the best of his career. 'The previous speakers have said that my commitment to the Core is selfless. I consider it the most selfish —in terms of self-fulfill-ing—thing I've done,"" he said. Crary said that it was his experience as a Columbia undergraduate in Rosand's Art Hum section that convinced him to be an Art History major and to go on to become a professor. Sisman defended the Core against charges that it is too timeconsuming. ""From time to time, people suggest that students only be required to take either Art Hum or Music Hum. When I hear people say that, I always think, would you rather cutout your eyes or cut off your ears?'"" Sisman said. In his remarks, de Bary stressed the importance of the Core in an era when college courses are being offered over the Internet. ""It is unlikely that something called 'distance learning' can match the attention given to students by the Core,"" he said. But new technology also gained a favorable mention last night, due to Rosand's attempts to integrate new media into Art Hum instruction. Rosand recently completed the Raphael Project, which uses electronic media to analyze one of Raphael's frescoes and which is now being used by Art Hum staff. ""[Rosand] continues to provide colleagues and preceptors with a powerful sense of the original vision of the Art Humanities program while actively leading efforts to modernize the program for the 21st Century,"" said the event's program notes. Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen said that while he did not take the Core himself because he did not attend Columbia as an undergraduate, he was impressed by the effect that it has had on Columbia graduates. He cited as an example David Denby, CC '65, a film critic who came back to Columbia several years ago to write a book on the Core. ""Most of the time when you have a midlife crisis, you go out and buy a Porsche. If you're a Columbia alum and you have a midlife crisis, you retake Literature Humanities,"" Cohen joked.Art Professor David Rosand is presented with his award."
300,WEEK IN REVIEW,18 February 2000,"University Alters Housing Policy To Student Disapproval One day after the University announced two very significant changes to the housing policies for the 2000-2001 academic year, the smoke is far from clearing.

Despite Large Gifts, Alumni Giving Rates Remain Weak As Columbia continues its quest for eminence, it finds itself struggling to mobilize support from an often indifferent alumni corps. While Columbia brings in significant contributions from a small group of wealthy alumni, the overall percentage of alumni who contribute to Columbia currently stands at 31 percent, the lowest in the Ivy League. University officials attribute the low giving rate to several historical factors: Columbia's history as a commuter school, the 1968 riots and their legacy of studentAdministration animosity, and a lack of connection between the University and students. ""You felt somewhat marginalized,"" University Provost Jonathan Cole said of past Columbia classes. ""You didn't feel like you were part of a community. And I think, therefore, there are a lot of people who aren't as deeply committed to Columbia."" That lack of commitment then is hurting Columbia now. Alumni giving makes up a small but vital factor in how U.S. News and World Report calculates its college rankings in which Columbia ranks 24th in the nation.New Sexual Misconduct Proposal Released The Senate Task Force on Sexual Misconduct released its final proposal for revising the Sexual Misconduct Policy Tuesday, but student activists are still not satisfied. Task Force members claimed the new resolutions accepted most student demands, but representatives from Students Active for Ending Rape (SAFER) said that the new version fails to make necessary changes, while at the same time it includes unexpected changes to clauses of which the student group originally approved. While the new proposal eliminated the students' main bone of contention, a provision that allowed deans of students to see the process's verdict before it was finalized, student activists had new criticisms, complaining that the document does not call for the policy to be reviewed in the future, include any reference to a statute of limitations, or call for student involvement in a proposed oversight subcommittee. Colloquium Program Poised for Comeback Absent from course offerings this year for the first time since its 1932 inception, Columbia College's Colloquium Program will likely be reinstated next year.A new proposal which has yet to gain approval from the Colloquium Steering Committee of the College's Committee on Instruction would offer one colloquium per semester next year, open only to seniors. The Colloquium Program began as a precursor to Literature Humanities and since that course's inception in 1937 has served as an extension of the Core. A colloquium is an interdisciplinary seminar on major texts that is team-taught by two senior professors from two different departments English Department Weighs Major's Viability As the fourth most popular undergraduate major and one that has changed its requirements multiple times in the last decade, the English department is striving for continuity and searching for a more stable curriculum. The current model, instituted this fall, abandoned the historical and chronological emphasis of the previous system and is anchored by the reinstitution of the Introduction to the Major course five years ago, but it is still considered a work in progress by many professors and students. Critics of the most recent changes find the new major unfocused and in need of immediate repair. ""English majors are best served when they are treated to aFor the week of , 4 , Feb. 14 greater depth and breadth of material,"" said Professor Kathy Eden, who was in the minority of faculty members who voted against the current curriculum. ""The new major goes too far in accommodating the faculty, and it is far from an ideal system."" Senate Struggles With Apathy and Low Turnout The University Senate passed its new anti-sweatshop code of conduct without objection last month, but only half of the Senators voted for it. That's because only half of them showed up. In fact, the average Senate attendance since September is only 49 percent. Even at November's meeting, where more than 150 students came to watch the Senate debate the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy, only 40 of 79 Senators showed up. The absence rate is especially high among tenured professors, but the trend crosses all Senate divisions. Administrators, staff members, and students —especially graduate students —have missed meetings on a regular basis over the past two years. ""I consider it not only very sad, but even disgraceful,"" said Senator and Professor Luciano Rebay."
301,Cross Examines Evolution Of Core Curriculum at CU,22 March 2000,"By DAVID GERRARD Columbia Daily SpectatorAs Contemporary Civilization (CC) enters its 80th year, the history of the Core Curriculum has been filled with constant questioning of its purpose and content, historian and author of a book on the Core Timothy Cross said last night at the Faculty House. Cross opened the seminar by explaining that he thought the title of his book, An Oasis of Order, which was decided on by the members of the Trustee committee that commissioned him to write it, was misleading. ""There's order insofar as there's been a set curriculum for 43 years, since the introduction of Art and Music Humanities. But the real story has been one of rethinking,"" Cross said. The Core now must readjust to the University's Enlargement and Enhancement program, which has created a strain on Core faculty, according to Cross. ""There was a time when all thehumanities instructors could sit around a single table,"" Cross said, pointing out that the number of Literature Humanities sections in any given semester has risen from 20 to well over 50 since its 1937 inception. But Cross said that the Core was never as stable as some assume. CC, the flagship of Columbia College's commitment to general education, came about in 1919 partially as a reaction to the College's movement towards pre-professional education at the turn of the 20th century. Cross said that CC's rise to prominence was not without bumps in the road. CC was originally divided into two courses: CC-A the equivalent of what the CC students know today, and CC-B, which focused on current political and economic problems. CC-B was never popular, and, after the increasing specialization of the social sciences in the 19505, was terminated. CC was followed by the Colloquium on Important Books, a survey of great Western literature,in 1932. The colloquium was open to juniors and seniors only by application. This process came under criticism for its elitism, and the colloquium was transformed in 1937 to Humanities A, later called Literature Humanities, which was open to, and eventually required of, all entering students. Cross said that the Core came to a crossroads in 1970, in the midst of the University turmoil of the late 19605. A committee headed by Professor of Slavic Languages Robert Belknap suggested replacing it with distribution requirements. The Administration did not,however, adopt this policy. Cross said he was pleased with his book's subtitle, The Core Curriculum and its Discontents, because it captures the contentious nature of the Core and because it referenced Freud's Civilization and its Discontents, one of the most popular CC texts.There was a time when all the humanities instructors could sit around a single table.' —Timothy Cross, historian and author"
302,English Major Requirements Should Be More Focused,6 April 2000,"THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED BY BRIAN WEBSTERAs one who just declared English as my major, I've been looking over the major requirements, courses offered, and the general approach to undergraduate learning the English department takes through the undergraduate major. While the English major plays host to a myriad of interesting courses and a number of amazing professors, its endless distribution categories and requirements allow students to attain only a survey perspective on literature. While the major encourages students to combine these survey perspectives into an interdisciplinary body of knowledge, the major requirements work against achieving this goal. The muddled nature of the English major begins with its Introduction to the Major course, designed to teach students how to approach and analyze literary works. In shaping this course, the department cannot agree upon a unified canon of books and therefore has not fostered the collective intellectual community that should exist amongst students in a major. For example, all political science majors will not agree on whether countries are inherently prone towards cooperation or towards self-interest. But in making such a determination, they all will look at the government of a country, the country's political culture, andother common factors. While in teaching a methodology, a major may exclude some the-ories or works, teaching a common methodology provides students with a common point of discussion even outside the classroom.What the Introduction to the Major course should model itself after —and what it should be replaced by—is Literature Humanities. Because the purpose of Literature Humanities is to teach students how to approach and analyze literary works, it having a common canon of books is valuable because it ensures that all first-years come out of Literature Humanities using a common approach to literature. This is not to say that all first-years hold or should hold this common canon as sacred. A common canon simply allows students to engage in discourse starting from a mutually agreed-upon point. This common point of discourse is absolutely and intellectually essential. Yet, even if Literature Humanities replaced Introduction to the Major, the English major still lacks a logical progression between the first and last course a student would take within the major. The purpose of any major should be to instruct students on how to approach that body of knowledge andthen allow students to later hone in on a specific area of inquiry. In English, though, stu-dents take a British literature course, a pre-16^ 1 century literature course, - t •»and a drama course, and are expected to somehow mesh it all into an interdisciplinary conclusion about English. But if a class on Shakespeare fits into the pre-1800, drama, and British geographical requirements so that a student should have some notion of early British drama, then the department should teach a course in early British drama. The department cannot stand by and hope three related courses will impart to students core knowledge of British drama. With 11 distribution requirements that allow for a course to fulfill more than one requirement at a time, the English major provides students only with a surface knowledge of literature. Admittedly, the department teaches seminars that theoretically relate to the more introductory courses, and yes, I'm sure there are plenty of majors who can make the connection between related courses. But since many students will be academically exposed to English for the last time at Columbia, the major should give its students the best chance to attain a coherent knowledge of English through providing someguidance. The department advisors should be helping students figure out where to go with their major, not the major itself. These guidelines need not be that specific—in Major Cultures, a system exists where each area of inquiry has A, B, and C courses, and a student must take an A course before taking a B or C course. Why can't the English major have something similar? Just because literature is a broad subject, the department should not shy away from drawing lines and making judgements about the content of courses. A major is not a complete body of knowledge. Rather, it is the common set of intellectual tools a department determines that students need to successfully explore their area of interest. Certain literary works and authors undoubtedly will be left out in the process of selecting a common curriculum. But without a common curriculum, the intellectual community that is supposed to foster learning even after class is done will not exist. Aid without a set of major requirements that tell us where to go on our English intellectual journey, English majors will unknowingly leave Columbia as confused as they were when they got here.Brian Webster is a Columbia Colleg sophomore majoring in English."
303,"Core Examined, Defended",13 April 2000,"BY DAVID SOLOWAY Columbia Daily Spectator■ SPEaK sponsors event on Core, bringing students, teachers together.A triumvirate of senior professors discussed the merits and drawbacks of the Core, with one senior professor suggesting that the Core be completely reworked, and two others saying that the Core was strong despite bumps in the road. The 90-minute event was hosted by Students Promoting Empowerment and Knowledge (SPEaK) in order to foster discussion on the legitimacy of the Core. The event featured the following professors, all University titans: Robert Hanning, a 37-year veteran of the Department of English and Comparative Literature, who will teach a section of the Core next year; Theodore de Bary, a creator and founder of Asian Humanities and a member of the Columbia community since 1937; and Jim Zetzel, a professor in the Classics Department and the director of Contemporary Civilization (CC). The debate was an attempt to allow students to interact with faculty who were not only wellinformed about the Core, but willing and able to alter the curriculum to meet student needs, according to University Senator Sofia Berger, CC 'Ol, who served as the modera-tor of the forum. ""There are always people who want to debate the advantages and disadvantages of the Core,"" Berger said. ""And this was an opportunity for students and faculty to examine an important part of their Columbia education."" SPEaK Coordinator Steven Francisco explained the reasoning behind the group's decision to host last night's event. ""It's forums like this that allow us to debate whether or not the West was truly developed by a group of dead white men, or whether the picture was much more complex than that. The fact that somuch of Contemporary Civilization no longer deals with contemporary civilizations speaks to the need for more discussions such as this one."" ""Curricular issues are always of importance to faculty, or should be, and since the Core Curriculum directly affects all College students, and thus indirectly all those who teach them, faculty should certainly be willing to join in serious discussions about such matters,""Francisco said. He added that he felt it important to ""recognize that the core is not static; it has been and continues to be subject to reform and redesign."" ""It is also of grave importance to critically discuss whether or not a Western canon is a social construct or an actual representation of the development of knowledge,"" Francisco said. The forum opened with a presentation from Patrick Jackson, a political science graduate student and current CC instructor. Jackson traced the evolution of the Core from its nascent stages in 1917,where it was offered in collaboration with the Department of War to teach students ""why it was important to fight and die for their country,"" to its dramatic shift in ideology as a result of the riots of 1968. ""The Core is not something that can be defined,"" Jackson said. ""It is constantly changing, constantly evolving."" He added that the purpose of CC is ""per-haps to debate what the purpose of CC really is."" Following Jackson's introduction, Hanning spoke about the shortcomings of the Core and questioned its function in the University. In addition to the numerous resources that each department must commit to teach the Core annually, Hanning has reservations about both the content and marketing of the Core.""I am not fundamentally opposed to college-wide degree requirements,"" said Hanning, who has not taught in the Core for more than 25 years. ""And I realize the advantages of a unifying education for each student in the College. But the Core is not the answer, at least not in its current form."" Hanning cited the problems with Literature Humanities (Lit Hum) and CC, but added that he would ""fight hard"" to preserve both Art and Music Humanities, as he feels they are an imperative part of an undergraduate's education. Zetzel defended the CC curriculum: ""It is a constant battle every time we revise the syllabus. The course is a constant race, as we are always trying to keep up."" De Bary, the John Mitchell Mason Professor of the University and Provost Emeritus. He urged the audience to regard the Core as a constant work in progress, due to the fact that new texts, and even new courses, are always being added. ""The Core is never complete,"" said de Bary, who credited Harry Carman, his first Columbia professor and future Dean of the College, as one of the primary influences on his future career in academics. ""The Core is more a process, not a specific body of material."" De Bary's efforts at Columbia College have led to the addition of a two-semester Major Cultures requirement for all undergraduates, as he attempted to confront perennial issues of human society outside of Europe and America. ""There is no such thing as Asian Civilization singular,"" de Bary said. ""There are many distinct and unique cultures, and from thatgroup you have to choose those that have been most influential throughout the course of history."" De Bary believes the purpose of the Core is to show students how much knowledge is available to them if they search for it. ""You are given a small taste of certain landmarks of European tradition, and to a lesser extent that of Asian tradition,"" he said. ""And after that, one would hope that you have the desire to go on and learn more than you ever imagined."" Contemporary Civilization and Lit Hum, according to de Bary, are courses that are limited by time but that still strive to teach students ""to express themselves and better communicate their thoughts and ideas."" Echoing de Bary's optimism about both the Core and its future, Zetzel also stressed that the Core was far from immutable. ""There is an institutional belief that there should be common content for all Columbia students,"" said Zetzel, who has been at the University for the last 15 years. ""And there is also a belief that as Columbia students and faculty change, so should the Core."" He said that the CC and Lit Hum syllabi are always under revision,, with new texts chosen every two years. ""Everyone finds at least a small part of the Core unsatisfactory,"" Zetzel said. ""There are some texts that I teach in CC that I feel do not belong. But the value of a common curriculum outweighs the disadvantages."" Zetzel also feels that the Core is valuable for the professors who teach it. ""We are forced to interact and discuss the texts with students who"
304,Students Object to Plan for Earlier Drop Date,10 May 2000,"By DAVID SOLOWAY Columbia Daily SpectatorStudents were always presented with an attractive solution to the tough midterm, the boring or difficult to understand professor, or their decision to sleep through half of their classes: simply drop the class up to 11 weeks into the semester and all would be forgotten. But for the future classes of Columbia College, beginning with the Class of 2004, there will be no such luxury. Despite student appeals, the Committee on Instruction (COI) decided before Spring Break to move the drop date up six weeks, to the fifth week of each semester, leaving the pass/fail gradingoption at the 11-week mark The former system did not apply to Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and a few other classes. Students may not drop any course after the new date without approval from the Committee on Academic Standing, approval that Dean of Academic Affairs and Secretary of COl Kathryn Yatrakis said would be rare. Yatrakis said she has advocated moving up the drop date since she assumed her post over adecade ago. She added that many administrators and faculty members have long felt Columbia College's drop policy is too lenient and that the change was prompted by the Morningside Classroom Committee, which consisted of faculty and administrators who were responsible forstudying ways the University could improve classroom conditions. The report from the Committee that prompted COl's recommendation stated that the College's original drop date ""has a detrimental effect on both instruction and room utilization."" The report also said that the drop date, which in its current state occurs later than at most other prestigious universities, encourages students to sign up for classes they have no serious intention of completing. As a result, the report stated that other students who might wish to take the class are closed out byshould have the same opportunities,"" Kammerman said. There is also a proposal still under discussion that would enable students in the Class of 2004 and beyond to take up to three courses per year for pass/fail, as opposed to the current cap of one per semester.possible class-size limits. ""In courses that are at maximum enrollments, each drop represents a potential student denied admission,"" the report stated. But others, including Columbia College Student Council (CCSC) President Seth Kammerman, CC 'OO, were not so pleased with the changes. ""We've had great opportunities to explore classes because of the drop policy, and we think classes which come after usAdoption of the new policy followed weeks of student criticism of proposed changes to COl's original recommendation, which would have resulted in future Columbia College students receiving a 'W' on their transcripts if they dropped a class after a four-week shopping period. A grade of 'W' would have had no effect on a student's grade point average. CCSC President-elect Ariel Neuman, CC 'Ol, questioned the report's finding that students take classes without intending to finish. ""Most people we talked to said they did not intend to drop the classes they dropped,"" Neuman said. The report added that the presence of the drop date is a self-fulfilling prophecy, discouraging students from working at full capacity in a course because they know they can drop it if they perform poorly. Students who register for classes without plans to complete them can cause inefficient classroom assignments and a wasteful use of Teaching Assistants (TAs). Neuman, who spent his junior year as CCSC communications representative and is a Spectator columnist, said that the CCSC committee (which he headed) designed to examine the report disagreed with the link between crowded classrooms and the drop date. His committee concluded that most classrooms were not especially crowded after the first two weeks of the semester.According to the Classroom Committee, 10 percent of students who register for a lecture or seminar course will drop it, excluding those who drop a class during the ""program adjustment period"" of the first two weeks of the semester. The committee also said that 50 percent of drops occur in weeks 10 and 11, and that 65 percent of total drops occur after a course's midterm, traditionally given around week seven. According to the Committee, this is so because there is no incentive for students - J to file drops early.iilV Ui VJ-/VJ VUI IJ • Yatrakis said the earlier drop date would encourage students to give more thought to the classes for which they register and therefore limit the need to drop a class following the midterm. Neuman, however, said that the purpose of the current drop date is to provide a safety net for"
305,Anca Cornis-Pop,17 May 2000,"BY MAX J. DICKSTEIN Columbia Daily SpectatorIt is an indisputable fact: Anca Cornis-Pop, CC 'OO had a great time during her four years at Columbia. It may be the curse of salutatorians to be reputed as antisocial overachievers, but while Cornis-Pop may be a lot of things, she is certainly not that. She has been an active Columbian while maintaining a rather astounding academic pace. Cornis-Pop is the daughter of two Romanian-born professionals —her father is a professor of modern-English literature and her mother is a speech pathologist (Anca's sister Oana just finished her first year at Columbia). Infifth-grade, encouraged by her parents, who told her she was ""good at arguing,"" Cornis-Pop declared that she would attend law school. After becoming valedictorian of her high school class in Richmond, Virginia, and now second-place academically at Columbia with a 4.063 GPA (the extra-4.0 status is made possible by A-pluses, which are worth 4.33 points at Columbia), Cornis-Pop is ready for Harvard Law School in the fall. But Cornis-Pop had time for things other than acade-mics at Columbia —she played violin for the orchestra and coordinated for a group that helped homeless New Yorkers. And if you went out to dinner with Cornis-Pop this year, it was probably at the Fish Restaurant on 109 th and Broadway ""I just tried it at the beginning of this year—it's really good,"" said the political science major. As for Cornis-Pop's towering GPA, enjoyable classes made her achievement easier—particularly the Core Cirriculum, which she may love even more than David Denby. According to her, Columbia should be ranked No. 1 in the nation academically because of that sequence of courses required of all undergraduates. ""I don't care if it sounds like I'm kissing up. I'm the posterchild for the Core,""Cornis-Pop said. After all, Cornis-Pop has the Core predisposition. She was wont to load up on courses in political science and literature (her concentration was inFrench), areas that correspond with the basic core courses: Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities. And she took some memorable courses, particularly the seminar she took with George Stephanopoulos last year. It was a 16-student course on the American presidency split evenly between graduates and undergraduates. The application for admission to the former Clinton advisor's class required a resume and essay.Cornis-Pop was delighted by the seminar, especially its reliance on discussion and round-robin reports by students, each on a different president. ""I don't think I'll ever have such a interactive learning experience again,"" she said. Cornis-Pop also enjoyed the now-retired Professor Charles Hamilton's introductory political science class her first year and English classes taught by Professors Richard Locke and Edward Mendelson. The salutatorian delivered her salutatory yesterday at Columbia College Commencement, praising the Core Cirriculum, the pursuit of extracurriculars, and even the diversity of Columbia's housing. Cornis-Pop didn't want to make any waves as she read from her five-page doublespaced speech. Her goal in was simple: to say that she had a great time at Columbia.""I don't care if it sounds like I'm kissing up. I'm the poster-child for the Core."""
306,Linebacker Craig Brown Faces Fordham Friends,13 September 2000,"BY JONATHAN FOX Columbia Daily SpectatorWhen junior Craig Brown peers across the line of scrimmage on Saturday night, he will see many familiar faces. That's because the inside linebacker for the Lions spent his first year in college playing for the Fordham Rams. Columbia and Fordham both recruited Brown out of high school, but Brown opted for the Bronx instead of Manhattan. However, midway through his first year he realized he had passed up the opportunity to attend an Ivy League school. He said he wasn't as aware of the academic differences between the two schools when he chose Fordham. He enrolled at Columbia the following year, but he was ineligible for play as a sophomore due to NCAA regulations that any athlete who transfers within the same division has to sit out a year. Consequendy, Brown is very anxious for Saturday's season-opening game. To prepare for the fall, he spent the past summer at Columbia training hard with members of Columbia's football team on a strict regiment of sprinting and weightlifting. Despite his move from Rose Hill to Morningside Heights, Brown still keeps in touch with many of his former teammates, seeing them when he can. He has also introduced his Columbia teammates to his Fordham friends and, gridiron rivalry aside, they have even socialized on occasion. Last year both teams posted less-than stel-lar records. Columbia was 3-7 and Fordham was 0-11, but Brown said it's not wise to focus too much on past performance. Brown said his transition to the athletic program at Columbia has been ""real smooth."" ""The coaches have been more than accepting,"" Brown said, adding that he has met a lot of great people through Columbia football.And while he has found that the curriculum at Columbia is a little more demanding than that of its Bronx neighbor, he insists that his classes are ""not so bad."" Brown, a political science major, said many of his Fordham courses were able to count toward requirements at Columbia, but he still has to battle the Core: he took Literature Humanities as a sophomore and is currently taking Contemporary Civilization. Originally from Los Angeles, Brown grewup mesmerized by Raider running back Bo Jackson, his favorite player. At age 10, Brown read Jackson's autobiography and has always been ""overwhelmed"" by the athlete's skills on both the football and baseball fields. Brown attended high school in Milford, Massachusetts and played a number of positions on his school's football team including linebacker, fullback, and tight end. He also played four years of high school basketball. In his spare time away from the classroom and the gridiron, Brown enjoys listening to music and frequenting lounges downtown. While he doesn't play any instruments now, he hopes to someday. His musical career, however, will have to wait until at least Sunday morning. First, he has a score to settle with some old friends.He spent the summer training hard with members of the Columbia football team, running and lifting weights.Even off the field, former Fordham Ram linebacker Craig Brown always has football on the mind."
307,SOCRATIC DEBATE TURNED DRAMATIC REVIEW: THE PROPAGANDA PLAYS,15 September 2000,"REVIEW: THE PROPAGANDA PLAYSBY CASEY O'DONOHOE Spectator Theater EditorAs all good pseudo-intellectuals do, I have often wondered how exactly Columbia's Core Curriculum will affect my general being. When it comes down to my last moments, will it really matter that I read Homer and Plato? Micah Schraft, author of The Propaganda Plays, has apparently asked himself the same question. Chapter One, titled ""The Allegory of the Cave,"" takes place at Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. Sheila (Sheri Graubert), a chipper visiting student from London, would like a paper extension from her teacher, Mr. Cogdon (Adrian LaTourelle). She claims she does not understand Plato's Republic; her parents are getting a divorce; and she is having feminine problems. As the two engage in dialogue, Sheila becomes more and more impassioned about the text. She rips off her shoes and socks, and her barefootedness leads her to bear her most fundamental beliefs. She flits about, standing on Mr. Cogdon's desk and strewing papers around the stage to recreate Plato's cave. In the end, Sheila forces Mr. Cogdon to use the Republic, which she read for a class called ""Law and Morality,"" to admit to himself that he is sexually attracted to her. Mr. Cogdon gives Sheila an extension, and she offers him a red apple of garden temptation. Chapter Two, titled ""Atom and Devorah,"" takes place in a northeastern suburb. Atom (David Hornsby) is explaining his college thesis to his new stepmother, Devorah (Tatyana Yassukovich). He bandies about philosophical terms, speaking of ""the word"" of the Bible and Derida. Devorah munches on an apple all the while, and the two make conspicuous slips-of-the-tongue indicating their sexual attraction. Devorah convinces Atom to preach to her about mothers and sons, and in speaking of Mother's Day as a Nazi institution, he realizes how much never knowing his mother affected him. Devorah relives the circumstances that led to her giving up her child for adoption. Chapter Two ends with Atom curled up in Devorah'sexposed breast, the characters having resolved an Oedipus complex of sorts. Chapter Three, titled ""Natural Selection,"" takes place ostensibly at Columbia University. An older Sheila (Tatyana Yassukovich) interviews an older Atom (Adrian LaTourelle) about his new book, The Sequel. The Sequel considers questions of biotechnology and how it will accelerate natural selection. Sheila is clearly attracted to Atom, who also went to Exeter, while Atom is clearly molesting his intern Will (David Hornsby). When Atom and Will leave the stage, would-be intern Alice (Sheri Graubert) babbles about being an aerobics instructor and falling for the wrong men. At the climax of the chapter, Alice performs a scene from Hedda Gabler while Atom simultaneously shouts his theories. Sheila admits that she came from England for the interview because she had a sexual experience with Atom at Exeter, and Alice ends up fornicating with Will on the desk. The core of the ever-present apple is placed in a Ziploc bag with tweezers. Schraft manages to drive home his theme effectively. In each chapter, he shows that understanding or developing a stance on a particular intellectual issue often means eschewing the true self. The texts of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations are only useful insofar as they allow us to be open about our visceral, even carnal, desires. Columbia says we will ""develop a self,"" but Schraft seems to say that this self is not made up of fundamental beliefs about justice; it is knowing that what we really want is not necessarily moral or good. In fact, at each turn it is the person who is ignorant of intellectual concepts who understands: Sheila, a student who is still learning; Devorah, the uneducated woman from Georgia; and Alice, a ditzy aerobics instructor. The Propaganda Plays is not as strong dramatically as it is thematically. At times, Schraft seems merely to replicate a session of Lit Hum. All of the actors handle the script beautifully, with direction from Trip Cullman, moving easily between its naturalistic and surreal pieces. Schraft pushes the limits ofdrama, an art form that usually relies on ""showing"" its theme rather than telling it, by making a Socratic debate the main action of his play However, innovation and quality performance don't change the fact that The Propaganda Plays is simply on the dry side. Set designer Sandra Goldmark handles the play with the utmost subtlety. The walls of Dixon Place are covered in papi-er-mache to resemble a cave, and the whole stage smacks of cold, sterile blue. Matthew Richards' lighting whips from cheery, Exeter sun to dark, eerie Platonic cave, and from grey day in the suburbs to spotlighted home pulpit. The Propaganda Plays is the kind of play that should almost be viewed more than once to digest its full symbolism. Schraft weaves together so many ideas and texts that the audience leaves the theater swimming in a pool of intellectual uncertainty. Dry as it may be live, its aftertaste is so rich, it's nauseating. The Propaganda Plays opened Sept. 9 at Dixon Place (309 E. 26th Street) and runs through Sept. 23. Performances are Thursdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m. Tickets are $l2 in advance, $l5 at the door, $8 for students/seniors/Dixon Place members.

308,Hamilton Classrooms to Get Overhaul,26 September 2000,"BY KATHERINE ISOKAWA Columbia Daily SpectatorFor the hundreds of students and professors tired of Hamilton Hall's small desks, cramped quarters, and hot rooms, help is on the way. Plans are in the works that will redesign Hamilton's classrooms and make the building the home of a new Core Curriculum office. According to Joe lenuso, assistant vice president for facilities management, finance, and administrative services, the renovations will upgrade the quality and condition of classrooms and redesign the lobby. ""We recognize that Hamilton Hall is really the home of Columbia College,"" lenuso said. 'We're really hoping to finalize the plans this academic year."" Dr. Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum, said she hopes the move of the Core Curriculum office to more spacious quarters will bring greater unity to the Core.Gillooly said that after the renovation, students would ""begin to experience the connections within the Core. It is what makes a Columbia education."" According to Gillooly, the office will include the Office of the Core, a seminar room and a meeting room, as well as a lending library for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization professors and instructors. Hamilton Hall is currently the location of the Undergraduate Admissions Office, as well as the Office of the Dean, both of which will move elsewhere within the building, Gillooly said. During the school year, Hamilton Hall houses approximately one-third of the classes managed by the Registrar of Columbia University. lenuso said that this is why an objective of the project is to keep the building operating during renovation. The actual renovation should take several years. Although amajority of the work would be done over the summer, summer session students would not be displaced, lenuso said. The plans for renovation are currently in the investigation stage, lenuso said. This stage includes inspection of the building's systems such as heating and electricity. lenuso and his office are working with Dean Austin Quigley of Columbia College and an architect to plan these changes. Two rooms in Hamilton Hall have already been remodeled as prototypes for the renovation of the whole building. Room 402 has been renovated into a seminar-style classroom, with a large table and 18-21 surrounding chairs. Room 507 has been renovated into a small classroom, with 30-40 movable seats. Changes to rooms 402 and 507 also include the addition of new carpeting, lighting and wooden wainscoting to Room 402 and colorful tile as well as light blue walls to Room 507. 'These are all attempts to make the room more interesting and introduce some warmth to the teaching space,"" lenuso said.The purpose of these prototype classrooms, according to lenuso, is feedback. Decisions on how many of each type of classroom to build will be made based on this feedback. ""We want to take what is successful from those rooms and replicate that. We want to get feedback from folks. That was our real objective,"" lenuso said. Mike Rubin, CC 'O4, said that he preferred the seminar-style classrooms. ""It's conducive to communication and fosters a round-table discussion atmosphere,"" Rubin said. ""Everyone can be seen. It's not like a lecture setting."" However, some students felt that other renovations were necessary as well. Several students expressed dissatisfaction with Hamilton's elevator system. ""The elevators are too slow. Ihave to race up those crowded stairs every morning,"" Nuria Net, CC 'O4, said. Katie Burlingham, BC 'Ol said she feels that other renovations such as equipping Hamilton's class-rooms with bigger desks and the technology to show computer presentations are needed. ""You'd think there's so much money in this school that they could spend some on renovations, Burlingham said. Political Science professor Doug Chalmers, who teaches Contemporary Civilization in Hamilton, said that he felt that any renovation would be incomplete without an update in classroom technology. ""There clearly ought to be a major investment in some number of electronic classrooms. Thereshould be at least a capacity to show transparencies, but by this time there really should be the ability to project computer images or web images,"" Chalmers said. The building does have a certain charm to some. Net added that she liked the building's old-fashioned feeling, the windows that let light into the classrooms, and the wooden chairs and desks. ""There's a kind of old-fashioned gracefulness to the classrooms that I hope doesn't get destroyed,"" Chalmers said. ""The basic architecture seems to be fine. I'd hate to see major changes.""'You'd think there's so much money in this school that they could spend some on renovations.' —Katie Birmingham, BC 'OlOver the next several years, Hamilton's old-style classrooms will get full overhauls.

309,Defining Vegetarianism And its Popularity,29 September 2000,"BY MARIEL WOLFSON Spectator Food WriterIt might come as a surprise to today's cosmopolitan students that the term ""vegetarian"" was not even coined until the year 1847. Prior to that date, those who ate a meatless diet were known as ""pythagoreans."" If this recalls a certain mathematical ditty from your high-school geometry days, don't be alarmed. Vegetarianism has a long and illustrious history that does indeed date back to the days of our Greek friends from Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations. In addition to Pythagoras, Plato and Socrates are also known to have abstained from meat. It has even been proposed that the kallipolis of Plato's Republic is a vegetarian city (sophomore alert: potential paper topic!). But vegetarianism probably belongs even more to the Eastern tradition. Gautama the Buddha, Mahavira, founder of the Jains, and Taoist sage Lao Tzu are but a sampling of Easterners who figure prominently into the history of vegetarianism, not to mention the history of the world's religions. Once we start tracing the vegetarian ideal back to its origins, it becomes difficult to locate its genesis at any particular date and place. After all, prehistoric humans —living before the days of Ferris Booth Commons —probably gathered berries from the friendly shrubs nearby before venturing out to slaughter hairy, fanged, ferocious beasts. Let's just say that vegetarians have existed for a long, long time, and leave it at that. There is no dearth of notable early vegetarians. Perhaps you've heard of a Mr. Jesus Christ? Apparently he was quite a fan of barley and lentils. In the interest of bringing ourselves up-to-date, we must jump ahead through the centuries to some of the more colorful figures in vegetarian history. It was at a meeting in London in 1847 that the term ""vegetarian"" first came into being with the formation of theVegetarian Society, a progressive group that included several religious leaders, and of which Mahatma Gandhi would later be a part. Within a few years, they were publishing a magazine, The Vegetarian Messenger. Across the Atlantic, vegetarianism figured prominently into the reformist spirit of the American transcendentalists. For example, Bronson Alcott, father of Louisa May was an educational reformer who started a vegetarian commune called Fruitlands in rural Massachusetts. Alcott traveled in the same circles as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, who was generally averse to meat. He was also a friend of one of the greatest berry-fiends of all time, John Harvey Kellogg, who is known more for the Corn Flake empire he started than for his vegetarianism. But his invention of breakfast cereals was a response to the traditional American breakfast of ham andeggs, which Kellogg, an accomplished abdominal surgeon, viewed as detrimental to health. As if cereal wasn't enough, he invented peanut butter, again searching for an alternative to meat sandwiches. Kellogg was a Seventh Day Adventist, a religious sect that eschews meat. (Bet you never knew Corn Flakes had so much history.) Yet another familiar product, the graham cracker, was invented by none other than Sylvester Graham, who traveled around preaching the benefits of eating the whole grain of the wheat, rather than removing the bran. He developed ""Graham flour"" along these principles. (What would Sylvester say about Teddy Grahams?) Far from being a newfangled term, vegetarianism today has sub-categories of its own. ""Lacto-ovo"" vegetarians consume dairy and eggs but no flesh: one can also be ""lacto , consuming dairy but no eggs, or ""ovo"", consuming eggs but no dairy. The most stringent form of vegetarianism is to be ""vegan"", excluding all animal products from one's diet.For more information on vegetarian nutrition, history, and general issues, check out these websites: The International Vegetarian Union: www.ivu.org The Vegetarian Resource Group: www.vrg.org These are good all-around nutrition sites, not just vegetarian: Tufts University Nutrition Navigator: www.navigator.tufts.edu Mayo Clinic Health Oasis: www.mayohealth.org For more information on vegetarian history, check out these books by Rynn Berry: Famous Vegetarians and their Favorite Recipes Food for the Gods: Vegetarianism & the World's Religions The New Vegetarians"
310,Classroom Transfers Problematic,2 October 2000,"BY KATHERINE HAENSCHEN Columbia Daily SpectatorAlmost one-quarter of the 114 Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization sections have tried to switch venues, but only five have received transfers. 'This year it seems to me that we're feeling more pressure than we ever have before,"" said Dr. Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum and a professor in the English Department. Political Science Professor Andrew Nathan has noticed the same thing. ""I've taught here for 29 years,""he said. ""I've tried to change some rooms. Sometimes it's yes, sometimes it's no. But it seems harder now that it did before."" When a situation warrants a class switch, the instructor goes either to the department or straight to Lenore Hubner, assistant registrar. Hubner then attempts to make the switch, if possible. ""We try to honor these requests whenever we can,"" Deputy Registrar John Carter said. 'What limits us sometimes is the availability of rooms at peak meeting times."" Carter could not site the percentage of classes that request a change, but said that ""it is small, especially in light of the number of classes we schedule.""""Generally [instructors request a room change] because the enrollment has outgrown the size of the room,"" Carter said. Professors also request transfers because of poor acoustics, uncomfortable heating, noise, or a lack of windows in the classroom. In a case when the change cannot be made due to a lack of available rooms, Manager of Facility Design and Construction Wilfred Small will try to modify the classroom to accommodate the faculty and students. ""Different instructors have different requirements and expectations for their rooms,"" Small said. ""Whenever a particular professor finds some condition critically interferes with his or her instruction, we treat that very seriously and moveto resolve it right away."" The registrar has a plan where different departments schedule courses using the full spectrum of available hours. Certain disciplines are supposed to schedule their classes on certain days at certain times. If every department followed the suggested plan, room transfers would be less likely to occur. Faculty members have had varied experiences with the Office of the Registrar in trying to correct classroom deficiencies. Barbara Locurto, the departmental administrator for the History Department, says that her department ""anticipates large classes and gets appropriate rooms."" If there is a problem, Hubner is generally able to work it out. ""The Office of the Registrar has always been most helpful in trying to handle our requests,"" said Angela Reid, the department administrator for the Economics Department. ""Sometimes it was just beyond their control. If there isn't a larger classroom, you just can't create one on the spot."" Nancy Gajee, the departmental administrator of the Italian Department, says her department is often able to engineer their own classroom swaps. ""This semester an instructor knew someone who was teaching in a bigger classroom,"" she said. ""We switched between them and let the registrar know afterwards."" The Mathematics Department was able to orchestrate a room switch of its own last semester as well. Mary Young, the departmentaladminstrator for the Mathematics Department, was able to switch a class from Mathematics 520, which seats 50, to Mathematics 507, which seats 20. ""It was easy to switch,"" Young said, ""because the Math Department controls Room 507."" She informed the registrar of the change afterwards. Nathan requested a room change for his Contemporary Civilization class. ""It isn't so much that the room was too small,"" he said, ""but that there is a noisy air conditioner"" that drowns out the lecture. He e-mailed Gillooly, who in turn e-mailed the registrar, but Nathan has yet to hear a response. As for the English Department, Gillooly says most classes are by instructor's permission only and so there is no real problem with overflow. She has also never had trouble scheduling her one senior seminar at a preferred time. ""It's more difficult than one would think, trying to predict enrollment,"" Gajee said. Gajee can normally use class figures from Introduction to Italian to base projections for the intermediate level, as well as taking into account historical enrollment numbers. Yet, ""for some reason this year, more decided to continue with Italian than in the past,"" Gajee said. Enrollment is capped at 20 per section, but ""though caps were reached, 30 kids showed up for some sections."" Even with approximately 1,200 students enrolled in Literature Humanities and fewer inContemporary Civilization, Gillooly doesn't have trouble predicting the sizes of her sections. Enrollment is capped at 22 students per class. Students have had classroom issues as well. Gerardo Flores, SEAS 'O3, had his Asian Civilization class moved. ""They opened the class to about 15 too many students,"" he said. ""They tried to hold it in the Math Building, and people were standingup."" Flores' section was eventually switched into Pupin. It took Maya Escueta, CC 'O2, and her 19th century philosophy class two weeks to switch to the classroom next door. Escueta describes the experience as ""ridiculous,"" adding that ""there were a lot of people on the floor."" However, Bari Handwerger's French literature class last spring didn't have any troubles. ""It was in a tiny Hamilton room that couldn't fit all 15 students,"" Handwerger said. ""The professor didn't have any trouble and got it switched to a bigger room in Philosophy.""Whenever a particular professor finds some [classroom] condition critically interferes with his or her instruction, we treat that very seriously and move to resolve it right away.' —Wilfred Small, Manager of Facility Design and ConstructionDeputy Registrar John Carter is hard at work. Carter is one of the few administrators responsible for classroom swaps."
311,Faculty Honored with Named Professorships,13 November 2000,"BY DAVID SOLOWAY Spectator Associate News Editor■ University recognizes skills and experience of three professors in English, Psychology, and Religion Depts.Three senior faculty members and staples of the Columbia community were appointed to named professorships at a Trustees meeting in early October. Michael Rosenthal was named the Roberta and William Campbell Professor in the Teaching of Literature Humanities, E. Tory Higgins was honored as the Stanley Schachter Professor of Psychology, and Robert Somerville will be the new Ada Tremaine Professor of Religion. Rosenthal, a scholar of the modern novel interested in British literature and culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, has spent much of his life on the Columbia campus, as a student, a professor, and an administrator. A long-time member of the Department of English and Comparative Literature, he received his Ph.D here in 1967, and went on to serve as an associate dean of Columbia College from 1972to 1989. But it is Rosenthal's support of and contribution to the Core Curriculum for which he is most often recognized, having served for years as one of its major proponents. ""I was both surprised and pleased [to have been honored by the Trustees],"" Rosenthal said. ""And I was especially pleased to receive an honor that was closely associated with teaching in the Core."" Rosenthal, a winner of the Alexander Hamilton Medal in 1989 and the Mark Van Doren Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1994, also attached significance to the fact that he considers both Roberta and William Campbell, the donors of the professorship, to be friends. The author of Virginia Woolf Hie Character Factory: Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts, and The Imperatives of Empire, Rosenthal is currently working on a biography of formerColumbia University President Nicholas Murray Butler. Higgins, who like Rosenthal received his Ph.D from Columbia,returned to the campus in 1989 as a professor in the Psychology Department. In 1996, he received the Donald T. Campbell Award from the Society for Personalityand Social Psychology, the highest honor in the field of social psycholo-gy, and in 1999 he was honored with the Thomas 0 strom Award in Social Cognition. More recently, he received the William James Award from the AmericanPsychological DistinguishedSociety for Achievements in"
312,Core Profs. Honored in Ceremony,15 November 2000,"BY AMBA DATTA Spectator Staff Writer■ Speakers award gifted faculty, discuss concerns for future of the Core.During a ceremony marked by concern about the future of what Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley termed the ""intellectual signature"" of the College, Professors Robert Belknap and Richard Kuhns were honored with the annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum. Held in the Heyman Humanities Center last evening, the ceremony featured several speakers lauding the contributions to the Core made by Belknap, professor in the Slavic Languages and Literature Department, and Kuhns, professor emeritus of philosophy. Professor J. W. Smit, the Queen Wilhelmina Professor of the History, Language, and Literature of the Netherlands, received a special award in recognition of his accomplishment as the only professor to have taught the four Core Curriculum classes: Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. While the evening focused on celebrating the professors' achievements and the continued existence of the Core, both the speakers and honorees expressed their concerns about the future of the Core in the face of the College's expanding population. Michael Rosenthal, professor of English and Comparative Literature, spoke on the difficulties of staffing the Core Curriculum, which requires a large number of professors and instructors for all the class sections, which are capped at 22 students. ""No one before [Smit] has had the range, capacity, and commitment to teach all four [courses]... He is a man who has totally embodied and internalized the values of the Core,"" Rosenthal said. John Rosenberg, the William Peter field Trent professor ofEnglish and Comparative Literature, noting that students in his classes often have to go into other classrooms to find enough chairs, emphasized the need to cap the size of Core classes and his own concern over the expansion of the College. He also expressed concern over the increase in the number of sections of Core classes. 'This is wonderful from one perspective,"" he said. ""From another, it's the end of the collegiality of the staff,"" referring to the different levels of experience that Core preceptors and professors have. Smit also had concerns, particularly in connection with the expertise of instructors of the Core Curriculum saying that ""the question of whether we are serving our students as well"" should be examined."" Smit made a comparison to Pericles' funeral oration in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War when he said ""I think what we learn from those classical texts is how fast an ideal state can be changed.""He urged necessary planning for the future of Core Curriculum staffing before a true celebration of the Core Curriculum could be held. ""Only when we have made that decision do we have the right to celebrate being here together,"" Smit said. Quigley responded to these concerns and emphasized administrative awareness of staffing problems with the Core. Quigley said that as of now, the Administration is addressing concerns through an Endowment for the Core, an ongoing fundraising activity. He said the endowment will probably provide for approximately 10 Core chairs awarded on a rotating basis for fiveyear terms. Quigley was not surprised by the honorees' concerns. 'This is a conversation that goes on in the background all the time,"" he said. ""I was glad [to have] the opportunity to be able to address what we're doing."" Belknap received his Ph.D from Columbia in 1960. He served as director of the Russian Institute, now known as the Harriman Institute, from 1974-1977 and is anauthority on Dostoevsky. He currently teaches the Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and 19th Century Russian Drama courses, as well as Literature Humanities. Belknap has also published works analyzing plots in narrative and drama. Kuhns also received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1960. He specializes in aesthetics and has written on classical philosophy and drama. As a teacher of Literature Humanities as well, Kuhns is particularly interested in Apuleius' The Golden Ass and Boccaccio's The Decameron. Rosenberg observed that it was particularly appropriate that Kuhns and Belknap receive the award together. Kuhns and Belknap coauthored Tradition and Innovation, General Education and the Reintegration of the University in 1977. It covered, Rosenberg said, a time when the ""disintegration of the university and nation seemed a closer reality than reintegration."" Additionally, the two instituted a series of seminars in the 1970s on general education encompassing the different schools of the University.""Both have sustained their commitment to general education for over four decades,"" said Rosenberg. Director of the Heyman Humanities Center, Professor Wm. Theodore de Bary said that both professors have been ""identified long with not only the Core Curriculum and humanities courses but with the whole idea of generaleducation as exemplified by the Core Curriculum."" All the speakers praised the two professors' commitment to the Core Curriculum. ""We clearly owe a special debt to the faculty who have been dedicated to maintaining its vitality and excellence,"" Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen said.Vice President for Arts and Sciences David Cohen, right, honored Professor Robert Belknap for his service to the Core Curriculum.Professor Emeritus Richard Kuhns, center, accepted his honor last night.

313,In Our Pages 15 Years Ago,22 January 2001,"The following stories appeared in the Columbia Daily Spectator during the week of January 20, 1986. Law School Dean named Columbia named Law Professor Barbara Black as the Dean of Columbia Law School. Black was the first woman to lead a prestigious law school in the nation. She was an obvious choice, said the Provost. In an editorial praising the appointment, the Spectator wrote, 'Ten years ago, if a female law school graduate hadn't taken a few semesters of typing and shorthand, she might not have found a job... Black, who described clinging to a career by her fingernails while she took time off to raise her children, has also shown that such a non-traditional path need not preclude eminence."" Jane Austen Now Required on spring Literature Humanities syllabus Austen's Pride and Prejudice became the first novel by a female author to appear as mandatory reading on the Literature Humanities syllabus. Previously, works by women could fill space at the end of the semester if time allowed, and professors used works by Virginia Woolf, George Eliot, and Austen. A former chair of the Lit Hum program ""admitted that some members of the facultyfelt that Austen's work was not 'relevant' to the rest of the syllabus but said her significance as a respected woman author was more important than the work's ability to 'stand up by itself.'"" ""Faculty members disagreed on whether the work chosen ought to directly discuss isues of feminism or whether it was necessary only that the selection be written by a woman. It was strongly felt that the work chosen should not ... [in the words of one faculty member], 'smack of tokenism.'"" The move was part of a larger reevaluation of the course, in which professors argued about the importance of including works that accurately represented the diverse heritages of the students who would read the books. Lions are in over their heads The Columbia men's basketball team found itself not quite measuring up to competition, as it lacked enough tall post players—a player at 6'4"" was among the tallest on the team —to compete with other teams in the league. The height disadvantage showed up in several of the head coach's assessments of the team: ""Because of our physical shortcomings—no pun intended —we have to play near errorfree ball."" ""Penn is head and shoulders above everyone else."""
314,Where's the Money?,25 January 2001,"The Weissing on the Cake By Kike WeissColumbia University just completed a $2.8 billion fundraising campaign. Hmm. And none of my friends can get into any of their classes. Junior and senior years at Columbia traditionally involve a movement away from the core curriculum into more specialized classes within their range of interests. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations are replaced by 4000-level classes like Post-Pre-Industrial Colonization and its Raphaelite Transgender Affirmation of the American Male in (hyper) Popular and Non-Specific Anti-Culture. (I haven't taken it; I hear it's all Teaching Assistants.) Lectures are replaced by seminars, graduate students are replaced by actual professors, and everyone is meant to begin a beautiful two-year period of general enlightenment. The only problem is, of course, that all the classes are full. Anything that sounds interesting has been pre-pre-registered for, with students buttering up their prospective professors months before registration. Lists of hopeful students are compiled, wait lists develop, and suddenly we have created a twice-annual expectation that all students must stand in intellectual bread lines, waiting for their esteemed professors to hand them the sustenance that they crave deep down in unspeakable parts of the human psyche next to recipes for pot brownies and Wilson Phillips lyrics. So where has this $2.8 billion injection into our already cushy endowment gone? We have a new student center that came in a scant $26 million over-budget. The sod on South Lawn is replaced every couple of months, and it remains green for about two and a half days, until the South American Amateur Soccer League hears that its field has been repaired. Lions Court is still made out of corrugated metal, and it is still destroying the campus's claim to aesthetic pride. There should be plenty of leftover cash. Why haven't new professors been hired? The English department is not crowded. There is plenty of room for more professors. No one would object. Why is it that when $3 billion are raised, classes are still shutting students out at record rates? Shouldn't hiring new professors be the very first expenditure for a school that has just successfully raised more money than anyone could ever be expected to count? Of course, I could be just another radical peacenik speaking off the cuff and tellin' it like it is. Money is wasted at this school by the truckload. We throw parties every night of the week in Low Rotunda, and I have yet to be invited. Not once. George Rupp's bi-monthlytrip to the beauty salon? Columbia picks up the tab. Granite-and marble-stud our campus, their expense belied by their inability to offer traction in slippery conditions. And granite and marble do not come cheap. Lions. They are two of the most expensive rocks on the market, coming in just after The Rock. It costs $35,000 to go to this college, a price tag that increases at about a 2.5 to 3.0 percent rate, never mind that the inflation rate over the past ten years has hovered at about 1.2 percent. What does that mean, all you nonecon majors? It means that it is damn expensive to go to this school. A lot of parents would be shocked to learn that during their children's first two years at Columbia College, they were taught by graduate students in Lit Hum, C.C., Logic and Rhetoric, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. It's not necessarily a waste of money to have a professor-free college education; but then again watching Road Rules and The Real World compete in a tattoo contest in Park City, Utah isn't a complete waste of time either. Which is to say that it, is a waste of money to attend a college where it is more difficult to take a class with an actual professor than it is to receive an A.' Two point eight billion American dollars. The possibilities are endless. They're difficult to imagine. Columbia could buy its own XFL team, the New York Teaching Assistants. We could fund a program to teach undergraduates and high school students how to teach college classes, to free up busy graduate students who are composing their theses on Formations of Sexual Identity: Pre-Acculturalized Art and Artifact in Post-Radio Indochina. We could hire Emeril Lagasse to be the chef de cuisine at John Jay Dining Hall. (""You left your card in your dorm room? BAM! You need your card there brother, BAM!!!"") All ""zany"" ""off-beat"" ideas aside, Columbia University should hire more degree-bearing, actual professors. To teach classes. It's a simple concept, something I've been working on over the past few weeks. I believe that upperclassmen have earned a class or two that wasn't taught by a wet-behind-the-ears, jumpy, unprofessional, whiny, incompetent graduate student who can't find the remote control to turn off the lights so that he can show the class a riveting video covering the mating habits of poisonous tree frogs and their analogous place in a feminist understanding of the worker's representation in print media. More professors is a simple, good idea.Mike Weiss is a Columbia College junior majoring in English and Comparative Literature."
315,New English Head Returns to Philosophy Hall,31 January 2001,"By David Soloway Spectator Staff WriterCould the third time be a charm? Jonathan Arac, who had separate stints as a visiting associate professor and a recruited tenured professor more than 10 years ago, will be back roaming Philosophy Hall five months fromtomorrow. But this time he will be in charge. The search process that began formally in October of 1999 ended lastmonth with the introduction of Arac as the next chairman of the Department of English and Comparative Literature. He will replace Classics/History Professor Roger Bagnall, who was appointed acting chair of the department in August. Professor Jean Howard, a colleague of Arac's during his 19871989 stretch at Columbia, echoed the sentiments of most faculty members when she praised the promise of Arac's appointment. ""I found him to be a thoroughly decent person and a passionate intellectual who loves the life of the mind,"" Howard said of Arac, whoalso taught in the English department from 1981-1982. ""He will be an excellent leader for the department and hold us all to a high standard in making appointments."" Despite the fact that Arac, who currently teaches at the University of Pittsburgh, will not assume control until the end of this academic year, he is already busy preparing for his first few days back in New York. ""It has already started,"" Arac said from his Pennsylvania home. ""I am in regular contact with Bagnall and [Vice President for Arts and Sciences David] Cohen about departmental matters, and I talk frequently with members of the department."" But why return to Morningside Heights to lead a department that has been mired in conflict over the past 18 months? After all, Arac admitted that when he left Columbia in 1989, he had no idea whether he might return. ""I would never have wished to return to Columbia without having great hopes for the excitement of being a part of such a group of students and colleagues,"" Arac said. The 19th-century British and American culture and literature expert fondly remembered the dayshe spent teaching both undergraduate and graduate students. From Literature Humanities to an introductory English course for General Studies students to multiple graduate seminars, Arac never tired of the daily grinds of teaching. ""I remember from my previous experience that Columbia students, from Lit Hum through doctoral seminars, are a wonderful pleasure to work with, and my colleagues tell me that the students now are even better than they were before,"" said Arac, who has won awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the U.S. Information Agency, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Ford Foundation. And as if that wasn't enough, Arac found it hard to resist an opportunity to rejoin many of his friends and fellow professors in a department with which he has never lost touch. Arac was University Professor Edward Said's teaching fellow at Harvard summer school in 1968. He and Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature Ann Douglas were junior colleagues at Princeton in the 19705. Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities Gayatri Spivak and Aracwere colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh around 1990, after Arac had left Columbia for Pittsburgh and before she did the reverse. And after leaving Columbia, Arac has continued to serve on the doctoral committees of many students, including one whose dissertation will be considered in the near future. ""Over the last 15 months, since the search process began, I have been delighted to renew my conversations with many faculty colleagues, whose intelligence and vitality of mind, together with professional seriousness, give me the highest hopes for what we can accomplish together,"" Arac said. But Arac is still well aware of the challenges he will face from the moment he arrives and has alreadyheard many of his future colleagues' complaints and grievances. ""No chairman has ever had a trouble-free term,"" Arac said. ""But I believe the department is ready to go forward and do what is necessary."" He and his colleagues indeed foresee greatness in the future of their department. Arac said he hopes ""to restore the departmental faculty's pleasure in collegial conversation, so as to make possible our renewed effective attention in a shared way to our teaching and programmatic responsibilities, which in turn requires that we recruit to Columbia a significant number of new colleagues, both junior and senior."" Howard, who sees Arac as a chair who will be ""fair and judicious"" and one who has ""demon-strated concern for the well-being of junior faculty,"" added that she expects ""to see the English Department flourish under his leadership."" Arac is not overly concerned with the fact that the English department has not had a permanent chair in almost two years. ""All senior recruitments take a long time,"" he said, adding that finding a chair is not an overnight project. With plans to remain a staple of the Columbia community long after his three-year term as chair reaches its completion, Arac's odyssey appears to have come to an end. But instead of coming home to Penelope and Telemachus, Arac will return to mandatory meetings and bureaucratic obstacles. Tough break.Jonathan Arac"
316,Riding Buckets and Bearing Libation: Two Directors on Their Craft,23 February 2001,"By R. Eric Thomas Spectator Staff WriterThis weekend, the Barnard Theater Department presents its annual senior thesis festival, showcasing the work of the programs' most experienced students. In addition to The Yellow Wallpaper and Wedding on the Eiffel Tower, Minor Latham Playhouse will play home to Sally Oswald's, BC'Ol, adaptation of The Libation Bearers, a directing thesis, as well as Bucket Rider: A Play from Franz Kafka, written and directed by Zuzanna Szadkowski, BC' 01. Each director has taken a unique spin on a well-established text and, in doing so, has produced a distinctive and exciting piece of theater. Spectator spoke with both Oswald and Szadkowski about their theses and about the craft of theater. On the plays Oswald: I've been doing research on choruses for about a year now, and I was going to do a Greek tragedy, and then I said, 'Which one?' I also wanted to do The Suppliants, but that play has a chorus of 50 women who murder their 50 fiances. Szadkowski: Bucket Rider is my playwrighting thesis as well as my directing thesis, so in the process of searching for a play, I was writing a lot of different things. It was suggested to me by my professor as something I might want to do. [.Bucket Rider] is a story from a larger collection called A Country Doctor by Franz Kafka. Oswald: Since I didn't really want to go [the route of The Suppliants], I thought Libation Bearers would be a good one. I also thought it was nice since all[Literature Humanities] students have to read it. I just got a sadistic kick out of that. People flip out. Greek tragedy is painful, or like torture. People see it as a reading assignment, not something that can be done. On directing one's own work Szadkowski: It's both difficult and cool in that, as a playwright, my play can go through a sort of workshop process. I tried to work with it once we turned to the directing, as sort of an established piece, but it'sgone through some changes. I've had the opportunity to really look at the play and rework some things. I also have to really work hard to step back and make sure that things are understood. There has to be some separation there. I think the best thing about it is that the theatre department gave me the opportunity to write something and then have it realized and direct it. I have a really amazing set and production design. The production values for this play are really great.On the subjects Szadkowski: [Bucket Rider] is a very short story about a man who needs to get some coal because it's really very cold. He goes to a coal dealer for some help, basically So, I took the story and dug into the details of the coal dealer's family. You have this relatively short play that is kind of an attempt to stage the larger Kafka story. It's very securely based in the short story, but I took a lot of license. Oswald: I'm framing [The Libation Bearers\ in a 1930s police station. It's based on tabloid photojournalism from the 19305. Everybody in the play is in the chorus and the main characters come out of that. Plus, I've musicalized the whole thing, so almost everything is sung. On goat songs Oswald: I don't know how I got involved in Greek Tragedy. I used to hate it. I used to say, 'this shit is the most boring shit ever.' I had to read Agamemnon in a theater history class once, and I shouldn't admit this, but I didn't read it. I thought, this is terrible and I'll never understand. I had this image of it as this solid rock that I couldn't get around and couldn't get in. And then when I was studying abroad in England and I had this really teacher and he was talking about etymology and saying that words have history and lives. One of the things he taught us was that tragedy means goat songs in the Greek. The Greek root of it is actually 'goat songs.' On the casts Oswald: I'm not having theoreti-cal conversations with the actresses. It's more in the context of the way we're doing this show —your character is doing this. It follows from there. Part of performing the part is just inhabiting the role. The chorus is widely seen as the backup, but they're more than that. In a lot of cases, they're one of tragiccharacters. Szadkowski: I think the auditions were really cool because although I didn't have any sort of preconceptions about who I was going to cast, I did have preconceptions about what kind of characters these were. And seeing the way people turned the text around, even i'A ""afidience, immediately' 'staffed to get me excited about the potential of these characters. The annual Senior Thesis Festival will run Feb. 22-25 at the Minor Latham Playhouse (117 th St. and Broadway). Bucket Rider: A Play from Franz Kafka and The Libation Bearers will perform Saturday, Feb. 24 and Sunday, Feb. 25 at 7:15 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., respectively. Performances are free and open to the public. No reservations necessary. Call the box office at 854-5638.'Bucket Rider is my playwriting thesis as well as my directing thesis, so in the process of searching for a play, I was writing a lot of different things.' —Zuzanna SzadkowskiHeigh ho Bucket !

317,Editorial Journal by Adam B. Kushner Unions Undermine Education,29 March 2001,"Unions Undermine EducationOn university campuses nationwide, the discussion continues over whether or not graduate students should have the right to unionize on campus. At issue is what a graduate student union might mean for the undergraduate students of Columbia. Unions hold the power to undermine the undergraduate education by striking and drawing other resources for the university. The Graduate Student Employees United (GSEU) has a motto: ""Columbia works because we do."" There is no doubt graduate student instructors play an integral role in the instruction of Core Curriculum classes like Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. Additionally, Columbia's lecture classes could not operate without the graduate teaching assistants who help to run them But because graduate students are so involved, a graduate student strike at Columbia —a very real possibility with unionization —could cripple nearly all of the requisite undergraduate curricula. If Core class instructors were to stop instructing, the Core would not work; a two-week strike might set an undergraduate's course of study back by an entire semester, postponing graduation orthe completion of a major. Imagine the potential undergraduate outcry that would ensue, calling for a refund in tuition, or an exemption from one or more of Columbia's Core classes. Additionally, a union will allow its members to bargain with the University about the number of hours they work each week. Though this could improve the lifestyles of Columbia's graduate students, it could also detract from the work —both inside and outside of the classroom —that instructors and teaching assistants would put into class preparation. Bargaining over hours could affect the quality of in-class instruction if instructors were not required to put in the appropriate amount of work for a section. While presenting a unified front against the University would certainly give graduate students leverage in negotiations for better pay and other benefits, graduate instructors and teaching assistants must not forget their importance to the continuity of undergraduate education. At a university like this, where such dependence is inevitable and irrefutable, the Administration and the graduate students must come to an arrangement by which they will not endanger this university's educational mission."
318,Listening to Quigley,9 April 2001,"By Ethan PerlsteinI emerged from the pages of Peter Kramer's extraordinary Listening to Prozac transformed and perplexed. During these past four years of college, of countless courses, books, and classroom discussions, a quarter of which I can't even begin to recall, no book has spoken to me so powerfully, so totally engaged me, as did Kramer's. For those who aren't familiar with his book, Kramer, a clinical psychiatrist at Brown, discusses how conceptions of the self require rethinking in this age of ""cosmetic psychopharmacology,"" as he calls it. Essential to his discussion are the stories of patients on the antidepressant Prozac who underwent astonishing metamorphoses of personality and temperament that could not be explained by traditional theories in psychiatry. One might rightly say that the content of Kramer's book —a mammoth, beautifully accomplished undertaking that spans psychotherapy, neurobiology, and medical ethics but especially people's journeys to greater self-understanding—naturally resonates with the curious, sensitive reader. That I felt totally engaged by his book, a spare-time read, took on greater significance the more I appreciated how I had been only partially engaged, in a purely intellectual way, by past curricular materials.It was precisely because Kramer's uniquely blended content —part intellectual, part personal—was absent from higher education. I realized that my total engagement with Kramer's book allowed me to speculate radically about the process and purpose of higher education, just as Kramer's own unprecedented consultations with his Prozac-medicated patients opened his eyes to new understandings of psychic processes in the human experience. My thinking coalesced further when I attended a forum that featured Deans Quigley and Galil speaking about strengthening ties between the Administration and students. Dean Quigley's thoroughness and thoughtfulness were pleasant surprises; both qualities vanquished my misconception of untouchable, uncaring bureaucrats. And he mentioned two things that immediately resonated with the impression left by Kramer's book. First, he spoke about the responsibility of the Administration to students to ensure that they were fully prepared for the highly demanding job market of tomorrow. Indeed, the future has a great deal in store for us. Although career versatility will be an invaluable asset, something equally vital to our futures is left out of the picture. I'm talking about interpersonal relationships in our careers, friendships, partnerships, etc. In short, when higher education focuses solelyon intellectual preparation—the time-tested traditional design—it only partially prepares us for our futures. Dean Quigley said he wanted to provide us with the tools to anticipate changes. Having exercised our cortex will do us tremendous good, but there's still the question of self-understanding, the chief tool by which we function as whole people, realizing all dimensions of adult experience. If we look around in society, it's pretty clear that self-understanding is sought after just as highly as, say, career success. Why do so many people call Dr. Laura, radio's pro bono pop psychologist, for life advice? Why is nearly every best-seller a self-help guide? And why do most of us know at least one person who has a pharmacological relationship with either licit or illicit mood-altering substances? There's a lot of searching going on, and we're no exception.So how would I go about tinkering with higher education? Three things come to mind: 1) fresh materials, like Kramer's book, could be infused into the Core Curriculum in the form of a course, or simply as a supplement, allowing all students to be exposed to the rich and generous history of thinking about the self. 2) Materials that we already read in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization could be explored in new, vibrant ways—Plato's allegory of the cave, for instance, could be an equally splendid metaphor of psychological self-awareness, with the shadows on the wall representing distorted, self-serving, or merely incomplete ways we understand people around us. 3) Workshops and seminars on interpersonal subjects—in line with what recently took place during Mental Health Awareness Week—could be created so that students get an opportunity to connect with themselves and their classmates and to explore topics like intimacy, relationships, and so forth with more sophistication. In conclusion, Dean Quigley spoke excitedly about a project in the works: a fourthyear senior course that would examine everything that was going on —artistically, politically, philosophically, combining CC, Lit Hum, and Major Cultures—in a part of the globe over a 200-year swath of time. I instantly appreciated the grandeur of his idea. Then I asked myself, ""What about an equally ambitious, radical course that seeks to achieve the same goal, unity of understanding, but for students' lives, tying together four years of both intellectual achievement and psychological self-growth?""The author is a Columbia College senior majoring in sociology.Self-understanding is desired as much as a career.Plato's Cave can be a psychological metaphor."
319,GS Student Council Candidates Debate,10 April 2001,"By EThan Glickstein Spectator Staff Writer■ Hopefuls discuss connection between GS and University community.In preparation for Wendesday's General Studies Student Council (GSSC) election, a candidate forum was held last night in Lewisohn Hall. The inclusion of General Studies students into the Columbia community was the most discussed question of the evening, with all candidates advocating for more and better housing options for General Studies students. Candidate for president of the GSSC Courtney Freeman and her vice presidential candidate Raul Reyes are part of the Students Excelling through experience (SEX) party, and are opposed by presidential candidate Michael Nadler and vice presidential candidate Mason Beard from the Students Maximizing Academic Resources for Today and Tomorrow (SMART) party. Additionally, Jimmy Dahroug is running for vice president on his own ticket. Last night's forum was moderated by Spectator Editorial Page Editor Adam Kushner. About 35 people turned out for the debate, which was mostly civil. ""We pay tuition just like anyone else. We pay $25,000 a year plus rent, which costs more than dorms,"" Freeman said. At one point, Freeman slipped and said, ""When I'm president—l mean if,"" while her opposition mouthed the word ""if."" Dahroug proposed a residence exchange between Columbia College students who want to live inapartments and General Studies students who want the community atmosphere of dorms. Reyes disagreed with Dahroug. ""I don't want to live in dorms, and even if I did, we have the last dorm selection out of all the schools,"" he said. Nadler also focused on the theme of unequal treatment for General Studies students. ""We can't hold executive positions in a lot of clubs, and there are less minors available to us as well,"" he said. Other major topics of the debate included the separate core curriculum for General Studies students. Both SMART and SEX promoted adding Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization to the General Studies core, putting all students on equal footing for more advanced classes. Financial aid also came up during the debate, with Dahroug noting he ""received higher financial aid packages from every other college that I applied to. We have to talk to people and get this increased."" In response to questions about working with the Administration, Nadler maintained, ""The Dean's office is our branch for progress, and I am not satisfied with taking 'no' for an answer from the Dean. I'm comfortable doing this becauseI already work with the Dean."" On the other hand, Freeman said he believes that General Studies students need ""to make sure the Dean is acting on our behalf, so I want to set up a liaison to make sure we know what the Dean is doing."" Nadler cited a problem in forming a consensus among the students because the General Studies student body, including many parttime students, is so diverse. He advocated a suggestion box in the student lounge, but Freeman was adamant in her calls for a survey to learn about the issues most important to General Studies students. Mason commented that organizing social events is a significant part of being on the student council, but Reyes said, ""I won't remember social events. I want to remember making changes."" Audience members had varied reactions to the debate. ""It was respectful, not ugly at all. I thought they were all very intelligent, but I wanted to hear more about themselves. They talked about the issues but not themselves,"" GS student Emma Leybin said. ""It was stereotypical. Nobody was making promises, but they were just saying 'l'll try my best.' I'm curious to see whether they actually do anything though,"" GS student Sonya Chittiappa said.General Studies Student Council candidates participated in a debate last night in Lewisohn Hall."
320,Gorillas in Our Midst The Wacky World of Rut Row,10 April 2001,"By Aimee Cabrera Spectacle Staff Writer""...And we had another song idea, about a gorilla."" It's Sunday afternoon, and the Columbia band Rut Row is explaining its songwriting process to me. Sophomore drummer Scott Hunter drawled on, ""Allegedly the drummer, um, got conjunctivitis because a gorilla came in his eye in Amsterdam."" ""Not really a gorilla, per se,"" junior guitarist Ned Ehrbar interjected,"" but a man in a gorilla suit with a strap-on. ""That shoots water,"" Hunter said. ""It's part of a sex stage show,"" Ehrbar added. I asked, ""So it's not actual, um..."" ""Semen?"" Ehrbar finished the though for me. ""I hope not,"" Hunter sighs. ""It didn't smell like anything. It smelled... It didn't... I was kind of covered in it, as were the people to my left and right, but none of them got it in their eye directly, 50..."" ""That was payback for the tequila, actually,"" Ehrbar told him. Perhaps this all requires a bit of explanation. The four-piece ensemble (Hunter, Ehrbar, sophomore bassist Paul Campion, and singer Maria Aggabao, who couldn't make the interview) conceived last Bastille Day, played its first show in November, and recorded an EP the next day. It's a Hit has since sold out, but can be downloaded, along with some new and live tracks, at the band's website, rut-row.com. They've started to develop a reputation for their live show, which includes punk rock covers of Sarah McLachlan's ""Good To You"" and 'Touch-A, Touch-A Touch Me,"" from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The live act is also full of onstage banter and some harmless sexual suggestion, punctuated by Ehrbar's fire breathing and the band's shooting tequila at the audience. With a gun. 'The tequila gun was actually my friend Jessica's idea. We would just sit at the bar andthink of ideas... And we're like, The Love Gun.' We'll have a squirt gun full of margaritas."" After discovering that margarita mix clogged up the nozzle, the band tried tequila, but as Hunter tells it: 'We filled it with tequila, and we were shooting it at everybody. Aid then I shot Ned in the eye with pure tequila, and we decided it would be best if we watered it down a little."" Hence Ehrbar's payback reference. On the surface, Rut Row seems like a pretty upbeat band. The name Rut Row comes from a cartoon, for heaven's sake (from Hunter's Scooby-doo impression, to be specific), and was the last in a line ofnames that included Fickle (""Get on stage and be like, 'Hi, we're Fickle'""), Cockfight, and the West Harlem Tabernacle Choir. But, as a few listens to the 12 tracks available at the band's website will reveal, the paper screen of pop punk hides a brick wall. Ehrbar, who wrote most of the songs on the band's website, used to be in an alternativepop band, which he describes as ""too happy."" The relatively happy music of Rut Row is counteracted by surprisingly dark lyrics. ""My heart will not break for you again,"" Aggabao proclaims with bluesy vixen vocals on ""Good Samaritan."" ""I write stuff about unhappy stuff,"" Ehrbar says matter-of factly. ""I don't have a happy song."" The songs don't get much happier when the entire band gets in on the songwriting process. 'We wrote Yet' as a team,"" Ehrbar says, ""and those are the meanest lyrics I've ever seen."" ""Yet"" is almost a funk-punk rocker whose chorus begins with Aggabao raging, ""I'm not through with you yet / You're gonnawish we never met,"" and whose climax is ""I'll make you bleed."" ""I think we were just frustrated with our inability to write a song,"" Campion jokes. Campion is an ex-geek rocker, of which he says, ""Geek rock has a limited audience, if not a faithful one... I knew I had to rock harder. So I teamed up with Ned [Ehrbar, whom he knew from writing at The Fed] on Bastille Day."" Campion met Hunter in Literature Humanities, and called him in after he and Ehrbar decided to form a band. Hunter used to be a jazz drummer, a ska drummer, and the drummer in a hardcore band called Slutmagnet. ""We fucking sucked, we were so bad,"" he remembers. ""But we had a great name, and we made about a hundred bucks a week in Tshirt sales."" Aggabao was a wedding singer before answering an ad and auditioning to join Rut Row. ""She sent us a demo tape and a head shot,"" Ehrbar recalls. Aggabao's bandmates have nothing butpraise for her. ""She's just good,"" Ehrbar tells me. ""We have a lot of times that the three of us just sit back and watch her work and go, 'Wow.'"" Rut Row has slowly been building a fan base at Columbia over the past year, since their first show at the West End. And for Rut Row, that's fine. ""It's all about the crowd,"" Ehrbar says. ""If they're having fun, we're having fun, because basically we're up there to be exhibitionists."" But the band wants more than that. ""We've always had really high goals since we started. Yeah, we're all in it to have a blast, and this is more fun than anything else I do, but like... "" He pauses, and Ehrbar finishes the thought for him. ""This is what we want to do for the rest of our lives."" Rut Row will play the Fed Bash this Thursday, April 12 in the Lerner Party Space with Jeffßance, MC Nuggets, and Super Lucky Cat. Bp.m., $5.For a band that shoots tequila out of squirt guns on stage, they look mighty serious."
321,"Bacchanal To Unite Students In Revelry, Sense of Community",23 April 2001,"By Katherine Isokawa Spectator Associate News EditorEuripedes might not recognize Columbia's version of the Bacchanal with its lack of frenzied packs of women, wild animals, and dismembered monarchs as in his play The Bacchae. But for those for whom Literature Humanities is just a distant memory, Bacchanal 2001 still promises entertainment. The weeklong celebration of spring, extending through April 29, kicked off last night at SoHa, where Jieun Sung, SEAS 'O3, treasurer of Special Events and Bacchanal cochair, estimated that a few hundred students were in attendance. ""I think it was very successful considering that it was a Sundaynight,"" Sung said. Other events during Bacchanal include afternoon food-eating contests, midnight games of Frisbee and dodge ball, a comedy show, a foam party, and a ""Debauchery Party."" The week concludes with a carnival held on College Walk on Saturday and the Spring Concert on Sunday. When asked to confirm that the surprise performer at the Spring Concert was Outkast, Special Events President Milan Bhatt, CC 'Ol, hesitated but eventually con-firmed the rumors. 'Traditionally it's been a surprise, but with one week to go, I guess it's all right,"" Blatt said. Bhatt emphasized that Special Events attempted to incorporate all students into planning the event.""We've really gone to all lengths to gauge what the student opinion is,"" Bhatt said, adding that the group attempted to get a consensus of what the average student would like to see and also attempted to learn from popular spring programs at other schools, such as the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. ""These are events that students would pay for, like an Outkast concert or an Andy Dick show,"" Bhatt said. ""We've tried to diversify our calendar."" Vicky Vron, CC 'Ol, secretary of Columbia Special Events, acknowledged that students were busy studying for finals but said that because of the religious holidays at the beginning of the month and the need for warm weather in order to hold many of the Bacchanal activities, the window of opportunity in which the event could be held was limited. Yet Bacchanal encompasses so many activities that most students will be able to attend at least a few of them, she said. This year's Bacchanal, said Vron,is much bigger than last year's. ""We're spending much more money on all of the events. We're having a different variety of events... We really have hyped up what Bacchanal is about,"" she said. The centerpiece of the event, agreed its organizers, was the carnival, although Bhatt cited the comedy show and concert as other highlights. Vron said the carnival would feature rides, food vendors, and tables set up by student groups selling food or promoting their groups. She estimated that 17 cultural groups would be in attendance.Bhatt called the carnival ""an opportunity for all the student groups to get together. We're really excited about that."" Bacchanal is planned entirely by Columbia Special Events and cosponsored by the Columbia College Student Council, the Engineering Student Council, the Activities Board at Columbia, the General Studies Student Council, the Chaplain's Office, Columbia Concerts, Student Development Activities, Barnard College's Student Government Association, and the University Program Board. The concluding concert is organ-ized by Columbia Concerts. The purpose of Bacchanal is ""basically to celebrate the end of the year,"" said Vron. Bhatt emphasized that a purpose of Bacchanal was to galvanize school spirit. Instead of being targeted at one ethnic or cultural group, Bacchanal caters to the entire student body. ""I think it's a way to build a school spirit or a sense of community because so many students come out and participate,"" Bhatt said. ""At this time of year before graduation, [Bacchanal is] to sort of get students excited and enthusiasticThese are events that students would pay for, like an Outkast concert or an Andy Dick show. We've tried to diversify our calendar.' —Milan Bhatt, CC 'Ol President, Special EventsWe're spending much more money on all of the events ... We really have hyped up what Bacchanal is all about.' —Bhatt"
322,Torrey Leads Physical Education Classes with Enthusiasm,14 September 2001,"By Dan Fastenberg Columbia Daily SpectatorWhile Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and Logic and Rhetoric are all well-known cornerstones of the renowned Core Curriculum, the physical education requirement is just as mandatory Most students know that all SEAS and CC undergraduates need two terms of physical education to earn their degree, and that CC students need to pass the swimming test. But most students probably do not know about the director of physical education at Columbia. The man in charge of it all is the ebullient Dr. Ken Torrey. Torrey takes a lot of pride in his department. ""I think it fits in nicely, rounds it out well,"" he said. ""While most schools dropped core curriculums in the late 19605, Columbia made the right choice to preservethe Core."" Also of note is the notorious swim requirement. Torrey defends the test, as he comments that it identifies weak swimmers and places them in swimming courses. He commented, ""It's not just a 75-yard exam. We instruct in swimming, and we do it well."" Torrey came to Columbia in 1973 as director of intramurals. ""I thought I'd be here for just a couple of years,"" Torrey said, ""but every day I come in to work with a smile, and there is no reason to stop."" Torrey came to Columbia from SUNY Cortland, where he graduated in 1971. He then stayed on as an intern teaching physical education while earning his master's degree. While Torrey headed up the intramural program, he received a doctorate in applied physiology from Teachers College. Torrey quicklyrose to the top when he became the director of the physical education department just two years into the job. Torrey grew up playing sports such as basketball, baseball, and football, and he became more involved with other sports when he arrived at Columbia. Most notable among these is Torrey's involvement with squash. He was the squash team's head coach for 14 years, as well as being the president of the Columbia Squash Association. Even 29 years into the job, Torrey can still be found teaching squash courses at Columbia. First-year Rachel Meyer said, ""While I just met Dr. Torrey in my first gym class, he is great. He makes gym so relaxed and enjoyable."" During Torrey's tenure, he has made sureto include a variety of sports, including the life sports, and he has and always will respond to student feedback. Torrey also noted the quality of his staff. Mik Aoki, Columbia's Head Baseball Coach and a member of the physical education department noted, ""Dr. Torrey is great, just tremendous. He is full of energy, positive, always searching and striving to better the department for both the students and the instructors."" Torrey is an integral member of the Columbia community. He is proud of the institution he works for, as well as being a proud Columbia parent of recent graduate Lindsay Torrey. ""I am a lucky man,"" Torrey said. ""I get to work with the world's brightest people, and they go on to great successes. Yet all the while, they come and tell me the importance of their Columbia experience.""Physical Education Director Ken Torrey leads Columbia's finest in gym."
323,New Website Serves as Textbook Marketplace,25 September 2001,"By Juliana Castedo Columbia Daily Spectator■ Founder of dogears.net hopes that site will help students save money on books.Flyers advertising the sale of used course books can be found all over the Columbia campus, but Tony Vassilev, CC 'O3, hopes soon to post ""the last used book flyer"": an advertisement for a website he created that allows Columbia and Barnard students to buy and sell used books online. If the website, www.dogears.net, is successful, Vassilev anticipates that it could ""save students a lot of money"" and provide a simpler and easier way to conduct student-to-student used book exchanges.He began creating the site last summer as an answer to the question of why ""when I buy books, they're so expensive, but when I sell them, I get nothing back."" The problem can be eliminated if students sell directly to students, Vassilev said. He added that he hoped his website will provide an alternate way for such transactions to occur. Vassilev said he didn't know anything about computers and taught himself how to program a website ""from scratch"" by using Internet tutorials and asking for advice „on online bulletin boards. To use Dogears, a student mustregister with his Columbia e-mail address and a password of his own choosing. The website then sets up an account for the student, from which he can do three things: post a book for sale, search for a book, or manage his account. Students can search for books by subject, title, or author and view listings that contain the text's condition as well as additional comments from the seller. The site offers visitors the option of requesting to buy books. ""If you see a book on the site and you want it, i|'s yours,"" Vassilevsaid, adding that unlike flyers, the website's database removes already requested books from its ""for sale"" list. Once a student requests a book, Vassilev explained, the site sends the student an e-mail asking him to confirm the sale. If the seller does not confirm the sale within two days, the website sends an e-mail to the buyer explaining that the seller is not responding. The requested book will then be removed from the database until the seller puts it back on. Until a few days ago, the CCSC also offered a website intended to help students exchange textbooks. The CCSC site consisted of bulletin boards on which one can post messages about used books, a system that Vassilev said is a virtual version of students posting flyers all over campus. The system is not searchable, and its messages stay posted even when they are no longer accurate, he said. But CCSC president Michael Novielli, CC 'O3, said that the CCSC, after consulting with Vassilev and the CCSC's webmaster, had decided to replace its textbook exchange website with Dogears. A link on the CCSC's website will lead to the newer website. ""We've received many requestsfor a better textbook exchange [service]. We feel that this new form will be much easier for studnts to use,"" Novielli said, adding that the launch of Dogears was ""rather timely"" given the e-mails that the CCSC had received requesting a new textbook exchange service. Jessica Berenyi, CC 'O3, said she has used the CCSC website to sell her books because she finds it ""ridiculous that you sell books to the bookstore for no money and buy the same books for twice what you sold them for."" She has been happy with the CCSC website but said that she would be willing to try the Dogears website. Christine Luu, CC 'O4, said she did not like the old CCSC website because she found it slow. She said she prefers selling books through flyers and plans to sell the books she is currently trying to sell to the bookstore if no one responds to her flyers. Luu, however, added that she would consider using Dogears if she knew other people used it. As for publicity, at the beginning of the semester Vassilev hoped to attract users to Dogears through advertising. Computer problems delayed the finishing of his website until now. However, Vassilev said that beginning to advertise the websitein the middle of the semester, when most students have already sold or purchased their books, is better as he ""would prefer to have small usage"" initially. ""I'm optimistic about it,"" Vassilev said, ""but I have the feeling of releasing a caged animal."" Concerned that minimal usage would discourage potential early users, Vassilev purchased Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization books to post initially. ""I'm not selling them for profit,"" he said, adding that he posted these books for the same price he paid for them and had posted them ""just so something was there."" In the future, Vassilev said, he doesn't want to put advertisements on Dogears. While Vassilev said he has considered making money with the website, he insisted that such profit would never involve ""making money from students."" Vassilev has also considered taking the website to other college campuses or developing the site into a marketplace for students to buy and sell any items, not just textbooks. He has not discounted the idea of a publicity stunt, either, as he mentioned the possibility of ""doing something crazy ... to attract attention on campus"" and let students know about the website."
324,Professors Anastassiou Seidel Receive Awards,12 October 2001,"By Kristian Hansen Columbia Daily Spectator■ 52nd annual Great Teacher Awards honor Professors Anastassiou, Seidel in Low Library ceremony last night.Two days after Columbia received its fifth Nobel Prize in the past six years, the Society of Columbia Graduates paid tribute to the teaching achievements of Columbia professors in Low Library last night.The 52nd annual Great Teacher Awards were bestowed on Dimitris Anastassiou, professor of Electrical Engineering, and Michael Seidel, the Jesse and George Siegel Professor of the Humanities, at the '92 nd annual meeting of the Society for Columbia Graduates for the professors' dedication to their students both inside and outside of the classroom. The society is an organization composed of graduates of Columbia's undergraduate schools who have given at least 10 consecutive years of service to the University as alumni. Highlighting the importance of teachers as the ""lifeline of a great college,"" Gerald Sherwin, CC '55, president of the Alumni Association, said that students with the help of exceptional professors will be able to ""reach the highest levels of their [educational] capabilities.""This year's recipients were introduced by the deans of their respective colleges. ""Your passion for your subject matter excites [students] and inspires them,"" said Zvi Galil, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science dean, of the professors. ""At the same time theyare touched by your care for them as individuals."" Speaking before the dinner, Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley lauded the two professors for their excellence in teaching. ""The greatest importance of these two individuals is how they are able to excite students to pursue education to a higher level,"" he said. Quigley said the awards ""allow for professors to feel honored by not only their peers but by their students."" Recognizing Seidel specifically, Quigley called the professor a ""vital link in the teaching community"" and noted that Seidel teaches students from all of the undergraduate classes. Seidel teaches Literature Humanities and specializes in the works of James Joyce.In acceptance of his award, Seidel said he felt reassured that he must be ""doing something right,"" and noted that ""it has always been a real pleasure to connect with the student body."" Saying that he is perpetually learning from his students how to be a better teacher, Seidel concluded that ""You cannot be a great teacher without great students."" Anastassiou echoed Seidel's words in his speech and referred to the quality of Columbia students, saying that ""the students are the ones who make the courses work so well."" Anastassiou recently pioneered a new course at Columbia, Introduction to Genomic Information Science and Technology, that combines aspects of engineering and biology and, in its second year, attracts students from all levels of the sciences. He closed the evening with a lecture on the importance of interdisciplinary studies and said, ""the future of the job industry is one that combines aspects of various disciplines.""They are able to excite students to pursue education to a higher level.' —Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley'At the same time [the students] are touched by your care for them as individuals.' —Engineering and Applied Science School Dean Zvi Galil'You cannot be a great teacher without great students.' —Award Recipient Professor Michael Seidel"
325,Everyone Says We Love You: Columbia Musical Theater Society Salutes Woody Allen,24 October 2001,"By Vera A. Trofimenko Columbia Daily SpectatorWoody Allen was once overheard saying, ""If my film makes one more person miserable, I'll feel I've done my job."" But when Aarthi Vadde, CC 'O2, decided to make A Tribute to Woody Allen the fall project of the ColumbiaMusical Theater Society, she had quite a different motive. ""Living in New York City, Woody Allen's creations are particularly funny and pertinent,"" said Vadde, who is the producer of A Tribute to Woody Allen and the director of Allen's play God, playing Oct. 2528. The object of this production is to make the audience laugh, to make them think,and —most importantly—to make them nod in understanding. Vadde believes that Woody Allen's work has an academic, intellectual air that makes a showcase of his work appropriate in a college setting. The miniature festival of Woody Allen's work entails a production consisting of the one-act play God, the sketch ""The Whore of Mensa,"" monologues from If Impressionists Were Dentists, and scenes from Allen's films Annie Hall, Husbands and Wives, and Everyone Says I Love You. These acts have been rehearsed, reworked, and refined since mid-September, under the direction of Cory Garfin, GS 'O5, Miranda Halverson, CC 'O2, Andy Hao, CC 'O5, Yuma Terada, CC 'O5, Heidi Wexler, GS 'O5, and Vadde. The play God, starring Ben Kopit, CC 'O2, as the actor Diabetes, Matt Hamm as the playwright Hepatitis, and Claire Snyder, CC 'O2, as the bombshell Doris Levine, certainly calls out to the veterans of Literature Humanities. Hepatitis, the desperate, Homeresque play-wright, has no ending for his play, which is about to open at the Athenian Drama Festival. ""[What] if the Trojan army surrendered ... if Agamemnon reneged on his promise?"" Hamm, as Hepatitis, asks. Hamm himself is just as lost and unsure about a resolution. Soon, worrisome philosophical questions arise in the minds of the two dissatisfied men. ""It's bizarre, isn't it,"" Kopit, as Diabetes, replies.As the idiosyncratic and allegorical story unfolds, more insecurity, ambiguity, and irony appear in Hamm's character. ""We're two ancient Greeks in Athens and we're about tosee a play I wrote and you're acting in, and they're from Queens or some terrible place like that and they're watching us in someone else's play. What if they're characters in another play? And someone's watching them? Or what if nothing exists and we're all in somebody's dream? Or, what's worse, what if only that fat guy in the third row exists?"" But the references to classics and the philosophical questions form only part of the appeal of Allen's play What is also attractive about God and the other pieces is that they will be seen in a live performance. Snyder, who also plays Annie Hall, spoke of A Tribute to Woody Allen as ""an opportunity for the audience to experience the improvisational quality of Woody Allen's work."" The familiar and loved deliberateness of Allen's films has the potential to be amplified tenfold in a theatrical setting. A Tribute To Woody Allen runs from Oct. 25 through Oct. 28 at the Lemer Black Box Theater.'lf my film makes one more person miserable, I'll feel Pve done my job' —Woody AllenThe play God ... certainly calls out to the veterans of Literature Humanities. Hepatitis, the desperate, Homeresque playwright, has no ending for his play.'"
326,Students Start Planning Dance Marathon,30 October 2001,"By Amba Datta And Katherine Isokawa Columbia Daily SpectatorColumbia has a marathon runner for its next president, and Columbia College students regularly exercise their endurance through two-hour Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization classes. And just as they did last year, Columbia students will come together to test their stamina in a 28-hour dance marathon. The second annual Columbia Dance Marathon will take place in Roone Arledge Auditorium on Feb. 9-10,2002. The proceeds will benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The first dancer registration is tonight at 9 p.m. in the Kraft Center, with additional dancer registration periods to follow on Nov. 13 and Dec. 7. Each dancer pays a $3O registration fee and must raise an addi-tional $5OO through sponsorships. During the dance marathon, different groups will provide entertainment for each hour, said Dance Marathon Chair Will Hunter, CC 'O2. For example, he said, last year Club Zamana provided an hour of Indian pop, and fraternities and sororities threw a carnival at the end of the 28 hours. This year, Hunter said he anticipated working with Orchesis to have dancers instruct the dancers. Among the fundraising strategies thus far is ""canning,"" when dancers and other volunteers bring cans marked with the Dance Marathon insignia to concerts in order to request change. The group raised $3OO in 40 minutes at Sunday's U2 concert at the Meadowlands. At another event, Hunter said, the group raised $1,700 through canning.""People who you would stereotypically expect never to care about something like this will give you $2O. It's really a beautiful thing, as cheesy as that sounds,"" Fundraising Committee co-chair Katie Romansky, CC 'O3, said. Romansky raised over $8,400 last year through a variety of methods, including letterwriting and canning, and will run a clinic to provide dancers with her fundraising tips. ""[Fundraising] makes the experience so much more powerful and so much more important. It's just the most motivating thing in the world to see,"" Romansky said.The emphasis of this year's Dance Marathon is on raising more money than last year, as well as on strengthening the connection between dancers and the children with HIV and AIDS for whom they are raising money, Hunter said. Dancers will volunteer with these children and at local hospitals, he said. 'They're not just raising money for some ephemeral program, but they're understanding where this money is going and who they're helping out,"" Hunter said. In addition to serving a humanitarian goal, this year's Dance Marathon will ""be the biggest party that Columbia has ever seen,"" said Kate Thursby, CC 'O3, public relations chair for Dance Marathon 2002. Both Thursby and Hunter promised a bigger and better marathon than last year's, which raised $105,000, a record amount for a first-year dance marathon. ""We did amazingly well for a first-year dance marathon,"" Romansky said. Hunter said the Dance Marathon, which drew 110 dancers last year, hoped to gather 150 dancers this year and break the record for second-year dance marathons. Like last year's event, this year's Dance Marathon hopes to draw a variety of celebrities. Among those Hunter named were Sex and the City's Cynthia Nixon, BC 'BB, Miss America 1998 Kate Shindle, and actress Kimberly Williams. As for the dancers themselves, Hunter said he hoped to have each residence hall floor, student group, fraternity or sorority sponsor one or two dancers, both financially and as moralers. Moralers join the dancers on the dance floor in shifts to provide support and energy for the dancers. The event is coordinated by a 25-person steering committee of students representing across-section of Columbia undergraduates from Columbia College, Barnard College, General Studies, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science. The committee's adviser is Kyle Pendleton, coordinator of Greek Affairs. ""They've been very helpful,"" Hunter said of the Greek groups. ""They've had some of the most supported dancers in terms of moraling and raising money."" However, Hunter emphasized that the event was ""not just a Greek thing. It's reallytaken over —it's gone throughout campus."" Thursby also emphasized that the Dance Marathon was intended to appeal to a variety of dancers and that community members and graduate students were also encouraged to dance. ""We're trying to make it a University and community-wide event,"" Thursby said. ""If we could have more events that could bring the two together and help foster a relationship between the two, that would be positive.""'[lt's] not just a Greek thing. It's really taken over—it's gone throughout campus.' —Dance Marathon Chair Will Hunter, CC 'O2At Columbia's first dance marathon in February, students stayed on their feet for 28 hours raising funds to fight pediatric AIDS.The first annual Dance Marathon was held last February. Dancers, joined by various clubs, friends, and celebrities, spent 28 hours in Roone Arledge Auditorium."
327,Students Don't Give Thanks for Wed. Class,31 October 2001,"By Juliana Castedo Columbia Daily Spectator■ Students who want to travel home choose between school or family on the day before Thanksgiving.This Thanksgiving, Austin Frank CC 'O4, will spend almost as much time traveling as he will with his family and friends. ""I'm flying home to Cleveland Wednesday night which only gives me the day of Thanksgiving at home. Then I'm traveling that weekend to see my grandparents and friends in Michigan. The extra day would have given me some more time to visit with people. This way it feels rushed instead of like a holiday."" Frank's sentiments are not unusual. The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is neither a holiday nor a shortened day at Columbia. Some students do not go home at all because of the short length of this break. Of those students returning home, many will have to skip classes on the Wednesday preceding the holiday or, like Frank, accept shortened trips home. Tanya Franklin, CC 'O5, is not returning to her home in Los— — 0 0 . Angeles but said that if she ""had gotten Wednesday off officially, [she] would have flown all the way home Tuesday night and spent five days there."" ""I think that [Columbia] should make the Wednesday before or the Monday after Thanksgiving our fall break, instead of the Election Day weekend,"" said Franklin, ""because that would give us a real opportunity to make it home. Then I could see my family, who I haven't seen since August."" Marissa Desmond, CC 'O5, is going home, but she is missing her 6:10 p.m. Literature Humanities class on Wednesday to do so. With her five-hour train ride home to Boston, attending the class would mean arriving home no earlier than 2 a.m. When asked if the University had ever considered beginning the break on the day before Thanksgiving, Virgil Renzulli, Associate Vice President for PublicAffairs, said he didn't think anyone had proposed the idea. He attributed the current schedule to the need to ""draw the line somewhere"" and asked why, if the University cancelled classes on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, it shouldn't also cancel classes on Monday and Tuesday. Renzulli also addressed a possible need for a longer break this year as a consequence of the Sept. 11 attacks. He responded to this possibility by expressing confidence that most transportation is ""back to normal."" Renzulli stressed that ""it's not a trivial thing to take a day off the schedule at the last minute,"" mentioning that ""faculty plan things,"" such as guest lectures or exams, for non-holidays. He suggested that altering the schedule to accommodate long travels home would possibly disrupt such plans. But this year as with any other, Renzulli said, students can make their own decisions about when the Thanksgiving break begins; although the University does not cancel any classes on Wednesday, Renzulli acknowledged that manystudents leave early, missing class. He suggested that a Thanksgiving break beginning on Wednesday would be unnecessary and used the breaks of other institutions as examples. Renzulli stated that other colleges and universities don't have Wednesday off and ""many places in the commercial world don't have the Friday [following Thanksgiving] off."" Several of Columbia's peer schools, however, do have a shortened day the day before Thanksgiving. Brown University ends classes at noon on the day before Thanksgiving, Dartmouth College begins its break at 12:20 p.m. on the same day, and Cornell University's break begins at 1:10 p.m. The University of Virginia does not hold any classes on Wednesday. According to Sharon Greene, Dartmouth's Assistant to the Board of Trustees, the college's shortened Wednesday schedule just before Thanksgiving break has been part of the schedule for years and is ""probably a matter of travel convenience."""
328,In Our Pages 20 Years Ago,1 November 2001,"The following articles appeared in the Columbia Daily Spectator during the week of Oct. 26, 1981. Lit Hum and CC for Barnard? The heads of the Contemporary Civilization and the Literature Humanities programs (before they were integrated under the Core Office) disagreed at a forum overwhether expanding those programs to include Barnard students would dilute the quality of the teaching staff. Jacob Smit, director of the Contemporary Civilization program, blasted the coeducation plan being negotiated between Columbia and Barnard —which would make CC and the Humanities classes required courses at Barnard —because such an expansion would force the schools to hire unqualified instructors. Finding qualified teachers is already difficult, Smit explained. But Paul Valliere, professor of religion and director of the Literature Humanities program, said staffing the new sections would not be difficult and claimed the negotiated settlement was the best alternative to solve the coeducation woes of the College because it would ultimately increase the level of cooperation between the two schools. Much of the discussion centered on the practically of expanding the core curriculum. Smit said 26 Barnard faculty members would be needed to teach the new CC sections that would have to be offered to accommodate Barnard students. Professors in the departments from which those professors would be drawn ""will have to give up 50 percent of their courses,"" thereby diminishing Barnard's curriculum in those departments. Politics and the Revival of Tenure's Popularity Many professors predicted that the progressives'search for alternatives to tenure would lose steam. They said the complaints and the interest in reforms would fade if the U.S. experienced a recurrence of what Professor James Mirollo called ""McCarthy-type pressures."" Such an atmosphere, many professors believed, would generate a renewed appreciation for tenure's his-torical role as a guardian of academic freedom —a function they said gets overlooked during economic slumps, when tenure is seem simply as job security. ""I expect that any increase in repressiveness in the U.S. to bring people back to a more positive affection for the tenure system,"" said Professor Walter Metzger, a scholar of academic tenure. ""Let something happen at Columbia —a cause celebre —and you'll find a different tone,"" he claimed. ""It's like a fish out of water —the fish doesn't appreciate the water until it's out of the bowl."" Metzger added that many tenure critics forget the process is a designated to protect professors from administrative constraints within the university, as well as from ideological pressures outside the institution. ""People think academic freedom should protect a Freud or a Solzhenitsyn,"" Metzger said. ""But since there are very few Freuds and Solzhenitsyns, they forget that being able to take a position that offends a dean or a trustee is academic freedom, too."" Critics of tenure claimed the bottleneck in tenured openings hurt morale among junior faculty members and dissuaded talented scholars from going into academia. No specific suggestion for remodeling tenure had surfaced at Columbia —even though most professors interviewed said the system neede modifications if Columbia wanted to attract and keep top-notch instructors."
329,Computer Screen to Silver Screen Student Filmmaker Completes New Work,2 November 2001,"Student Filmmaker Completes New WorkBy Ben Kenigsberg Spectator Staff WriterDavid Elson, SEAS 'O2, is majoring in computer science but wants to be a filmmaker. ""I will be a director,"" Elson said, ""but the computer science degree will help me get started."" Elson has already started his work as a filmmaker. He is the creator —writer, director, music composer, and editor—of the Columbia Television show Lion Tales, which first aired on Nov. 16, 1998. Since then, Lion Tales received three Engie Awards—CTV's version of the Emmys—for Best New Show, Show of the Year, and Best Editing. ""I wanted to make a show that •> would let me develop my filmmaking skill and still give it some local color,"" Elson said. ""Each episode represents a different film style that I'd like to try. They range from fan-tasy-mystery to parody to experimental. Each episode of Lion Tales has gotten more and more complex."" Four episodes have aired already. The fifth, 'The Signal Game,"" will premiere on Nov. 26. The sixth and final episode, ""Getting Jessica,"" will start filming next spring and will air in the fall. Each episode is approximately one half-hour long. ""Tunnel Vision,"" the firstepisode, is about a Columbia sophomore ""haunted by visions of the University's underground tunnel system,"" according to the Lion Tales web site. The second film, ""Not-So-Real World,"" is a spoof of the MTV show, The Real World. ""The Mind's Eye"" is a thriller ""best seen with as little foreknowledge as possible."" Last year's ""Doppelgangers"" tells the story of a student who is transported to an alternate reality in which Columbia is everything that admissions informational pamphlet promised it would be. ""The Signal Game,"" Elson's latest work, is about a girl with a crush and her imaginary friends. ""They all involve Columbia and its students, and they all have a scene in the underground tunnel system,"" Elson said. ""I think that staying local in my subject matter gives Lion Tales an authenticity that I wouldn't have by making standard dramas."" Many of the actors and crew members are Columbia students. Elson used floormates from his first year to help him make the first episode. ""The first two shows had premieres where everyone got dressed up and rolled out a paper red carpet for the actors,"" Elson said. ""Now I hold auditions and recruit [non-pro-fessional] crew members from out-side Columbia, but I still tend to use my floormates in a pinch."" Rus Korets, CC 'O2, has worked for Elson both as an actor and a crew member. ""On one scene,"" Korets said, ""I had to lie on the floor of the John Jay laundry room, so I wouldn't be in the shot, holding up a mike. It was all good fun. When you see it all put together, it's an experience."" Elson hires actors with varying degrees of experience. ""The only acting experience I had was the typ-ical high-school play business, nothing real,"" said Karen Ruttner, BC 'O3, who acted in ""The Signal Game."" Sheena Fallon, BC 'O4, who also appeared in ""The Signal Game,"" had only acted in high school and had worked on tech for the theater department at Barnard. Also in ""The Signal Game"" was Eve Armstrong, CC 'O2, who has acted in two other films and who has performed and sung on stage for 10 years. Elson, his crew, and his performers often have difficulty finding time to make the shows. 'Time management can be very difficult, and I burned out last semester,"" Elson said. ""The time commitment was obscene,"" Ruttner said. ""A lot of my time last year was spent going to rehearsals and shoots for The Signal Game.' The first shoot we ever did lasted until 5 a.m. It was pretty rough."" Korets said the time commitment depended on one's responsibilities on the film. ""We shot episode three during finals week,"" he added. ""Since we did it in one day, it was doable."" For ""Doppelgangers,"" Elson recruited Mellon Professor of the Humanities Karl Kroeber as an actor. Kroeber, who received a script to work from, played aLiterature Humanities professor. ""I didn't know David before he talked me into doing the part,"" Kroeber said. ""I was vulnerable because I was at that time giving a course. I hope to get back to one of these days on film adaptations."" Although ""Doppelgangers"" poked fun at academia, Kroeber was pleased to be in the film. ""I enjoyed the portrayal of Lit Hum, which is a fine course that I've taught many times over the years, beginning in 1954, but which is, around here, treated with such pious pomposity that a light-hearted spoof of it is wonderfully refreshing."" The campus feedback that Elson has received for Lion Tales has been favorable. Many of the actors, Elson said, are identified and stopped in the streets. While Lion Tales has been very rewarding work for Elson, he didn't do it alone. ""Lion Tales couldn't have happened without the very dedicated work of many of my friends, and I think it's important to give them a lot of credit,"" Elson said. ""The Signal Game"" premieres on Nov. 26 in Lerner Hall Cinema. Other Lion Tales movies can be viewed at http://www.

330,Proposed Policy Changes Seen as Largely Positive,9 November 2001,"By Holly Miller Spectator Staff Writer■ Students approve of proposed academic disciplinary changes but know little about them or current policy.As a committee of Columbia College students and administrators begins to review the College's existing academic discipline policies, many students are unaware that changes to current University policy are under discussion. Furthermore, while many students said they supported the idea of increased student involvement in the University's academic infractions policy in theory, few students were aware of the specifics of current Columbia policy. A new plan being considered by the Columbia College Student Council and University deans, calls for the creation of a committee of three students and four faculty members or administrators to hear a case brought against a student. In the current policy, an administrator hears the case. ""I know there is some student society, some student judges, that if it goes up that high they decide on it,"" Ruven Ellberger, CC 'O5, said, inadvertently describing the proposed changes. He is not the only one who's slightly confused. When questioned, many undergraduates seemed largely unfamiliar with the provisions of existing University policy. One of the main goals of the proposed changes is to address this very lack of awareness about the University's policies on academic infractions. ""Academic dishonesty is not really discussed right now, and one of the goals of our proposal is to raise awareness of it,"" CCSC President Michael Novielli, CC 'O3, said. ""Students need to know what academic dishonesty is and what the punishments are for offenses committed."" Novielli went on to say, ""Students cannot be blamed if they are not familial - with the intricacies of the Dean's Discipline process."" Dean's Discipline, a component of Columbia policy for over forty years, is used in cases of University student infractions, except for cases of sexual misconduct. Under the current policy, after a student's academic integrity is questioned he or she is referred to a dean in theappropriate school or college. The dean determines an initial punishment and hears all appeals. Sophomore Class Vice President Rohit Dixit, with the help of other student council members and several deans, researched and formulated the proposed changes to Dean's Discipline over the past year. Dixit said he believes Columbia's past attempts to educate undergraduates on academic policy have fallen short and believes that increased student awareness about the proposal will generate support. ""An initiative like this proposal must come from the students and be accepted by the students,"" Dixit said. ""The students do not have a clear idea as to what is going on now,"" said Kathleen McDermott, associate dean of Academic Affairs. ""I would really like to have a pamphlet to give out to students at Orientation."" McDermott also said the University has several procedures currently in place to educate the undergraduates. ""We do talk about academic honesty [and academic discipline] during our group advising sessions. Literature Humanities and also Contemporary Civilizations have a written statement about academic honesty and dishonesty that they ask students to read and sign, as well as Logic and Rhetoric. The policy is also in the bulletin and, I believe, FACETS, but it is clear that we need to do more, perhaps not so much about the policy, but about [increasing awareness of] the procedures for a disciplinary hearing."" While a few students indicated some notion of Dean's Discipline, most acknowledged the presence of a policy from a piece of paper they vaguely remembered signing in the first week of Literature Humanities. When asked if he read what he signed, Paul Burkey, CC 'O5, echoed the words of many: ""Not very closely."" Many students who were previously unaware of the proposed changes, received them positively when told of their existence by a reporter. ""Going before one person isn'treally fair, because it's only one person hearing your story,"" Jennifer Legum, CC 'O5, said. ""I think students who would be on the student-run [disciplinary committee] would be very responsible,"" Ellberger said. He said he believes students would listen fairly to their peers. Others students said they saw the suggested policy as irrelevant and impractical. ""I don't have much of a feeling because cheating is not really an option. It seems like it might be more of an issue if people were cheating,"" said Peter Ottomanelli, SEAS 'O3. Should the proposal become a real possibility, the CCSC will hold forums to inform students and to encourage their input. Oliver Zill, CC 'O2, said he believes these forums would serve to incorporate students into the governing process. 'There are student [representatives] on the Senate andSexual Misconduct, although people say students don't get anything accomplished there, so I think this would be a good way to get students involved,"" Zill said. Though they anticipate the expected low response rate, the leaders of the campaign are not disheartened. McDermott said that future policy will reflect student wishes no matter what shape it takes but also expressed a desire for students to use this opportunity to their benefit. ""Personally, I would like to see student involvement in the disciplinary process, but it has to be something that students believe in and want to happen,"" she said. ""Most importantly, though, a student voice needs to be added to the discipline process.""'The students do not have a clear idea as to what is going on now. It is clear we need to do more, perhaps, not so much about the policy, but about [increasing awareness] of the policy.' —Dean Kathleen McDermott"
331,"Profs Eden, Johnston Honored for Service to Core",28 November 2001,"By James Romser Spectator Staff Writer■ Kathy Eden and David Johnston recognized for innovations in teaching Core Curriculum classes yesterday.An award ceremony held yesterday for two professors of Core Curriculum classes provided a forum for commendation as well as reflection on the importance of the Core Curriculum in the Columbia College education. Kathy Eden and David Johnston were jointly given the Ninth Annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum. Speakers who introduced Eden and Johnston praised them as teachers and noted their influence in shaping the Core Curriculum. Dr. Mohe Gold, who was once a student of Eden's, compared his former professor to Diotima, a pedagogical character in Plato's Symposium. Professor Cathy Popkin, speaking in honor of Johnston, noted that ""his efforts in reinventing the Core Curriculum were Herculean,"" especially in connection with Contemporary Civilization.Johnston trained preceptors, increased the quality of the faculty, and ""moved writing to the center"" of the course, Popkin said. Other speakers provided more general commentary on the state of the Core Curriculum. All identified the Core as a unique and crucial aspect of the Columbia College experience and emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards of instruction within the Core. In his opening remarks, Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley called the Core Curriculum ""a renewal rather than a replication of traditions,"" adding that it takes great teachers to facilitate meaningful discourse in the classroom. William Theodore de Bary, John Mitchell Mason Professor Emeritus, Provost Emeritus, and Special Service Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures, serving as the master of ceremonies, focused on attracting great teachers in the Core Curriculum. 'The method is just as important as the material,"" he said. ""General education is an endan-gered species,"" de Bary added. ""We pay special tribute to those who have been leaders in the Core Curriculum."" David Cohen, vice president for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said the Core is ""the very signature of undergraduate education at Columbia"" and identified the faculty as responsible for ""sustaining the vitality of the Core Curriculum."" Cohen also emphasized the importance of incorporating science-related courses into the core. ""Students are no longer attentive only to ourselves. We are awakened to our own humanity,"" Gold said. After she received her award, Eden, the Mark Van Doren Professor of Humanities and thechair of Literature Humanities, also lauded the Core. ""A core curriculum enriches the intellectual and social life of the students,"" she said. ""Core teaching is, in my view and in my experience, a unique educational undertaking,"" Eden added. Speaking briefly, Johnston, a professor of political science and the Nell and Herbert M. Singer Professor of Contemporary Civilization, thanked fellow award recipient Eden and several other colleagues who had helped him during his career. While the ceremony's speakers offered broad reflection on the Core Curriculum, the focus of the event remained on Eden and Johnston. Each honoree was introduced by a pair of speeches, one given by a col-league and one by a former student. At the end of the ceremony, University President George Rupp made an unannounced appearance. Rupp used the word ""crucial"" to describe Eden's and Johnston's ""commitment to undergraduate education in general and the Core in particular."" In her introduction for Johnston, Lauren Winner, Johnston's former student and a current student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, encapsulated the sentiments of all the afternoon's speakers. ""The Core Curriculum provides all Columbia College graduates with a common basis of knowledge,"" Winner said.'[Johnston's] efforts in reinventing the Core Curriculum were Herculean.' —Professor Cathy PopkinIn the ceremony for the presentation of the ninth annual Award for Distinguished Service in the Core, Professors Kathy Eden and David Johnston were lauded by faculty and former students."
332,Core Professor Gray Inspired Students,29 January 2002,"By Amba Datta Spectator Senior Staff Writer■ Remembered for his dedication to teaching, Gray taught at CU for over forty years.As a young professor in Columbia's Department of English and Comparative Literature, Wallace Gray could never walkacross the Columbia campus in less than 25 minutes because his students always stopped to talk to him. When student protesters tookover Hamilton Hall in 1968, all classes were stopped from meeting except for Gray's because his students threw his books down to him so he could teach on the lawn. And his Eliot, Joyce, and Pound course was always packed full because his students were inspired by his love for the literature that moved him. In a time when professors have been said to focus their academic life to publishing, Professor Emeritus of English and Comparative Literature and SeniorScholar Wallace Gray dedicated himself to his students, making his teaching the focal point of a tenure at Columbia College that spanned over four decades. He died of a heart attack on Dec. 21 at the age of 74, leaving behind generations of former students and colleagues who were touched by his love of great books. ""He was a great mind, a wry wit, and the best teacher I've ever had or can ever hope to have,"" said Max Mayer-Cesiano, CC 'O3, a student in Gray's Literature Humanities class two years ago. ""Despite his sarcastic jokes about indoctrinating us into his world of Aristotelian ethics and modernist perspectives, what he managed to do in his class was to show many hundreds of students fresh out of high school, one small group at a time, how sophisticated a true scholar's view of the world can be."" Gray sparked an appreciation in his students for writers as diverse as James Joyce, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Flannery O'Connor. He gavehis time generously to his students and left many of them with vivid memories of his intellectual vigor coupled with his engaging dry humor and gracious manner. He left behind a legacy not of published volumes but of hundreds of Columbia College students who saw reflected through his human approach the great literature lessons they have since carried with them through life. ""For me, he defined what Columbia was about... the teaching process never stopped with him ... [and] the teaching never stopped after I left the school,"" said author Anthony Rudel, CC '79, a former Gray student, who became his close friend and relied on Gray as an editor for his own work. Gray took pride in being a teacher that challenged students with his perfectionist's eye, and he did so for decades, both in the classroom and outside, sitting on the steps of Low Library and over cof-fee in neighborhood coffee shops and diners with his students. Born in 1927 and raised in Alexandria, La., Gray attended Louisiana College. A pacifist, Gray volunteered for a medical unit in the U.S. Navy from 1944 to 1946 to avoid the Army draft. Gray's love of the cultural opportunities of New York was coupled with a hint of a Southern accent that betrayed his origins. His connection to the South expressed itself characteristically through a love for Southern writers including William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. During the Civil Rights movement, that connection also led him on trips from Louisiana to Mississippi with students to recruit African American voters. After receiving his M.A. from Louisiana State University, Gray came to New York City, began teaching at Columbia College in 1953, and received his Ph.D. in 1958 after studying under Columbia greats Lionel Trilling and Mark van Doren. Gray's philosophy on teaching was shaped by the legendary van Doren, and in 1975 Gray received the award in van Doren's name awarded by the students of Columbia College for excellent teaching. Gray believed, like van Doren, that a great teacher should be able to disappear at the end of a class, leaving students with the capability to connect with the texts on their own. ""When I began teaching, Mark van Doren advised me that 'teachers should be forgotten,""' Gray wrote in his book of essays on great literature, From Homer to Joyce. Gray's teaching career at Columbia never ended. He made the University his academic home for life, eventually becoming a Professor Emeritus and a SeniorScholar at Columbia. And all the while he never lost his passion for reaching students, continually worrying about his effectiveness as a teacher. ""It's a great tribute to him that he worried about it ... changing your practice is not a trivial thing,"" former student Roger Blumberg, CC 'B3, said. His courses evolved over decades and included the famous Eliot, Joyce, and Pound class and Literature Humanities, a course he taught for longer than any other professor at Columbia. An expert on James Joyce, Gray also taught courses on American drama, poetry, and oral interpretations of literature. Gray actively encouraged campus theater productions, which reflected a long-standing theatrical interest of his that stretched back to his high school years. Gray's younger brother, Aubrey T. Gray, remembered his role in high school as Petruchio in Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew best: ""He delivered an actual heavy-duty kiss to the Shrew at the prescribed time, instead of a 'stage kiss,' and she was pretty perturbed as she stormed off the set,"" he said. Gray wrote over a dozen plays, including an off-Broadway play entitled Helen, which opened in 1964, and a children's musical entitled The Cowboy and the Tiger. His most notable published scholarly work was From Homer to Joyce. ""You can hear his voice in that book,"" Professor Emeritus of Russian Robert Belknap said, ""unassuming, funny, and aware of all complexities."" Students remembered that voice well, recalling what Blumberg called Gray's capacity for being ""ironically bravado,"" making statements that sounded arrogant but were belied by his modesty and love of the give and take of an intellectu-al discussion. Those intellectual conversations were also central to his relationships with colleagues on the Columbia faculty. Although Gray served for a few years as assistant dean of the College beginning in 1967, he was a private person who steered clear of academic politics and forged his connections to professors through the books he taught. ""He was one of the people who concealed his hard work and his strong intellect ... The thing he made no effort to conceal was his warmth and friendliness,"" Belknap said. ""He loved the excitement of suddenly understanding something, and he worked to share that excitement with his students and his fellow teachers."" Senior Scholar James Mirollo recalled always running into Gray on street corners on Broadway and discussing books. ""We stood there like idiots in the freezing cold ... talking about Lit Hum ... it was central to his life,"" Mirollo chuckled. In the Literature Humanities class that was so important to him, Gray often searched through works for what his favorite writer Joyce described in Ulvsses as ""the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature,"" and he combined an emotional sensitivity with what he called his ""self-mocking, cynical humor."" He was the kind of man who was arrested by moments of beauty in life that moved him. In her comments at the ceremony for the Distinguished Service to the Core medal, which Gray received in 1997, Adjunct Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature and Director of the Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly shared an e-mail message that he wrote to her one morning. He wrote: ""Saw a beautiful sight on College Walk a few weeks ago—a boy walking with his mother with his arms around"
333,Remembering Gray,29 January 2002,"In The Course of Human Events By Ben FishmanGreat teachers punctuate a student's education by inspiring moments of revelation and transforming learning into an insatiable appetite for knowledge and understanding. Professor Wallace Gray was such an exceptional teacher. He devoted his life to bringing out the best in the hundreds of students who were fortunate enough to attend his classes for the more than 40 years he taught at Columbia. Taking Literature Humanities with such a wise, gracious, demanding, and inspiring man will forever remain one of my education's formative experiences, and Wallace Gray will always be one of Columbia's most formidable teachers. Although generations of students passed through his classes, debating with him on the same texts, Professor Gray never stopped teaching. After retiring in 1994, he continued instructing Lit Hum as a Senior Scholar because the classroom was his lifeblood. Without students, the classic works he loved so passionately could not resonate with the voices of young readers discovering the words of Homer, Aristotle, Dostoevsky, and Joyce. While he grew physically weak and had less energy for work, Gray did not end his beloved career and planned to teach again in the fall term. As Professor Eileen Gillooly, Director of the Core Curriculum, observed, ""He could not live without teaching."" Gray confirmed this obsession to our class with one of his typically honest, self-mocking quips. While trying to wipe chalk on his pants and only spreading the stain, he turned to us and chuckled, ""When I die, I want to have a piece of chalk in my hands."" There was a purpose to Gray's teaching. As he said so many times, ""Books talk to books,"" and he aimed to engage students in the ongoing dialogue between great authors. To Gray, literature is a conversation between writers reacting to the same thoughts and emotions using different words and different stories. What Gray never told us, but what became obvious from his class, is that the voices of texts spark an even more vibrant conversation between teachers and students. Books are not written for their own sake, but to be analyzed and critiqued, to be wrestled with until readers come away with a different understanding about themselves and the world. It is within this tradition of learning where Wallace Gray found himself most at home. Part of Professor Gray's identity as a teacher included his love for Columbia and its students whose ""rugged intellectuality and defiant independence"" motivated his loyalty to the school. He often spoke fondly about studying under Columbia legends Mark Van Doren, Lionel Trilling, and William York Tindall. He told us about reading Tindall's smuggled copy of Ulysses when it was chained to the reserve desk in Low Library and of the glory days of John Jay Dining Hall when professors and students sattogether to extend classroom conversations and tackle topics beyond the syllabus. Perhaps most telling was his description of the campus turmoil in 1968, when as assistant dean of Columbia College with an office in Hamilton Hall, his students inside the blockaded building threw down his books from the window. Even when the rest of the school shut down, Gray continued to hold his class on the lawn. Professor Gray taught different lessons to different students, but all appreciated his extraordinary ability, his connection to literature, and his passionate commitment to teaching. Anthony Rudel, CC '79, remembered Gray extending class discussions to his office, to coffee shops, and to the Low steps, never ceasing to talk with students about books or life. George Stephanopoulos, CC 'B2, said that Gray 'Taught me how to read, how to get inside a text."" He recalled Gray crying in front of the 300 students who attended his popular Eliot, Joyce, and Pound Lecture when reading aloud the closing lines of Ulysses. And Steven Kaplan, CC '74, remembered how Gray always encouraged students to approach a text creatively, and look for art in unexpected places. Remaining fresh in students' minds long after teaching them is the sign of a truly influential professor, and memories of Wallace Gray are still vivid to so many of his students. It is unfortunate that word of Gray's death came from an obituary in The New York Times, not through the Columbia community. Granted, Professor Gray died at the beginning of winter break, an inopportune time for administrative action. But his devotion to the school and his dedication to its students merit extra effort on behalf of his memory. Surely the passing of such a Columbia icon should be noted on the front page of the Columbia website ahead of some professor's observation of a trend in an obscure issue. The University should recognize Gray's legacy and exceptional contribution to Columbia College by creating an award for excellence in teaching or a prize for an outstanding student. To me and to so many of his former students, Gray's death leaves an emptiness in our lives; our teacher cannot instruct us or advise us any longer. While I exchanged emails and bumped into him on the street, we never met up to talk as we both promised to do repeatedly. There are so many questions I still have for Professor Gray, so many subjects I wish he could still explain to me. Although I will never hear his soft, proud, and witty voice again, I will always strive to bring my own voice to my own ideas and, as Professor Gray repeatedly quoted Aristotle, ""Do the right thing, at the right time, in the right place, for the right reason.""Ben Fishman is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science and history."
334,From Homer to Joyce,30 January 2002,"By Avigayil DruckA 74-year-old Professor Emeritus of English and Comparative Literature, Wallace Gray held the record for the most years of service at Columbia teaching Literature Humanities. Every Monday and Wednesday at 2:10, he sat in the front left-hand corner of the classroom with a bottle of Fiji water in front of him. Professor Gray insisted on teaching in the same classroom every year, Carman 114, regardless of where the registrar placed his class. He began the first class by saying that all stories, ancient and modern, have two elements, and he proceeded to make us guess what those were. The twenty of us tried to appear intellectual and impress him with our academic knowledge and deep insight, yet he surprised us all by saying the crucial elements in common were simply sex and death. Later in the year, the class entered to see a quote written on the chalkboard from Jean-Luc Godard which furthered his point: ""All you need for a movie is a girl and a gun."" There was no doubt in my mind tiiat he was brilliant, and there was equal certainty that being in his class would be an experience. Every class that followed was as eventful as that first one. Professor Gray loved Greece, where he spent many summers digging in the sun, and so his lectures on the Iliad, Odyssey, and the tragedies were particularly detailed. He told of the Thesmophoria and the Eleusinian mysteries. He passed out Xeroxes from ""The Reign of the Phallus —Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens,"" by Eva C. Keuls, complete with photographs of ancient pottery from that period. He told us not to call Mark Wahlberg ""Marky Mark."" Professor Gray's class was the best class I took as a Columbia first-year, and certainly the most memorable. We read Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel and spent part of class reading aloud both positive and negative descriptions of the male reproductive organ. When teaching the Symposium, he handed out statistics for consensual ages for both homosexual and heterosexual sex in countries around the world. Professor Gray was a close personal friend of Flannery O'Connor —he described her writings as ""hard-core spiritual pornography""—and so his insights on her stories in A Good Man Is Hard to Find were even more meaningful than usual. ""I discussed every one of these stories with Flannery,"" he told us. ""I know what I'm talking about."" He was intimidating and unpredictable. One girl burstinto tears during our second class meeting when he seemingly spontaneously lashed out at her, and within the first month, two other students decided to drop his class along with her. Initially, those who remained were scared to speak, were afraid to look the wrong way, and were terrified of being called upon to respond. As the year progressed, we learned that class participation was a rare event. Professor Gray made no attempt to run a discussion group. His class was 99 percent lecture; the other one percent consisted of ""Am I right, Druck?"" or ""Don't you agree, so-and-so?"" All he expected was a nod in return. Alyosha, Dmitri, and Katya of The Brothers Karamazov became the focus of our class in the springtime, and ""verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit"" Oohn 12:24) became its mantra. We spent a day commemorating the Holocaust by reading the poem ""Todesfugue"" both in German and in English. He asked me, the resident observant Jew, whether I preferred my God to Zeus. Professor Gray soon became the favorite of many of his students. He possessed a tremendous amount of knowledge, and strongly desired to impart it to his students. He taught us about tripartite structure, arete, and eudemonia. He taught us the need to ""know thyself."" He did not give letter grades on individual essays and taught us never to dare look at our returned essays while we were still in the classroom. He tried desperately hard to transform us all into Aristotelians. He challenged us, made us uncomfortable, deliberately agitated us, and made us laugh. He made us think, helped us learn, and prepared us for life. He cared about us. Professor Wallace Gray died of a heart attack on Dec. 21. All of his students will remember him. His ideas will remain with us, in our minds and in our hearts, as well as with those who did not have the privilege of having him as a teacher. Professor Gray took his forty-eight years of teaching seriously—ever so thoughtful, he wrote From Homer to Joyce, ensuring that generations of Lit Hum students will have the finest ideas on the curriculum at the tips of their fingers. For this godlike act, he doesn't want gratitude, nor does he need acknowledgement. All he expects is a nod in return.The author is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in biology."
335,Hamilton Renovations Move into Next Phase,14 February 2002,"By Joe Feldman Columbia Daily Spectator■ The five-year renovation plan also focuses on converting classrooms into modern, seminar-style roomsThe Admissions Office moved into its newly renovated offices in Hamilton Hall this semester just before regular decision applications began pouring in, but that change is only one of many to affect one of Columbia's most-used buildings over the next few years. Begun in December 2000, the Hamilton renovation project is part of the University's five-year capital plan to ""improve the infrastructure commitments of a variety of buildings on campus,"" according to Stephen Burke, program manager of arts and sciences. The renovation includes classrooms, administrative offices, and the general infrastructure of the building. The systems of the building, including the electrical and data lines, are also being improved. The architectural firm Kliment and Halsband is in charge of the project. The estimated project budget is in the range of $15.5 million. ""It is essentially gift-driven. The infrastructure is being paid for fromCapital Renewal Funds, while the renovation of program space is being driven by gifts,"" Burke said. The entire building should be renovated by 2005. ""This coming summer we anticipate doing thirteen classrooms and that will give us a bulk of the classrooms, and then in successive summers we will be looking to fill out the rest of the balance,"" said Burke. Classroom Renovations Add Seminar-Style Seating Burke said the Hamilton renovations are mostly ""classroom-driven since a large majority of the Registrar's classrooms are in Hamilton."" According to John Lenzi, University Registrar, ""It's been about twenty five years since the last major classroom renovation. We're happy to see this happen because it's been needed. Hamilton holds 38 out of the 128 classrooms that the Registrar handles. Hamilton has the largest number of classrooms in one building that affect not only theCollege but the whole University."" 'There are a number of goals that everyone is trying to accomplish,"" Burke said. ""Seating capacity is one [issue] for the Registrar and [Columbia] College to deal with. Our goal is to split the space between offices and classrooms."" The primary goal of the project is upgrading the quality and conditionof the classrooms. Classrooms are not being restructured but are being remodeled into seminar style rooms or rooms with moveable chairs. ""Insofar as teaching goes, instructors prefer seminar-style,"" Lenzi said. ""So we are starting an increase in more seminar-style rooms. That's specifically to meet the needs and expansion of the Core."" The long rows of wooden chairs and desks in old Hamilton roomscan be a pain for teachers looking to foster discussion, and Director of Core Curriculum Eileen Gillooly is ready for the change. 'There is a connection between presence of a room and pedagogical success. Classes in Pupin are perceived by both teachers and students as obstacles,"" Gillooly said. She supports the transformation of most classrooms to seminar-style rooms, even though this cuts down on the rooms' space capacity. ""The Registrar has done faculty surveys on class configuration: moveable, fixed, and seminar-style seating. We tried to canvass the fac-ulty on that because there it really affects the pedagogy,"" Lenzi said. Core instructors are still undecided between moveable and seminar seating, but ""fixed seats are all in the big lecture hall classrooms."" Gillooly said her dream is for Hamilton all of the Core's classes. Kathryn Yatrakis, Dean of Academic Affairs, corroborated thisvision. ""Besides offering a better environment for departmental teaching including improved technological resources, our goal is also to accommodate all our Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization classes in Hamilton Hall,"" she said. Eight classrooms were renovated last summer. As Gillooly said, ""It was time for renovation."" ""Students and faculty who have had classes in some of the rooms that were renovated last summer have been very enthusiastic about the upgraded classroom environment,"" Yatrakis said. Francis Lovett, instructor of Contemporary Civilization in renovated room 302 was mostly pleased. ""I think that the renovations are good, even though the class is too big so that everyone can't fit around the table,"" he said. Administrative Office Renovations Centralize Space Core administrators will move into the space previously occupied the old Admissions Office. Gillooly is excited about the possibilities of the new office since there will be more space than ever before, as well as some multi-use spaces. The new Core Office will house the general office, Gillooly's private office, and a lending library for Lit Hum and CC professors and instructors. Gillooly said she hopes the common conference room will provide a space for ""more interactions which will lead to an integra-tion of social, intellectual, curriculum and pedagogy, that is more likely when you bring people together."" Yatrakis agreed with Gillooly, saying, ""We are very excited about the prospect of having a center for the Core Curriculum located on Hamilton's ground floor which will promote informal exchange between faculty and students working together in the Core."""
336,Memorial Service for Wallace Gray,4 April 2002,"There will be a memorial service today for Professor Wallace Gray at 3:3opm in St. Paul's Chapel. Professor Gray died on Dec. 21, 2001 after teaching English and Comparative Literature for over 40 years at Columbia. He retired in 1994, but continued teaching Literature Humanities as a Senior Scholar up until the fall semester. Gray was awarded the Mark van Doren award for excellent teaching in 1975. A reception will follow the service in the Graduate Student Lounge, 302 Philosophy."
337,CTV's Revolution Will Indeed Be Televised,11 April 2002,"By Marianna Tretiak Columbia Daily SpectatorThe semi-annual televised Literature Humanities review, which features a professor addressing pre-final jitters and answering student questions, is the extent of many students' experience with Columbia Television (CTV). Aside from the Lit Hum review, however, CTV is a mystery to many Columbia and Barnard students. ""Every time I turn on to Channel 12 there's nothing on,"" Brian Hansbury, CC 'O3, said. ""I always see a disclaimer about the shows that are going to be on, but never see the show's themselves. Other than catching an occasional movie, I really do not tune in to CTV very often."" CTV, the second oldest college television station in the country, is far removed from its late-1990s golden age, when the station featured many diverse programs. Thestation's move in 2000 from its previous home in Mudd to its new Lerner locale, disabled operations for almost the entire year. This year, CTV is getting back to its previous capacity with new shows, movies, and classic CTV television. Aside from its regular programming, CTV also broadcasts community events as part of its schedule. ""Our programming has jumped incredibly in the last year. We went from having two programs last year to twelve this year,"" said Gerald Jackson Jr., GS 'O2 and the station's programming director. ""We offer all sorts of programming for all sorts of students [and] try to provide a platform for the whole Columbia Community to express themselves."" CTV's current programs include The Thin Line, a movie review program which airs on Wednesday evenings and features full-length films followed by debates between two Kim's Mediaopolis employees. Viewers have the chance to win prizes from Kim's, which has been a key sponsor for CTV, providing them with free movies as well as tech support and video giveaways. Also part of CTVs current programming schedule is Good Evening Columbia, the campus ver-sion of The Tonight Show. Aired live at 9 p.m. on Thursday evenings, the show features student talent, campus wide segments, and a heads-up on weekend events. ""Our program is a great way to tune into the Columbia community,"" said Alaleh Akhavan, CC 'O2 and the program's producer. ""We try to include much of the community."" Other new programs include What's in Lizzy's Pot, a campus-wide cooking program; G-Roots, a music video program; The Row World, areality program about the women's crew team; Student Cinema Salad, a showcase of student films; and The Anime Hour, a weekly screening of various anime features. In the works for later this year is a hip-hop show, Home Grown Subsistence Farming, which will feature live music performances, as well as interviews with artists and feedback from Columbia professors and students.While CTV is currently running on increased capacity, there is still room for growth. Its producers attribute their lack of continual programming to the need for student participation. While the station currently has around 40 members, there is always room for many more. ""We would like to encourage anyone interested to get involved,"" said Kim McArthur, CC 'O2 and CTV station director. 'This is a great way to get into any sort of media. We offer a laid-back atmosphere and are willing to train everyone."" Even with the advances in the station's programming, it has yet to reach everyone in the Columbia community. Students who live in dorms off campus or in Barnard housing, where many students involved with CTV live, do not even have the option to watch the'station, since it is only offered through CU cable in Columbia housing. ""We have been trying to get everyone in the Columbia community access, but we keep hitting administrative brick walls,"" McArthur said. The station also faces continual fiscal difficulties due to lack of funding. CTV currently receives $l5OO per semester from the Activities Board at Columbia, but due to the price of the station's equipment and other technological costs, the money falls short of what the station needs. CTV's new Student Development and Activities adviser, Steven Schwab, hopes to address CTVs problems.""I would ideally like to create a concrete game plan for the future,"" Schwab said. ""The station has an incredible amount of potential, and now that we are finally settled 1 can see us building from here."" When asked about expanding CTV, Schwab sounded positive: ""In the future I would like to see [CTV] added as a public access station to Time Warner's local coverage."" Schwab also said that the station should look beyond Columbia for its resources. ""As more and more stations change over from analog to digital format, I would like to see us solicit donations of the older analog equipment,"" Schwab said.We ... try to provide a platform for the whole Columbia community to express themselves. ' —Gerald Jackson, Jr., GS 'O2The station has an incredible amount of potential. ...

338,Truman Scholars Aspire To Be Public Advocates,12 April 2002,"By James Romoser Spectator Associate News Editor■ The $30,000 graduate school scholarships are given to students who plan to study public policy or service.Columbia's two recipients of the 2002 Truman Scholarship award are talented students, passionate speakers, and, perhaps, future policymakers. And they also happen to be good friends. Cyrus Habib and Robbie Majzner, both CC 'O3, have each received the $30,000 scholarship for graduate school from the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation. The scholarships go to outstanding college juniors who plan to enter the fields of public policy or public service. Seventy-seven students from 65 United States colleges won Truman scholarships this year. Those who know Habib and Majzner describe them as intense and dedicated. 'These are people who are very focused and very passionate,"" said Lavinia Lorch, an assistant dean in the scholars and fellowships office. 'They have a good sense of self,"" she continued, ""and that does not mean they are arrogant—on the contrary."" But despite their similarities, Habib and Majzner are far from the same person. Habib, though small in stature, is ""very noisy; he's got this booming voice"" and a goodsense of humor, Lorch said. Majzner, on the other hand, is six feet tall but ""soft-spoken and gentle,"" she added. A Vision of Advocacy Habib, who is blind, hopes to attend law school and work as an advocate for the disabled. He is majoring in English and concentrating in Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures and computer science —an area that has allowed him to examine the role of computers in the lives of the disabled. Habib initiated a student organization called Columbians Organized for Disability Advocacy, a ""liaison organization between disabled students and the administration that's still in the baby stage right now,"" according to Habib. But while he cares about dis-abled-related issues, Habib does not like to focus on his own disability and does not see himself as a spokesman for the disabled. He deflects all questions about his blindness, saying he has known fewer than three blind people in his life. ""I hate to be a representative for the blind community; I'm notinvolved in the blind community,"" he said. Indeed, Habib lives his life as if he had no disability at all. In addition to founding advocacy groups, winning scholarships, and dealing with the rigors of Columbia classes, Habib also serves on the junior class council and works as an intern for Democratic New York Senator Hillary Clinton (he previously worked for another senator, Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Habib's home state of Washington). Habib enjoys skiing, has played piano professionally, and recently had an original photograph, entitled ""Sightseeing,"" published in a book called Speck. He also has a good ""vision"" for movies, according to Professor Hamid Dabashi, who teaches a class called Sociology of Middle Eastern Cinema in which Habib is enrolled. ""I am so absolutely fascinated by his courage and his imagination and his steadfastness,"" Dabashi said. ""He has in fact become a great resource for me for his extraordinary ability to visualize. ... Never have I been instructed by a student more than I have from Cyrus."" Just as Habib seems to disregard the limits of his disability, he also seems oblivious of the great strides he has made. ""I feel like my experience as a blind person is, by necessity, so different than any other blind people,"" Habib said mildly of his achievements. Admiring Dedication Majzner has achievements of his own. A computer science major and an aspiring physician from New Jersey, he works as a pre-HIV test counselor for Columbia Health Services, and last summer, he worked in a pediatric HIV clinic at Belleview Hospital in lowerManhattan. These experiences, Majzner said, inspired him to pursue the area of international HIV/AIDS policy. ""One of the best things about doing [the Truman Scholarship] application was that it helped me solidify what I wanted to go into,"" said Majzner, who used the policy proposal that was part of the application to focus on programs that could prevent the perinatal transmission of HIV in South Africa. Majzner admires devotion to a cause in the face of adversity. He named former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as one of his role models, ""because he pushed mainstream Israeli society to consider for the first time that peace would be the most advantageous [option], ... He went against what was commonly accepted to help push his society toward an eventual goal of peace."" Majzner's former Literature Humanities professor, RachelAdams, sees some of that same dedication in Majzner. Even when he was only a first-year, ""I saw signs that he was a leader and was going to very successful,"" Adams said. ""He's an excellent student, but he was also the kind of person [who] brought a very infectious enthusiasm to class discussions,"" she said. Last semester, Majzner cofounded Columbia's chapter of Habitat for Humanity, which has allowed him ""to meet and greet interesting people,"" he said. And he is meeting many more this semester studying abroad in Prague. ""Studying abroad has two big advantages,"" Majzner said. ""One, it's a lot easier and a lot less stressful. Two, you get to learn more about yourself and get more perspective."" The People Behind the Scenes At a school often criticized for its red tape, it might come as a surprise that both Habib and Majzner were quick to attribute their winning the scholarship to the help they receiving from the administration, which Majzner called ""amaz-ing."" ""Everyone should pay attention to the e-mails you get,"" he said, because Columbia offers an array of scholarship opportunities. Both students named two deans in particular—Lorch and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Kathleen McDermott —who assisted them in completing the long applications. McDermott said she and Lorch selected four Columbia nomineesfor the Truman scholarship and guided their application process by conducting mock interviews, reviewing their essays, and keeping track of deadlines. ""I've especially been the one who has hounded them,"" McDermott said, comparing herself to Attila the Hun. Despite the involved application process, it was a valuable experience, McDermott said. ""It's a process where they learn so much because they're made to articulate what their values are, what is it they really want to do, and what they care about,"" she said. Lorch agreed, calling the application process a Socratic moment, a way of ""figuring out who you are."" ""Everything you say [on the application] ideally has to make sense and has to be connected and has to be well-integrated in depicting a complete person,"" she said. 'The reason that these guys won ... is that they were truly and genuinely passionate about their subject.""'I am so absolutely fascinated by his courage and his imagination and his steadfastness.' —Prof. Hamid Dabashi on Habib"

340,College Pilots Potential Science Core Course,13 September 2002,"By Juliana Castedo Spectator Associate News Editor■ Students, faculty agree that course will strengthen science's presence within the humanities-heavy CoreNext year, Columbia College first-years may be required to read articles on the way the brain works, participate in discussions about the latest technological developments, and attend large lectures on global climate change. Administrators and students are now pilot testing ""Frontiers in Science,"" a potential Columbia College Core science course —its name yet to be determined —which supporters hope will begin next year. As it is envisioned now, the sin-gle-semester course would be mandatory for all first-years. Unlike other Core courses, it would include one large lecture a week, taught by researchers at the forefront of their fields, in addition to weekly discussion sections of aboilt twenty students. The course would cover contemporary issues in various areas of science instead of a canon of scientific texts and would therefore have a syllabus of articles rather than books. This year's pilot is an experiment to see if such a course would be successful. Twenty students, of the more than 100 who applied, are being selected to attend monthly lectures, which are open to the public and free to students, followed by a 75-minute discussion on the lecture and, a week later, a discussion to critique the course. Shifting the Focus of the Core Curriculum The Core science course is anattempt to ""rectify the gross imbalance"" between science and the humanities in the College, said Professor David Helfand, chair of the Astronomy department. Helfand has wanted to create such a course for twenty years and has led its two year-development, along with Biological Sciences Professor Darcy Kelley and Astronomy Professor Jacqueline Van Gorkom. Despite the three semesters of science that College students are currently required to take, Helfand argued that science has never really been ""part of the culture"" of the College in the way that Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization are. The new course would not add to the current science requirements—it would replace the third semester of science currently required—but, Helfand believes, it would put a greater emphasis on science in the Core Curriculum by providing a common experience in science for all College students. He said he hopes that students would then be able to discuss their scientific studies outside of class as they might now discuss Homer or Plato. Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that the course will ""put science on the same plane as art, literature, music, and philosophy"" at Columbia and described the new course as ""a statement saying that science is so important to our education.""A New Approach to Science Although the structure of the science course would differ significantly from that of other Core courses, Yatrakis explained that its purpose would be parallel. ""At their best, Lit Hum and CC don't honor great books but the debate [inspired by them],"" Yatrakis said. '""What's really important is how students engage with the works."" She explained that the Core science course would give students the opportunity to do the same kind of thinking about topics in science. Kelley and Helfand both said the course would expose students to ""scientific habits of mind,"" a term coined by John Dewey that encapsulates the different ways that scientists approach intellectual problems, such as the use of the experiment as ""the most useful intellectual tool,"" as Kelley called it. Kelley also considers an important goal of the course to be ""introducing students to the excitement of science"" and says that goal is one of the reasons it will focus on contemporary scientific developments. Jose Negrette, CC 'O5, who applied to participate in the ""Frontiers of Science"" pilot, is interested in the course because he thinks a lot of students do not have a ""good perspective on scientific thinking."" Like Helfand, he sees a hole in the current Core Curriculum because while Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization ""deal with how man sees himself, no Core course deals with how man sees nature."" Impact on Students One concern about the course raised by Professor Bruce Berne, chair of the Chemistry Department, and echoed by students, is the additional burden a required coursewould impose on College science majors. Berne pointed out that even though the science Core course would not add to the Core Curriculum's science distribution requirements, it would be an extra required class for science majors, who currently fulfill all Core science requirements by default. Science majors already have schedules packed with science courses, he said, and therefore cannot ""experiment in other areas"" of study as much as non-science majors can. While Berne said he does not have a solution to this problem, he stressed repeatedly that he is ""in no way opposed"" to the idea of a core class in science. He added that he would even like to participate in thecourse if he had the time. Lauren Ende, CC 'O4 and a Biological Sciences major, agreed with Berne's concern. She explained that ""it's really hard to be a science major"" in the College because of all the Core requirements in addition to the science major requirements. Ende reiterated Berne's argument that an extra requirement would prevent science majors from taking electives. Although many science majors echoed Ende's sentiments, Negrette, who plans to major in Astrophysics, said he did not think of the course as added work. ""Science majors have a certain appreciation for science,"" Negrette said, explaining that majors wouldtherefore enjoy the course in the same way that non-science majors ""probably enjoy CC or Lit Hum."" Ende admitted that the course itself is a ""great idea but should be an option"" and suggested that the problems she sees could be solved by making it a junior or senior course and exempting science majors. She pointed out that this arrangement would continue the common experience of the core curriculum into junior or senior year, ""bringing the class together again."" She also said taking the course later would make more sense since it would focus on current developments; if students took the course in their first years, the material could be outdated by the time they graduated. Implementing the Course Yatrakis emphasized the fact that the pilot is a ""true experiment"" and that the future of the course remains uncertain at the moment. Although it may become part of the Core as early as next year, much of its fate will be determined by the feedback provided by students in the pilot. If the course is implemented in its current form, its organizers will begin advertising for science fellows to teach discussion sections. The fellows chosen will necessarily be interested in interdisciplinary study, since the course will cover many areas of science. Helfand said that fellows are ideal because they are currently conducting research of their own but could also use teaching experience. As a result, he said, the science Core will not require as many professors or teaching assistants as other Core courses do. 'We don't want to create something not sustainable,"" Helfand said. He expressed a hope that the course will add to ""the unique educational experience"" that Columbia provides.'[Hie course] will put science on the same plane as art, literature, music, and philosophy.' —Kathryn Yatrakis, Dean of Academic AffairsAstronomy Department Chair David Helfand, center, has led the initiative to create a Core Curriculum science class."
341,Dogears.net Creator Looks To Expand Site,16 September 2002,"By Juliana Castedo Spectator Associate News EditorNow that the dog days of summer have ended, students desperately scrambling for a cheap read need look no further than dogears.net. When Dogears, a website that allows students to buy and sell books online, first became operational a year ago, the service was limited to Columbia and Barnard students, and its creator, Tony Vassilev, CC 'O3, had to buy books to post to the site because there were no sellers using it. Now, the site has 1,436 registered Columbia users and offers its services to 17 schools. Vassilev started Dogears to make it easier for students to save money on course books. Users of the site can post information about books they want to sell, and other users from the same school can search for books by title, author, ordepartment and then compare prices and e-mail sellers. Once Dogears notifies a seller that another student wants to buy his book, the students are responsible for executing the sale. Vassilev said he has received positive feedback about the site from students. Tecuan Flores, SEAS'O4, uses the site and praised it for providing an alternative to postering residence halls and classrooms to sell books. Along with many other students, Flores has successfully sold several books through the site. For the site's one-year anniversary, Vassilev decided to analyze the site's transaction records to quantify its success. Vassilev warned that his statistics represent the number of requests made rather than the number of sales that occurred, since the sale of books is done not by Dogears, but by students.The results show that while many students registered with Dogears are not using it successfully, usage of the website has increased dramatically since last year. In Dogears's one year of existence, 1,584 book requests have been made, and more than twothirds of those requests were made this semester. But the 1,024 books requested through Dogears this semester were sold by only 302 users and requested by only 339 users. 116 people belong to both groups, so 525 people in total have been involved in a request, suggesting that a large percentage of people registered with Dogears have neither sold nor purchased any books this semester. Nicole Safranek, BC 'O5, is registered with Dogears but has not yet made any transactions. She has posted books for sale because she said doing so is easier than putting up flyers, but she has not received any requests for her books. Nor has she purchased any books; the seller did not reply the one time she found a book she needed to buy. Consequently, she said she has lost confidence in the site, thoughshe maintained the idea is a good one. Despite the relatively small number of people using Dogears, a total of $33,431 has been made by its sellers this semester; typical sellers receive $110.70 selling their books on the site, at an average of $32.65 a book. Michael Dreyfus, CC 'O4, hasused Dogears since last year and has successfully sold books through the website, but he said the site provides a ""buyer's market."" He said that because sellers can see how much money all the other sellers are asking for specific books, ""prices are driven down"" and it is harder for a seller to make a profit. Dreyfus said a seller could make more money by posting flyers advertising books, but using Dogears is more convenient and is therefore a more attractive option for many students. Dreyfus and Flores both reported that it is easier for buyers to find books earlier in their academic careers because older students are more likely to keep books they may continue to refer to within their majors. Therefore, students looking for Literature Humanities books may have more to choose from than students looking for upper level English department courses. Recently, Vassilev has begun trying to expand Dogears to other colleges and universities. While users can now register as students of 17 different schools, from Princeton University to Bethel College, Vassilev explained that there isn't enough advertising for the site at other schools yet. He has only recently contacted students at other schools to promote the site. Vassilev hopes to expand the site at Columbia in several ways. He was recently encouraged to turn the site into a general marketplace when he found a requested posting on the site for a ""book"" with the title ""Refrigerator"" and the author ""Kenmore."" He also plans to implement a feedback system through which buyers can rate sellers, thus improving the site's reliability. In order to facilitate this expansion, Vassilev has found a number of students interested in helping him with the site, including the site's new programmer-in-chief, Andrew Arnold, CC 'O3. Arnold said he was drawn to the project because ""it seemed like such an intuitive idea that there was a need for.""'lt seemed like such an intuitive idea that there was a need for [Dogears].' —Andrew Arnold, CC 'O3Street book vendors, nothing!

342,Hamilton Revamped for Friendlier Feeling,25 September 2002,"By Jai Kapadia Columbia Daily SpectatorThe elevator in Hamilton Hall is still too small, too slow, and too stuffy, but after extensive renovations this summer, many of Hamilton's classrooms have a new look. The upgrades, which included renovations to many of the rooms in Hamilton that house Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization classes, signal Columbia College's commitment to improving its Core classes. Superior wood quality, brighter lighting, acoustic panel improvements, new furniture, and central heating and cooling systems are among the recent changes. But the focus of the renovations was not only to physically overhaul the classrooms, but to engender a more intellectual and personal environment, as well. Associate Dean of Administration and Planning Sue Mescher said the most important of the renovations was to improve the lighting in order the give classrooms a brighter atmosphere. Mescher said the new lighting has made a big difference. ""If you look at the rooms from College Walk at night, its amazing how they shine,"" she said. Classroom acoustics were also upgraded. After many studentscomplained that they could not hear instructors because of poor acoustics and high ceilings, renovators equipped a number of classrooms with new acoustic panels enabling voices to carry more lyCC Instructor Brian Soucek was thrilled to get a renovated room for a second year in a row. ""I think one of the great things about the renovation is that no one seems to be relegated down to somewhere like the basement of Pupin anymore. No one's teaching class in a dungeon,"" Soucek said. Soucek also likes the idea of students sitting around the same table, instead of sitting on individual desks, since he feels that this is ""symbolic of what is supposed to happen in a class like CC or Lit Hum."" While a number of the seminar rooms have been completed, many of the larger lecture rooms are scheduled to be renovated next summer. The aim is to re-orient these classrooms, equip them with better technology, and most importantly, provide them with a newer, warmer atmosphere, Mescher said. A number of students continue to complain about the regular rush in the Hamilton elevator. Jeremiah Stoldt, the director of facilities and administration, recognizes this problem but said the addition of anew elevator was unfeasible because it would reduce classroom space. The Hamilton lobby, which is currently under construction, is scheduled for completion in November. Efforts to restore the grandeur of this traditional building include changing the floor in the lobby and creating more open space. Architects have also attempted to build wider entrances in order to ease the crowds of student traffic in and out of doorways during peak class hours. The Hamilton Hall renovation project began in the winter of 200001. During the summer of 2001, eight classrooms on the third and fourth floors were renovated, along with the admissions office on the first floor and the Core Curriculum Office on the second floor. During this past summer, an additional 14 classrooms, the Dean's suite, and the lobby all underwent renovations. Mescher was excited about the renovations and attributed their success to alumni contributions. Students seem to share the same enthusiasm about the classrooms. Christopher Mellia, CC 'O4, said, 'The classrooms definitely have a more refreshing feel to them. If only the administration would do the same for places like Wien!""Renovations to Hamilton's lobby, to be completed in November, include replacing floor surfaces and creating more open space."
343,A View from the Heights Train Not Bound for Glory,1 October 2002,"Train Not Bound for GloryA year after last fall's tragedy, I began to see ""resilience"" as just another politicized word, standing next to ""terror,"" ""freedom,"" and ""unity."" The police officers, firefighters, and other rescue workers are resilient in responding to crises; end of story. But on Saturday morning, resilience showed its face to me personally for the first time. I boarded the uptown No. 1 train at Penn Station at an hour when I should have been asleep. I resolved that I deserved to sit all the way back to Columbia, scanned the cars for an empty seat, and sat down just before the train pulled away. Shortly after leaving Penn, the train came to a smooth stop. Trains stop all the time, I told myself. I expected the conductor to announce any second, ""We are being held by the dispatcher and will be moving shortly,"" but the announcement never came.Instead of hearing a voice of reassurance, I soon saw an unforgettable image of despair. The door at the front of our car swept open, and a flood of people poured through, telling us to run with them. One woman yelled out ""bomba,"" and although I do not know Spanish, I knew what that meant. We ran down the train from car to car, some of us hysterical, the rest simply stunned, until we were shoulder to shoulder near the back of the train. Someone screamed, ""Can't we go further?"" We crowded in a little more. As in every emergency situation, a few people took charge, asking the passengers to stay calm. ""If we keep shouting, we won't be able to hear the announcements,"" one man directed. ""Sit down and relax."" Finally the conductor reached us through the loudspeaker: ""Get to the back!"" We were already there. ""Get to the front!"" The grim faces on the passengers who had been at the front of the train indicated that no one should move back up—that something terrible was up there. I was not the only straphanger who feared the worst: a gun, a bomb, nerve gas, anthrax. The conductor spoke again, calmer this time: ""Get up to the conductor. We're going to get you off the train."" We formed a single-file line, and I followed, not sure exactly how one leaves a train in the middle of a tunnel. I reached the conductor's car and was guided to a walkway on the tunnel wall not more than two feet wide. The yellow pipe I had seen while riding trains turned out to be a handrail. I stopped to let some firefighters pass, then walked, slowly and orderly, toward a distant light, a thenindeterminable distance that turned out to be roughly two blocks. At some points the handrail faded into a beam along the wall; a woman behind me grabbed myarm for support. My fellow travelers and I walked those two blocks like blind lemmings until we reached the platform back at Penn Station. As far as I know, no one was injured. My injuries, like those of the people around me, were simple: dirty hands and a shaken psyche. Passing back through the turnstile to the street, I was offered a pink block ticket, which would allow me to ""continue my journey"" within 48 hours. This was one journey I would not continue. I simply wanted to go home, and after exchanging a few kind words and hugs on the street, I watched the fire trucks two blocks up Seventh Avenue before hailing a cab back uptown on Eighth.I'm still shaken by what happened. The incident itself does not bother me. I do not know very many details, other than that it was electrical in nature. Even the midtunnel evacuation fails to choke my intuition. But the image of a frantic mob running through the train, like the Hoover Dam bursting at its seams, lingers every time I try to sleep or think about anything other than the incident. ""Bomba,"" the fear and the despair all haunt me, associating themselves with seemingly inconsequential events. This past Sunday in church, a little girl liberated herself from her parents and ran up and down the aisles; the echo of her swift-moving little feet on the linoleum reminded me of the sprinting masses on the No. 1. Every person walking up Broadway with a cane reminds me of someone who no longer has one; before leaving the train, I noticed a lost cane dangling from a strap. I came away from the accident having learned two lessons. The first is simply the law of unpredictability and equality. Running through the train, distinctions of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation no longer apply, nor is it possible to predict who will stand up and take action. The initiative of the person who asked us to stay calm, as well as another who held the door open to allow roughly 10 of us to precede him in line, most likely did not come from the heroism of the texts in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization; it came from an instinctual response. The second is that resilience, more than a tokenized piece of rhetoric, is a state of mind. The firefighters and transit workers followed their duties precisely to bring us back to safety. And we as New Yorkers used our constant, if often latent, interdependence to take care of one another. Tomorrow I must return to the subway for a meeting in Midtown. I may be shaken, but I will go on.Joe ValentiJoe Valenti is a Columbia College sophomore."
344,Academic Success Program Expands in Second Year,23 October 2002,"By Molly Gutman Columbia Daily Spectator■ New offerings in the program include workshops on time management, test preparation, and note-taking.At the start of its second year, Columbia University's Academic Success Programs is expanding, both in the services it offers and in its collaboration with other academic service programs and organizations. ASP was created last year as an extension of Opportunity Programs and Undergraduate Services, a program that offers its participants full financial aid, counseling, mentoring programs, tutorial services, and a semester book allowance. Students who apply to Columbia through general admission are referred to the program based on their financial need, and they must attend an interview before being admitted. This year, the program has been expanded to include various academic seminars, which include workshops on time management, note taking, test preparation, reading for retention, and different learning styles. ""We just try to anticipate the students' needs,"" said Sunday Coward, assistant dean of ASP and directorof OPUS. ""Between the two of us, the class center and our office, we'll find the student and have them come on in and fill out the forms. I think it's more proactive than anything."" In order for the ASP staff to gain insight into student needs, the students who receive tutoring services are asked to fill out a form and denote beneficial workshops. ""They fill out what workshops they're interested in, and we create those workshops for them,"" Jorge Sandoval, assistant director of ASP and OPUS said. ""So if they're interested in note-taking, we'll send out an e-mail to these students."" As a result of the new seminars, a wider range of students can benefit from ASP. ""We've done small series catering to just the opportunity program students or just a small group of tutoring students, but now it's opened up to everyone,"" Coward said. ""You don't necessarily have to be signed up for tutoring to attend the seminars."" Not only is ASP adding new workshops, it is also collaboratingwith other academic service programs. The mentoring, for example, is done through the Intercultural Resource Center. ""[Students] can go to one place to get the same services, because we all work together to provide them,"" Coward said. Another notable feature of OPUS is the low student-to-counselor ratio. 'The sections are really small, so we get to ask any questions we have,"" Estevez said. An additional benefit to OPUS is that its participants gain the opportunity to attend the Summer Humanities and Science Program before entering Columbia. The program exposes them to some of the Core courses they will take at Columbia like Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, as well as calculus, psychology, and chemistry.Students involved in the programs have expressed satisfaction with ASP. ""The program really helps us,"" said Rosa Estevez, SEAS 'O6, a member of the OPUS student council. ""They offer us a lot of opportunities to succeed. We just have to take advantage of those things that they offer."" Marcela Calidonio, CC 'O6, a student coordinator in ASP agreed. ""It's great, because they are very helpful,"" she said.'They motivate you to want to be involved."" However, students not currently involved in ASP still seem reluctant about attending the seminars. ""Based on past experience of what those programs tend to be like, they seem to be the same things you hear all the time,"" Adam Lehenbaur, CC 'O6, said. ""However, it would be worth it to go see if they have anything useful to say.""Others did not think the programs would suit their needs. ""I'm sure that they must be helping some people,"" said John Jung, CC 'O6. ""But we already know how to study, and things like that, and that's probably not something we need to learn, at least for me."" OPUS is composed of two subprograms: Higher Education Opportunity Program and National Opportunity Program. To be eligible for both programs, students must demonstrate need for the services, as well as meet specified economic eligibility requirements. The programs differ in the fact that while NOP is institutionally funded by the College and the School of Engineering, HEOP is funded jointly between Columbia University and the state. As a result, HEOP is open only to students who are residents of New York state.The program really helps us. They offer us a lot of opportunities to succeed.' —Rosa Estevez, SEAS 'O6'[Students] can go to one place to get the same services, because we all work together to provide them.' —OPUS Director Sunday Coward"
345,Professors Recognized For Service To Core,22 November 2002,"By Katie Goldstein Spectator Associate News Editor■ lan Bent and Eileen Gillooly were honored at yesterday's ceremony.Yesterday's reception for the Tenth Annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum was characterized by a lighter atmosphere than one might expect from an academic award ceremony. Lan Bent, Anne Parsons Bender Professor of Music, and Eileen Gillooly, Director of the College Core Curriculum, received the Core Award, while Sandra Pierson Prior, associate professor of English and Comparative Literature, was recognized with a special award for service in the Logic and Rhetoric program. At the reception, which was held in the Heyman Center for the Humanities, faculty and students praised the accomplishments of the three professors and their instrumental roles in the Core, often adding humorous anecdotes to their speeches. Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley praised the renowned Core in his opening remarks to the reception. ""National interest in general education is gaining renewed momentum,"" Quigley said, citing a recent article from the Harvard Crimson that praised Columbia's Core as a model for the restructuring of Harvard's own core curriculum. In his remarks about Bent, Music Professor Walter Frisch read several definitions of the word ""core"" from the Oxford English Dictionary, all of which he said stray from the more positive associations of the word today. His reading of the definitions, which ranged from ""something that sticks in one's throat"" to ""a disease of sheep,"" provoked laughter from the attendees. ""Lan has been a coeur [French for heart],"" Frisch said of Bent's 16 years at Columbia. ""He caught on so quickly and became so involved in the spirit of our Core."" Frisch praised Bent, who has been chairman of Music Humanities for the past five years, for innovations in the course's web site. Maja Cerar, a graduate student instructor of Music Humanities, who collaborated with Bent on partsof the-web site, cited Bent's ""diligence, energy, and perseverance that I never would have thought to lie in one person's personality."" Gillooly was equally commended for her contribution to the core. Professor Cathy Popkin praised Gillooly as ""the core of the Core,"" and paraphrased Saint Augustine in an homage to Literature Humanities: ""You are great Eileen and greatest to be praised."" ""I was sure that she must have won the award already,"" said Professor James Zetzel, Director of Contemporary Civilization, adding that Gillooly has headed the Core longer than the Core Award has existed. Both speakers emphasized Gillooly's administrative skill as director of the Core. After receiving their awards, Bent and Gillooly each addressed what they have learned as a result of their involvement with the Core. ""I realized I must throw away the score and engage with the music,"" Bent said of teaching Music Humanities. Popkin described the knowledge she has gained about various academic departments due to the Core's reliance on professors from about 15 different departments. Prior was praised for integrating writing into the Core Curriculum. Edward Tayler, the ""patriarch of L&R"" and Lionel Trilling Professor in Humanities, spoke about Prior after quipping that the three-minute time limit for speaking was ""scarcely enough time to protest there's not enough time."" Citing her ""combination of sympathy, humanity, and rigor,"" Tayler called the position of L&R instructor ""the most difficult teaching assignment in the University,"" adding that Prior had guided hundreds of graduate students in the teaching of writing to undergraduates. ""L&R could not have lasted more than two semesters if she had not had the power to resist,"" Tayler said, referencing calls to change the curriculum during Prior's directorship of the composition program. After receiving her award, Prior spoke of the aspects of Columbia's composition program she hopes will remain in her absence and of her desire to continue to see ""students become their own best editors."""
346,New Colloquium Course Will Combine East and West,5 December 2002,"By Jessica Gresko Spectator Associate News Editor■ The new team-taught course, Nobility and Civility, will examine leadership and citizenship in both traditions.Four teachers. Fifteen students. One new course. Next semester Columbia College will offer Nobility and Civility, a small team-taught course, which will examine the ideas of leadership and citizenship in classical periods in the East and West. A Continuation of the Core The course, approved by the Columbia College Committee on Instruction at the end of November, is intended for juniors and seniors who have completed Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and either Asian Humanities or Asian Civilization. ""Right now you have separate courses, but they aren't integrated in any way. What we're trying to do is establish a set of courses that bring the major traditions together to discuss what we call core issues,"" saidWilliam Theodore de Bary, director of the Heyman Center for the Humanities, John Mitchell Mason Professor Emeritus of the University, and Provost Emeritus. The Core is often criticized for its western focus. This course, de Bary said, will attempt to bring together East and West. In addition, during 2003-2004 there are plans to add two more team-taught, interdisciplinary courses that will form a sequence that explores nobility and civility in medieval and modern periods in eastern and western traditions. De Bary, who has been one of the driving forces behind the courses, will also be one of the professors teaching in the spring. He will be joined by Peter Pouncey, Professor Emeritus of Classics and President Emeritus of Amherst College, Columbia history professor Richard Bulliet, and Gary Tubb, Senior Lecturer in Religion and MiddleEastern Studies. The College would usually not be able to fund a course with four instructors because of the expense. Because de Bary and Pouncey are emeritus professors, they are being paid small stipends through the Heyman Center, not the College. Professors at the Heyman Center spurred the initial development of the course. In May 2002 the center was awarded a $309,000 grant. It is using the grant money to fund three workshops that set the curriculum for the three planned courses. During the first workshop, which took place last summer, members of the faculty drew up a preliminary syllabus for the course. The second workshop will create a syllabus for the medieval period class and will be held May 27 to June 13, 2003. A Continuation of the Past All three courses are being modeled on courses called colloquia thatwere taught for decades beginning in the 19305. The original colloquia courses turned into Lit Hum, but courses designated as College Colloquia, which were limited to a few students and team-taught by two professors, were taught sporadically up until a few years ago. Currently, Nobility and Civility is listed under ""colloquium"" in the online bulletin but is not intended to be a revival of the old college colloquium course, said James Mirollo, Professor Emeritus of English and Comparative Literature, who taught colloquia in the past and is one of the senior scholars who helped plan the course. ""[A colloquium course] met once a week, and there were two professors. It began late on a Wednesday evening, and it would go on until everyone fainted from lack of sleep,""Mirollo said. Nobility and Civility is scheduled for a similar time slot—Wednesday evenings from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. De Bary said he cannot speculate what student interest will be in the course, especially since the course was announced after many students had already planned their spring courses. But he suggested the course might have a second section if there are enough interested students.David Bornstein, CC 'O3, was interested in the class even before it became official. Bornstein, who hasbeen one of de Bary's students for three semesters and plans to major in philosophy, was one of two undergraduates who participated in the planning workshop for the course last summer. ""I think that the class will be of great interest to those who are searching for a broad education, who want to transcend the bounds of the Core Curriculum and of the Western canon,"" Bornstein said. He also praised the professors. ""The richness of talent thaf s going to be sitting in that r00m.... The students could just sit back and listen to those scholars, and that would be an education in itself,"" Bornstein added. But students will not be able to sit back. They will already be particularly familiar with some of the course's texts as the class will reexamine relevant parts of works from Literature Humanities andContemporary Civilization, like the Iliad, Thucydides, Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Ethics, St. Augustine's City of God, and other works they have seen in Asian Humanities or Asian Civilizations —the Ramayana, the Dhammapada, Bhagavad Gita,"
347,Rhodes Recipient Strives to Fuse Science and Literature,6 February 2003,"By Debbie Newman Columbia Daily Spectator■ Renaissance man Jonah Lehrer plans to pursue an Oxford BA in psychology, philosophy, and physiology.Jonah Lehrer spent most of last year working at the worldrenowned restaurant Le Cirque. But he's more than just a line-cook. Lehrer graduated this fall as a neuroscience major and was editor-in-chief of a Columbia poetry journal. He is also an avid reader of 19th century British literature and a Bob Dylan fan. In recognition of his varied skills, talents, and interests, Lehrer was selected this December as one of the nation's 32 Rhodes Scholars from a pool of 981 nominees. Lehrer says he learned a great deal from the application process. ""You meet these amazing kids, and you feel lucky just to be in a room with them,"" Lehrer said. ""You think, I don't have a chance, they've all done more than me. It's incredibly humbling."" Lavinia Lorch, a dean of studentaffairs, was thrilled to learn of Lehrer's selection. ""Even before he won, I thoughtthat he was a wonderful candidate,"" said Lorch, who worked closely with Lehrer on his application. ""He's a well-rounded and healthilygrounded individual, a real rarity."" Elizabeth Scharffenberger, a professor in Columbia's Classics Department, says that Lehrer's scientific mind made him ""an exceptional presence"" in her Literature Humanities class in his freshman year. ""He really manages to combine these disparate interests with uncommon grace,"" Scharffenberger said. ""They couldn't have picked a better applicant."" Lehrer's goal is to fuse his two academic interests, science and literature, as a science writer. ""I love science, and I love Jane Austen and books,"" he said. ""And I would love someday to reveal the beauty in science—it's just another way to get at the truth."" This inquisitive nature, combined with his versatility, may have helped win him favor in the eyes of the judges. ""One thing I definitely learned in the interview process is that they're not giving you money tostudy because they think you already know all the answers. Think out loud, say 'I don't know.' It's okay to be curious."" Indeed, Lehrer confesses that he is constantly pondering the mysteries of the universe. He finds ample time to reflect while he cooks, which is one of the reasons that he finds the pastime so enjoyable. ""[Cooking] really is a sport,"" he explains. ""I love the tasting and the manual labor. You get eight hours a night—while you're melting butter —to think of the Iliad. It really is manual labor balanced with luxurious intellectual life."" Objecting to a description of his unique perspective on cooking as ""extraordinary,"" Lehrer laughs and offers a humble protest. ""I'm normal, beyond normal,"" insists the soft-spoken scholar. Lehrer will have an opportunity to work towards the extraordinary when he pursues his interests in multiple disciplines at Oxford in the fall. He plans to graduate with a BA in psychology, philosophy, and physiology—an ideal background for a science writer.Recent graduate Jonah Lehrer is one of this year's 32 winners of the Rhodes Scholarship."
348,An Interview,13 February 2003,"William Bennett provides insight into the history of student protest and his views on war and higher education-■ An interview with noted scholar and author William J Bennett, a former Secretary of Education under Reagan.William J. Bennett is a busy man. Since moving to Washington from Harvard University to serve as Secretary of Education under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, he has become one of the nation's foremost conservative spokesmen, straddling the worlds of media and government. Bennett served as Secretary of Education and then Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities under Ronald Reagan, and acted as President George H. W. Bush's ""drug czar."" He is currently the co-director of Empower America, a neo-conserva-tive political advocacy organization, alongside former Republican congressman and 1996 Vice Presidential candidate Jack Kemp. Bennett also co-chairs the National Commission on Civic Renewal and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. But Bennett is most widely known as an author. His name is on 14 books including The Book of Virtues and The Death of Outrage both touchstones of the past decade's culture wars. Bennett took time out of his busy schedule to speak briefly with the Spectator after an Americans for Victory Over Terrorism event last night. There is a major protest coming up this Saturday at the United Nations over a possible invasion of Iraq. What would you say to the protesters? I would say what was said tonight. I think that the case has been decisively made, and it was made again here tonight. There are linkages between Iraq and the campaign of terrorism against the United States. The Iraqis originate some of it, and they obviously cooperate and support others like alQaeda. You served as Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan. What do you think is the most important issue in higher education today? It's probably accountability for funds. Higher education is hugely expensive and there is a lot of duplication and inefficiency. And I'd go back to something that I've been talking about for thirty years: theloss of the primacy of teaching. Research is really way out in front these days. Teachers should be sure to take that freshman course [Literature Humanities] more seriously. On the topic of Reagan, there has recently been a spate of articles — from Bill Keller in The New York Times to Peggy Noonan in The Wall Street Journal —which make parallels between Reagan and President George W. Bush. What's your take on such comparisons? That's deserved, the New York Times piece that you're talking about. This is a bolder and more self-confident president than many people expected. More than I expected. He's very strong. And I would give you the Pope's words: the Pope says, 'Be Not Afraid.' Bush is not afraid. He's out there. The pace of world events has quickened recently, with a seemingly inevitable■ invasion of Iraq, the threat of mass terrorism at home, and the slow disintegration of Cold War institutions like the UN and NATO. What would you say to young people living in these very tumultuous times? The world is very scary now, and it's also unsteady. There are lots of crazy things going on. Hold close to each other, to your families, to your churches and synagogues. And eventually things will work out. This country has survived worse, and now it will survive this.William J. Bennett, co-director of Empower America, was a major player in the culture wars."
349,"DDC Course Brings Homer, Rushdie to Local Students",4 March 2003,"By Lucy Qiu Spectator Staff Writer■ High school seniors are participating in a modified version of Lit Hum in preparation for Midnight's Children.Few Columbia students would jump at the chance to take a threehour long Literature Humanities class every Saturday morning. But 23 local high school students have done just that. As part of the University's Midnight's Children Humanities Festival, the Double Discovery Center has begun teaching a new course entitled ""Literature and Humanities"" this semester for the senior high school students enrolled in the DDC's Upward Bound Program. In the class, students focus on Salman Rushdie'sMidnight's Children, in addition to Greek classics taught in regular Lit Hum courses at Columbia. The DDC, one of Columbia's community outreach services, was founded in 1965 to provide educational opportunities for middle and senior high school students at risk of not graduating. Through the DDC, students have access to academic tutoring, enrichment, and counseling. The 165 students enrolled in Upward Bound attend two academic classes each Saturday. The course offerings include a wide variety ofsubjects, from calculus to foreign languages to the new Literature and Humanities class. The new class is taught by Alejandro Marx, CC '9B, who is now a teacher in the High School for Environmental Studies in Manhattan. Marx has been involved with the DDC since his freshman year in Columbia College. ""The idea is to mesh Midnight's Children with classic Greek texts so that the students can better learn the common themes in the works,"" Marx said. While Marx organizes the class' structure and teaches most classes, members of the Core Team, a group of Columbia Core Curriculum instructors, occasionally visit the class to work with the students and lecture on Midnight's Children. 'The goal of this class is to expose the students to the kind of literature and discussion they can expect at an introductory college lit-erature class,"" Marx said. In addition, the class seeks to enrich the students' regular academic English classes and develop writing skills for AP exams. This past Saturday, in a discussion of The Odyssey, students talked about themes of hospitality, identity, and destiny—topics familiar to anyone who has taken a Columbia College Literature Humanities class. And like the Columbia College version, Marx's class focuses on ""the philosophical questions each text raises, and what the literature is saying about human nature."" However, since the class only deals with three texts —Midnight's Children, The Odyssey and Oedipus Rex —Marx can dedicate more time to each work. ""When I read in school, we don't go as in-depth as we do here. And I like that because it gives more meaning to the book,"" said Threnur Holman, a senior from Manhattan Center for Science and Math.During last week's class students acted out some of the scenes in the book. ""I hope they leave this class with a deeper appreciation for the complexity of the texts, and the ability to take what they've read and learned here and connect it to what they learn in their own schools and in what they will read in the future,"" Marx said. ""I think this class is a step for the students to being more individual, critical thinkers."" The class, which contains 23 students, started at the beginning of February and lasts for 10 weeks. Students are assigned homework each week and take a quiz at the beginning of each class. As with a typical college class, they have a mid-term and a final in addition to periodic essays and other writing assignments. The class will culminate in a class trip to a performance of Midnight's Children at the Apollo Theater at the end of March. They will be joined by other New YorkCity schools that receive tickets as a part of the Columbia Humanities Festival. In preparation, professors and instructors from Columbia have been visiting these schools to discuss the issues and themes in Rushdie's play. ""I think the Literature [and] Humanities class is a wonderful venture, and we hope it leads to further collaborations between the university and our program,"" DDC executive director Olger Twyner said. The Upward Bound Program is just one of the programs the DDC provides. Students enter the DDC through a rigorous application process in which they must show both academic and financial need. Once they have enrolled, they have access to Student Development Seminars, SAT and college preparation, and regular academic and personal counseling, all offered through the DDC. One program highlight is the six-week residential program on Columbia campus thatfeatures 3 academic classes, tutoring, a health class, special interest clubs, and trips. Another popular program at the DDC is Talent Search, which concentrates on college preparation. Marx says that, as he has been teaching some students from his class since their freshman year, he has seen them grow academically. He calls their class a true ""success story."" All of the students in his class plan to attend college next year, and many have been accepted to prestigious universities on scholarships. ""I think the DDC offers help on so many different levels for the students that the average public high school is just not capable of providing,"" Twyner said. ""We work with each student personally and really help them each step of the way. And for many of these students, coming from a background where education has not been a focus, we give them the extra hand necessary to get them to college."""
350,New Literary Journal to Give Undergrads a Scholarly Voice,18 April 2003,"By Rachael Scarborough King Spectator Associate News EditorColumbia's fractured English Department may have finally found a cohesive force in the new Columbia Journal of Literary Criticism, whose inaugural issue will appear on campus in the next two weeks. The idea behind the journal is toprovide a forum for undergraduate students to discuss literature and develop their ideas into scholarly, critical essays. It is also intended to strengthen the undergraduate humanities community at Columbia. ""This is a way to come together and create our own community,"" said Ari Freidlander, CC 'O3 and theCJLCs editor-in-chief. The journal is the brainchild of three Columbia seniors and one recent graduate. Friedlander conceived the idea for the journal last year when a friend had an essay published in the Columbia Historical Review, a graduate student publication. Friedlander then realized that there were few similarvenues for undergraduates and none specifically for English majors. ""People who love literature all around the school wanted a forum for discussion outside of the classroom,"" said managing editor Daniel Shamah, CC 'O3. ""People wanted to learn what other students had tosay."" ""[lt is important for Columbia students to have this forum] because there are so many undergraduates excited not just about their literature classes but about literary criticism more generally,"" faculty advisor Jenny Davidson said. ""I have already seen connections being built between students who have worked together on the journal."" Friedlander and Shamah said they feel that Columbia is a unique environment for such a journal because of the shared experience of the Literature Humanities course taken by all Columbia College students. Since the journal is operated and written by undergraduates,nearly all of its contributors will have taken Lit Hum. ""This appeals to something fundamental about students at Columbia,"" Friedlander said. ""We all have the experience of Lit Hum. This appeals directly to people's experiences."" The CJLC has already been the subject of tremendous interest, with 55 Columbia students and professors from as far away as India submitting essays. Despite such interest, the CJLCs path to existence has been less than smooth. When the four original staff members—Friedlander, Shamah, publisher Adam Kushner, CC 'O3, and editor emerita Stephanie Elsky, CC '02 —decided to pursue the project, they approached Davidson togauge how receptive the department would be to the enterprise. They then wrote a proposal, which was accepted, and succeeded in securing funding from the English Department. The CJLC also received funding from Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis, and then applied to the Activities Board at Columbia for official recognition as a campus organization. ""We obtained funding from Dean Yatrakis and the English Department thinking that it would help us be recognized,"" Kushner said. But ABC decided not to recognize the CJLC. ""They saw how well we had doneand said, They don't need any money; we won't recognize them,""' Kushner said. ""They gave the reason that we were too good, too organized, and too well-funded."" ""We're not recognized by any student groups,"" Friedlander said. ""[ABC] rejected us twice. It was very disappointing."" The journal's lack of recognition by ABC means that its future is still uncertain. The funding the group received from Yatrakis's office will only available for this scholastic year, and the English Department's contribution could be withdrawn at any time. ""We had enough money right away to consider ourselves a viable publication,"" Friedlander said, but Shamah added that the initial funding ""didn't ensure our long-term viability."" Despite their financial worries, the CJLC staff has high hopes for its continued existence. They plan to reapply to ABC next year and, until then, rely on their current funding and on advertising. Although they are aware of internal tensions within the English Department, the CJLC staff is not focused on resolving interdepartmental problems. ""We're not trying to solve anything big; we're not on a mission,"" Friedlander said. 'The English Department's issues are widely know and prolifically discussed, but they don't have much to do with what we do,"" Shamah said. But, Shamah added, ""by comparison to the fractured faculty, we're trying to create a unified community."" ""I think [the journal] is a reaction to the successes within the English Department,"" Davidson said. ""Lots of the essays accepted for publication were originally writ-ten for seminars or lecture courses. I think the CJLC augments an already, strong program rather than addressing problems."" One tangible benefit of such a journal for the student body will be in the area of resume-building for graduate school. ""For a lot of these kids who want to go to grad school, it really helps to actually publish something in academic journals for your application,"" Kushner said. For now, the staff of the CJLC will focus on getting its first issue, which is in the final stages of editing, ready for publication. The staff was excited to get the chance to interview George Plimpton, editor of The Paris Review, for the inaugural issue. The issue will also feature a variety of other writing, including essays about film and, of course, about literature. ""We're trying to combat the idea, sort of propagated in Lit Hum classes, that literary thought is, 'Oh, I thought this and that makes it interesting,'"" Friedlander said. ""That's just a starting point. You have to think about how your ideas relate to what has been said before and what can be said in the future."" ""What we want to do is take great pieces of literary thought and literary writing and turn them into literary criticism,"" Shamah said. Several English and other humanities departments majors said they are excited for the chance to share their ideas with the Columbia community. ""I think that it's beneficial to have a forum for student responses to and expansions on literary criticism that we learn in classes,"" said Mary Choteborsky, BC 'O3. ""I don't think that Columbia taps into its students to expand the humanities/English dialogue enough."""
351,Implications Does Columbia Foster Spirituality?,21 April 2003,"Does Columbia Foster Spirituality?By Kathleen Carr Spectator Associate News EditorT\he Chronicle, the student newspaper at Duke University, recently printed a column by Rebecca Sun, who wrote: ""I believe in God and the fact that ... every encounter is an opportunity to learn more about myself and my relationship with Him."" Although some Columbia students may hold opinions similar to Sun's, some on campus say that a column like hers would never be submitted for publication. These students doubt that Columbia would attract students like Sun, who would write about their spiritual opinions and submit them to the critical eye of the student body. But others feel at home in Columbia's spiritual environment, noting the numerous religious groups and fellowship opportunities. And some students —of a variety of faiths —believe that the presence of sacred texts in the Core Curriculum facilitates meaningful religious discourse. Within the Core, art, music, philosophy, and literature are vehicles through which students are encouraged to share their spirituality—or lack thereof. ""There are a lot of classes at Columbia that have the reputation of being anti-religious,"" said Benjamin Harbuck, SEAS 'O6. Chanani Gillers, CC 'O6, was offended by the disrespectful tone that pervaded a discussion in his Logic and Rhetoric class about the presence of religious texts in the Core. He said that students commented that studying religion is ""passe"" or ""old-school."" Harbuck, who will leave Columbia to devote two years to his Mormon mission starting next term, would be the last to agree with the idea that religion is a thing of the past, or the idea that the University doesn't provide religious students with enough resources to practice their faith. In fact, Columbia will grant him religious leave for the two years that he will be traveling. ""The University does support religious groups, and it does a lot for them,"" he said. Moreover, many students have had very positive experiences with religious discussions in their Core classes. Marisa Marconi, CC 'O5, believes that the religious views expressed by students in her Contemporary Civilization section are beneficial to the class's conversation as a whole.'When we talk about religious issues, discussion gets livelier,"" she said. ""A lot of people bring their religious ideas into the discussion, and that adds a lot to the class."" Literature Humanities classes, which include a focus on Biblical texts as well as the religious writings of Saint Augustine, have also received good reviews from some students.""I was very positively surprised. My teacher kept all of the discussions on a very respectful and evenhanded level. She made it clear that we were to discuss the texts as works of literature and works of literature only,"" Gillers said. But some students feel that the Bible is approached too literally in their Core classes. They argue that the discussion of it in solely a literal sense ignores the faithful foundations of the work. ""Classes like CC and Lit Hum ... are never taught giving a fair voice to the religious side, never showing that it can have rational validity, often belittling the ideas of belief and faith as if they can have little basis in comparison to the newly-appreciated secular approach,"" Jonathan Goldfinger, CC 'O5, said. On the other hand, many students criticize the Core in a different sense: they say that the classes focus only on the accomplishments of the Western —a sentiment that can lead to an especially harsh view of Christianity, according to some Christian students.""Students at Columbia aren't likely to express complimentary opinions about Western religions in general,"" Lynn Copes, CC 'O5, said. ""It's not quite politically correct to be a Christian."" Joe Ward, CC 'O5 and the spiritual coach of Columbia Catholic Athletes, agrees, and argues that, while criticism of other reli-gions is in all cases unacceptable, students and teachers tend to brush off ill-speech of Catholicism as if current controversy within the Church warrants taunting. ""Anti-Catholicism is the most widely accepted form of prejudice left in the world,"" he said. Because of what many describe as anti-religious sentiment on campus or animosity toward Christianity encountered through the Core, many Christian students have a difficult time adjusting to life at Columbia. ""I have no community here,"" Copes said. ""It's so hard to find people who are like me."" Some say that although the Christian community is certainly present on campus, it is hard for religious students to speak their minds about what is important to them, for fear of what might be an overwhelming anti-Christian response. ""There are very devoted, pious Christians on campus. But I also think that there are a lot of people on campus who are cynical of faith in general. There is a lot of opposition to religion, which makes it hard for the faithful to speak up,"" Katherine Dugan, BC 'O5, said. On the other hand, some students flock to Columbia precisely because of the religious community present on campus. Columbia offers Orthodox Jews a place to practice their faith within a large community of believers; similarly, there are several Christian groups on campus with hundreds-of members. The Orthodox Jewish community is noticeable on campus because it is so closely-knit. Some dorm floors are specifically reserved for members of the group, and most keep within the community for religious as well as social activities, GiYlers said. Most Orthodox Jews at Columbia know one another because many traveled to Israel after high school or went to summer camps together. In that sense, Orthodox Jews are distinct from other religious communities at Columbia because they have those experiences as a common ground, and a sense of community is immediately fostered on campus as a result. In the same vein, some students come to Columbia because the atmosphere is challenging to their faith. Many students are glad to have the opportunity to stand up for what they believe in. ""I'm constantly challenged to think about why I believe what I believe, and why I live the way that I live. Even though I sometimes feel very alone, that can be a good thing in the end because [students at Columbia] are coming to a better understanding of each other,"" Rebecca Andersen, BC 'O5, said.'A lot of people bring their religious ideas into the discussion, and that adds a lot to the class.' —Marisa Marconi, 'O5Jewish students take advantage of their large religious community on campus by dancing fervently at a social event in February.Intervarsity Christian Fellowship was one of several Christian groups celebrating Jesus Week."
352,"LitHum, CC Modify Fall Book Selection",29 April 2003,"By Kathleen Carr Spectator Associate News Editor■ Proposals made by Core faculty members will be decided by a committee-wide voteThe recently-admitted students that have dotted Columbia campus in recent days won't be as familiar with Raskolnikov or Elizabeth Bennet as the Class of 2006 is. And current first-years can expect to read more Cicero and less Hume next year. Recently proposed changes in the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization syllabi include the addition and deletion of a number of texts. The only definite changes have been moving the teaching of books of the Bible from Lit Hum to CC and switching translations of Don Quixote. All of the proposed changes will be determined by a faculty vote in the next few weeks. Every two years, two separate review committees formed by the chairs of each department evaluate the syllabi of Lit Hum and CC. Although the members of the committees are not announced publicly, they are typically drawn from a variety of ranks, departments and levels of experience, according to Assistant Director of the Core Curriculum Deborah Martinsen. The committees meet periodically during the year to reviewcourse evaluations completed by students and hear the opinions of teachers and undergraduates. At the end of the year, the general staff of each department convenes and the committees present the proposed changes to the staff for discussion, modification, and approval. Not surprisingly, the proposalshave spurred debate about which texts are most important to the courses' themes and objectives. In response to students' requests to eliminate repetition of texts within the Core, Lit Hum students will read Genesis but not Exodus, while CC will coverExodus in its entirety. In addition, Lit Hum will teach The Gospel According to Luke and CC students will read Matthew, since those texts are more appropriately geared to their respective courses, according to Martinsen. For the ancient Greek portion of Lit Hum's fall semester, the proposal suggests replacing The Bacchae with a different play by Euripides. In addition, the committee recommended that Aristophanes' Lysistrata be substituted for The Frogs. A variety of both authors' writings have appeared in Lit Hum syllabi since the course's inception in 1937.For the Lit Hum spring semester, proposed changes include removing Crime and Punishment from the syllabus and replacing it with two works: Apuleius' The Golden Ass and Goethe's Faust. Crime and Punishment has been taught in Lit Hum sporadically since the 19505, and it was recently re-added to the syllabus. In many cases, professors require their students to read The Golden Ass and Faust in addition to the required spring semester texts. Many who support the return to Goethe and The Golden Ass say that the proposed syllabus reflects earlier versions rather than maintaining the current departures. Both Goethe and Dostoevsky have been among Lit Hum's longstanding authors. Their works have been taught on and off since the foundation of the course. Faust was taught for two-thirds of Lit Hum's existence before it was removed from the syllabus several years ago. ""Neither adoption nor rejection of these particular alterations would run counter to the tradition of the course,"" said John Isham, a Lit Hum instructor and GSAS student. Students who have read Faust feel that the text, a German poem about self-discovery, fits thematically into the Lit Hum curriculum. But many students and Lit Hum professors say that Crime and Punishment captures the interest of a range of students and is worth keeping on the syllabus, regardlessof its length. ""Crime and Punishment is hard to get through in the time period that they give you, but I think that it is a book that everyone should read,"" Michael Dißiasio, CC 'O6, said. ""It would be better, I think, to test out Faust in a pilot class, maybe, and see how that works."" The Lit Hum staff will also decide whether to replace Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice with her Mansfield Park. Some students advocate dropping Austen from the Lit Hum syllabus altogether. ""I love Pride and Prejudice, but I don't think we get a lot out of it,"" Jane Parshall, CC 'O6, said. 'To go beneath the surface of Jane Austen, you have to have a lot of people who are really interested in it, and you have to have a teacher who knows a lot about Austen, too."" Next year's readings from Don Quixote will concentrate more fully on Part I and less on Part II than before. This change will slightly increase the total number of pages students read from Don Quixote, but professors hope that students will have a better feel for the work's cohesiveness. In addition, Lit Hum classes will use a new Don Quixote translation, as the translation currently in use is no longer available. Martinsen said that a professor from the Spanish department studied a new translation and deemed it acceptable, and Lit Hum will now use that version of the work. That change will take effect without a vote, Martinsen said. Another proposed change on which the staff will vote is the replacement of Robert Fitzgerald's translation of Virgil's Aeneid with Allen Mandelbaum's version. Cost is a determining factor in deciding which translations to use in Lit Hum. For example, Martinsen says that there is a much better translation of Montaigne's Essays available, but ""the cost is prohibitive."" The difference between the texts is 15 dollars, and the Lit Hum staff does not feel that it is fair to students to require them to pay so much extra money for a superior translation. The general staff meeting of the CC department was ""lively,"" according to Jeff Gatrall, a current CC instructor. ""It's great to see how each minor change provokes such animated argument from all the CC staff,"" Gatrall said. ""The result of these bi-annual reviews, I think, is a syllabus that evolves slowly, thatnever completely satisfies anyone, but that always preserves a diverse and extraordinary selection of texts."" The most substantial changes that the CC staff debated included adding Cicero's ""On Duties"" to reflect Hellenistic and Roman traditions and inserting Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America. Other changes include modifying the selections dealing with the American and French Revolutions (including the addition of a reading by Olympe de Gouges), adding an early text on women's rights, adding the medieval Jewish philosophy of Moses Maimonides, and adding Hannah Arendt as a possible concluding course author. ""The changes were, by and large, proposed by the CC steering committee and approved with slight modifications by the CC teaching staff as a whole,"" said Samuel Moyn, assistant professor of history and CC. The two most contentious recommendations, Gatrall said, were the deletion of Hume's Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, the removal of selections by John Stuart Mill, and the proposal to drop the first semester class on the New World, which focuses on readings by de Las Casas and Sepulveda. A small group of CC instructors vigorously defended keeping the New World class, even if that meant finding different texts for the subject, Gatrall said.'The fact that it's hard to find weighty 16th-century works by major European philosophers about the conquest of the New World doesn't mean we shouldn't try to devote at least one class to discussing the origins of colonialism,"" he said. Gatrall said that one of the most promising aspects of the revised CC syllabus is that instructors have more leeway to add material of their own choice into class discussions and readings. ""The same instructors who argued most passionately to save certain texts last Wednesday will continue to teach them regardless,"" he said."
353,Letters to the Editor,2 May 2003,"Lit Hum Curriculum Needs to Be Made More Diverse To the Editor: Literature Humanities needs changes, but not the ones that are currently being considered (""Lit Hum, CC Modify Fall Book Selection,"" April 29, 2003). Adding Faust and removing Crime and Punishment are not really big deals. If the Core Committee wants to really make a change, why not add something written by a minority? To me, the class is supposed to introduce us first-years to the masterpieces of the Western canon. But am I to understand that there haven't ever been any Columbia-worthy books written by minorities in history? That's pretty hard to believe. With Columbia spouting off statistics of how diverse the student body is to the hoards of pre-froshes, it surprises me that more hasn't been done to expand the minds of the students and make them more aware of authors who aren't European. Instead of reading the same stories that most of the students read in high school anyway, why not add a different perspective to the course? Then maybe the course will live up to its title. Lindsay Granger, CC 'O6 April 29, 2003 Spectator Should Be More Critical of Dept. Appointments To the Editor: Finally, the English department is getting seven new professors (""New Appointments Appear Promising for English Dept.,"" April 30, 2003). While it is heartening to hear that more professors are being hired, as an alumna and former English major, I feel these appointments and the way they were made must be scrutinized and Spectator should be leading the charge. It is unclear from the article whether the ""outside advisory committee"" was a result of the department's wishes or the administration's. My understanding was that Vice President of Arts and Sciences David Cohen effectively placed the department in receivership: the decision was not, then, made by the department to ""hire an intermediary group to do the bulk of the nominating work."" Why would the faculty, who have always been very vocal about their opinions, suddenly cede control to an outside group? Why would they decide to forgo a say in whom the University hires? The article also blandly states, 'To complicate matters, Columbia is one of a few institutions that do not usually tenure its junior recruits,"" as if this is merely a blip in the hiring process. What kind of place invests seven years in a person and then does not grant her or him tenure? Why on earth does Columbia continue to do this? Perhaps because tenure is expensive: fielding a large department like English is much cheaper with adjuncts and junior faculty. And why does Spectator continue to cast an uncritical eye on the English department? The article quotes only JonathanArac, the department chair, and a few students. Spectator needs to make every effort to expose what is really going on, especially for undergraduates, who are often woefully uninformed about what the department, and the administration, are doing. Rebecca Siegel, CC 'Ol April 30, 2003 There Is Enjoyment to Be Found Browsing Butler Stacks To the Editor: I enjoyed reading Megan Romigh's article ""Sunscreen 2003"" (April 29, 2003), but I do not agree with the second of these two sentences: ""Browse the Butler stacks at least once for pleasure reading. You will soon find this to be a useless effort."" I also didn't much like browsing in the stacks, not because of the quality of the books, but because of the semi-darkness. (It was, however, even then possible to carry the books to an oasis of light in a reading room.) Now, with the improved lighting in the stacks, browsing has become a pleasure. As for the books themselves, here is one browsing recipe that I have often tested. Visit your favorite title or author in the stacks. After reading for a while, take a look around and read part of a neighboring book by another author. Your second visit will then lead to your next discovery, and so on. Gradually, an extraordinary world will open up and become familiar to you. Elinor Robinson, GSAS Alumna April 30, 2003 Both Columbia and Barnard Students Partake in Theater To the Editor: I wish to clarify a statement of mine that was quoted in the article on independent theater (""Red Tape and Lack of Rehearsal Space Plague Student Theater,"" May 1,2003) concerning the Barnard Theater Department. The author quoted me as saying ""there is a theater department; it's just at Barnard."" I said this in response to the common allegation that Columbia has no theater department. This is simply not true. The department is a joint department with equal numbers of Barnard and Columbia students; it simply happens to be located at, and funded by, Barnard. While individual people may have problems with the department and the faculty, this gives them no right to discredit it simply on the basis that it is located at Barnard. Such arrogance and snobbery on the part of Columbia students remains totally unfounded, and is, more often than not, the manifestation of someone's insulted ego, rather than a realistic representation of the situation.

354,CU Prof. Barzun Honored at White House,30 July 2003,"By Isaac Vita Kohn Spectator News EditorEminent cultural historian and longtime Columbia professor Jacques Barzun received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civil honor, in a presentation in the East Room of the White House last week. Barzun, CC '27 and GSAS '32, was a pillar of Columbia's faculty and administration for decades. Colleagues and former students have described him as a beloved history teacher committed to undergraduate education and to the core curriculum. He also served as dean of graduate faculties and provost. The White House ceremony honored Barzun along with ten other distinguished recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ranging from professional athletes to a former head of state, putting Barzun in the company of such personages as actor Charlton Hestonand physicist Edward Teller. Current Provost Alan Brinkley said yesterday that he was ""very pleased to hear"" that Barzun was selected for the medal. Brinkley called Barzun ""a very worthy recipient."" ""It's hard to think of people who have had more impact on this university than he has,"" Brinkley said. ""He was and is a great scholar whose influence spans an extraordinary range of years."" Indeed, Barzun was an active member of the Columbia community for over 50 years. He began his long association with the history department as an instructor after graduating from the College in 1927, eventually becoming a full professor in 1945. He was selected as the Seth Low Professor of History in 1960, and the prestigious title of University Professor wasconferred on him in 1967. Barzun has been a University Professor emeritus since 1975. The history department is now home to an endowed professorship named in honor of Barzun. The current Jacques Barzun Professor of History and Social Science is Kenneth Jackson. But, Brinkley noted, Barzun ""was also a huge figure at Columbia in addition to being an extremely important figure in [the history] department.""Barzun was closely associated with Columbia's core curriculum. He taught Contemporary Civilization, and he was involved in the founding of the Colloquium on Important Books. (According to a College web page, Barzun once taught the colloquium with Lionel Trilling.) He was also involved in establishing and teaching Humanities A, the precursor to Literature Humanities. Barzun contributed to theColumbia community as an administrator as well, serving as dean of graduate faculties and provost between 1958 and 1967. To be sure, Barzun's influence extended far beyond Columbia. ""He was a great cultural and intellectual historian who had tremendous influence on the field for many years,"" Brinkley noted. ""He wasn't the first or the only person to be writing about culture, ... but he was one of the most eminent of the people in this field in the early years."" His influence was not limited to a scholarly audience. The text of the citation that was read during the presentation of the medal to Barzun last Wednesday called him ""an influential voice in American life."" ""Few academics of the last century have equaled his output and his influence,"" President George W. Bush said at the ceremony. ""And today he has the profound gratitude of his adopted country."" Bush also mentioned a best-sell-er published just three years ago, the most recent of dozens of books Barzun has written during his long career. From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life was just one of the many books that brought Barzun's widely acclaimed scholarship to a lay audience. Barzun, 95, lives in San Antonio, Texas.'Few academics of the last century have equaled [Barzun's] output and his influence.' —President George W.

355,Core Journal to Be Published Next Spring,23 September 2003,"By Morgan Sellers Columbia Daily Spectator■ The new journal will include exemplary student essays written for Core classesOvadia Labaton, CC 'O5, was sitting in the Core Curriculum office last fall, trying to switch his section of Contemporary Civilization, when he asked Professor Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum, if anyone had ever attempted to anthologize students' papers from Core classes. She said that no serious effort had ever been made. Now, Labaton is the editor-in-chief of the Core Journal, a new annual publication on campus that will highlight superior literary and scholarly work that Columbia students have done for the Core. ""The numbers are compelling.... There are thousands of kids per year taking Literature Humanities, and thousands taking CC. Even if only one percent are writing good papers, that's hundreds of papers. You can't even print that many,"" Labaton said. But Labaton also wants the journal to be more than just a showcase of student work. He aims to create an ""intellectual history"" of the Core.""We're trying to create an intergenerational dialogue and place current Core papers in a greater context,"" he said. ""The journal can be a time capsule, showing what texts were used and what people were saying about them. Papers change as the world changes"" The Core Journal has plans to publish annually, with three to five papers included for each Core course: Lit Hum, CC, Logic & Rhetoric (or University Writing), Music Humanities, Art Humanities, and Major Cultures courses. Labaton intends to find out if there are any assignments in the new Science Frontiers Core course that would lend themselves to such a publication. ""If there's writing in it, and especially if there's a fusion of science and philosophy, or other aspects of the Core, then we'll absolutely include it,"" Labaton said. Recent requests for submissions have gone out in e-mails from the class centers and student government In the future, the journal will ask instructors of Core classes torecommend individual papers for publication, as well as announce submission deadlines in their courses. The board is also hoping to get papers from upperclassmen. The journal has a submissions box in the Core office, and it is also accepting submissions through email at corejournal@columbia.edu. The deadline is Oct 3 at 5 p.m. The executive board members—Eva Gardner, CC 'O4; Rebecca Weber, CC 'O5; and Labaton —are in the process of selecting an editorial board from a pool of more than 70 applications. Student response to the journal is varied, perhaps based on experiences with the Core itself. Emily Kadish, CC 'O6, is anxious to read the first issue of the journal. ""I'm a Core junkie,"" she said. ""There are so many people that complain about it, so it's nice that some people admit to liking it in long, written form."" Cara Rachele, CC 'O5, was somewhat skeptical. She claimed that papers written for Core classes are not representative of college work.""The Core produces a lot of bad writing,"" she said. ""If [the essays] really were the best things that came out of the Core, then that would be interesting, but I wouldn't assume that."" But it is that same idea that the Core Journal is hoping to combat. ""If someone who didn't like their CC class picks up the journal and reads a really great CC paper, maybe it will inspire them,"" Gardner said. The three executive board members already have a lot of experience in on-campus publications. Gardner is currently the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Literary Criticism, and Weber holds the same role at the Columbia Political Review.But the three intend the Core Journal to target a broader audience than other undergraduate literary publications on campus. As Labaton pointed out, the papers would be ""in the context of the Core. [The journal] is about the intellectual history and currents of the Core. I hope there will be great literary research, but we're looking at a much wider topic range. Every undergrad in the College, and even some in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, can relate to this."" The journal has received some funding from the office of Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis, and it will apply for the President's and Provosfs Fund, which provides finances for first-time activities that benefit a significant portion of the undergraduate student body. Also, the journal is in the process of applying for recognition by the Activities Board at Columbia. In the next few years, the executive board also hopes to send copies of the journal to prospective students. And they would like to ask distinguished alumni to write reflections on their experiences with various classes.Currently, the only official support being provided by the Core office is the submissions box. However, Gillooly indicated that if the students asked for any editorial or technical assistance, she would do all that she could, saying, ""Student involvement, energy, and ideas should be supported wherever they can be. What I love about the Core is that all these minds are thinking about the same thing at the same time, and [the journal] will lead to even greater sharing of ideas."" - The journal's executive editors hope to publish the first issue in February, a deadline that Gardner called ""ambitious.""'[The journal] is about the intellectual history and currents of the Core.' —Ovadia Labaton, CC 'O5 Editor, Core Journal'We're trying to create an intergenerational dialogue and place current Core papers in context.' —Labaton"
356,PHILOSOPHY Phil Wallace Quick Takes On 9 Hot Stories Around Campus,2 October 2003,"Quick Takes On 9 Hot Stories Around CampusAs I look around campus, here is what I see: Story: Football Beats Bucknell to End 10-Game Losing Streak Take: This was a game Columbia absolutely needed to win. Can you imagine the strain Lions football would feel after everything it's been through last year—if the new Bob Shoop era had started 0-2 with a loss to a beatable Bucknell team? Instead, the Lions executed the two-minute drill perfectly, ending a debilitating 10-game losing streak. Columbia is now 1-1, looking good heading into Princeton this weekend, and some people are treating Shoop like he's our savior. Winning changes a lot. Story: Volleyball Team Struggles with Seven Players Take: I don't know if they give a Coach of the Year Award in Ivy League volleyball, but Monica Holmes should get some consideration. Holmes is in an impossible situation, keeping alive a program that her predecessor, Carolyn Elwood, nearly killed. If it weren't for a former soccer player, a last-sec-ond eligibility for a NYU transfer, a girl playing with back spasms, and the loyalty of seniors like Cassie Bryan and Meghan Feeney, the Columbia volleyball program could have gone extinct. I'm a little surprised that Holmes was not able to convince any of the girls who quit last year's team to return. After all, the football team got a nice windfall of former players when Shoop was hired. But I suppose it's better not to have volleyball players who don't want to be there. Story: Sophomores Upset About Number of CC Sections Take: What a surprise! Another problem with the execution of the Core Curriculum. This time the problem appears to stem from (1) Columbia's failure yet again to account for a larger student body as part of its ""enhancement and enlargement program"" (see housing, drastic shortage of), (2) its inability to hire enough qualified instructors to teach Core classes, and (3) a ""miscommunication"" with people who like to call themselves ""advisors"" by not letting these well-informed individuals know that while taking Contemporary Civilizations sophomore year makes the most sense in Columbia's curriculum, it's alright to mess with a few students' schedules and place them in CC junior year because of sheer administrative incompetence. I know this is not a sports topic, but it's an issue that matters to all Columbia students. Like many Columbians, I was attracted to this school because of the Core, and the belief that it would broaden my intellectual horizons. So you can imagine my surprise when I realized that the Core was executed about as well as the Jets run the West Coast offense. Some student leaders like to take note of the large number of graduate students who teach Core classes. This is a problem, but, ironically, the only good Core instructor I everhad was a grad student. The real problem is that many Core instructors are professors in fields that have little to do with the Core subject they are teaching and, more importantly, they may have little or no desire to teach Literature Humanities or CC. Their lack of enthusiasm and startling inability to relate to students resonates in the class, so discussion often becomes forced and painful rather than stimulating. I have written numerous columns about Columbia athletics needing to take accountability. It's now time to bring accountability to academics where expectations should be significantly higher. Alumni see Armond Hill's basketball team go 2-25 and they cry foul. If they sat through some of the joke Lit Hum classes we offer on campus, I bet several administrators would feel the Armond Hill-esque heat. Hopefully, new provost Alan Brinkley—one of the best professors I've ever taken a class with—will clean house. Story: Joe Jones Lands Third Recruit Take: We're not even at early admission time, and Jones has already landed his third oral commitment in Mack Montgomery, a 6-4 guard from North Carolina. He joins Ben Nwachkwu and Brett Loscalzo as Lion commitments. I don't know if Columbia has ever made this kind of recruiting noise this early. At the current rate, Columbia could open the 2004-05 with their own version of the ""Fab Five"" on Lee Bollinger's campus. Story: Kwame Spearman Tries to Start Brown Rivalry Take: Let's face it. There are only two rivalries in the Ivy League. Harvard-Yale in football, and Penn-Princeton in basketball. Columbia has no arch rival, but it should. Brown is a fairly good choice considering the two teams play on Rivalry Saturday to end every football season, and the schools' two curriculums are like night and day. But as long as Brown resembles a summer camp more than a university, and Providence remains the most insignificant city in thenortheast, the school is no more deserving of our attention than RISE). (Are you reading this, Brown students?) Story: Women's Cross-Country Hoping to Crack the National Top 10 Take: I have no idea how New York City became home to the northeast's best crosscountry school, but I'm all for it. Willie Wood and Craig Lake are two coaches who ignore obstacles, recruit top-flight runners like Caitlin Hickin, Lisa Stublic, Trish Nolan, and Melissa Stellato, and put up results. Story: Field Hockey Team Loses 20th Straight Game Take: What has happened to this program? Just three years ago, they were ECAC champions. Now they are mired in the same wasteland as the women's lacrosse team. Columbia needs to really examine its plan for these two programs. This school has been co-ed for almost 20 years. Yes, I know these programs are new, and I know that coming into the Ivy League for field hockey or lacrosse is like coming into the ACC in basketball, but at some point it's time to stop with excuses and win some conference games. Story: Polls Show Gray Davis likely to be Recalled as Governor of California Take: In honor of its 250 th anniversary, Columbia has been celebrating its alumni all year. Yet they have noticeably left out Gray Davis, Law '67. Davis, after all, is in charge of the world's fifth-largest economy, and has the opportunity to become the second governor in history to be recalled. Columbia should acknowledge both its great and bad alums. The very least they could do is rename the ""Mark Van Doren California Chicken Griller"" sandwich at Cafe (212) after Davis. It would be the only sandwich on campus to make sense (see Alexander Hamilton Mexicali Roast Beef). Van Doren is no saint, either. His son cheated on a game show.

357,New Windows Cap Hamilton Renovations,13 October 2003,"By Josie Swindler Columbia Daily Spectator■ The images of Sophocles and Virgil are gifts from CC 1885 and 1891, respectively.Sophocles and Virgil, immortalized forever in the minds of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization students,are now immortalized in two Tiffany stained glass windows flanking the lobby of the renovated Hamilton Hall. The large windows, artificially lit from behind to show off theirdetailed colored panes, are set into the walls on either side of the entranceway. Each window was a gift from an alumni class: Sophocles was a gift of the class of 1885, Virgil of the class of 1891. The windows were installed in Hamilton last week, as construction on the building nears its end. The portrait of Sophocles originally stood in the library of Columbia's midtown campus. When the university relocated to Morningside Heights around the turn of the century, Sophocles and the companion Virgil piece were also moved uptown. The Sophocles window was a fixture in the lobby of Hartley Hall after the building's completion in 1904 until Marcellus Hartley Dodge donated money for the renovation of Hartley Hall in 1948 on the condition that the window be removed. For the last half-century, bothwindows have been hidden in the depths of Columbia's art properties archives. Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley rediscovered the windows about two years ago when he was searching the archives for something that could be the crowning feature of Hamilton's renovation. ""Somebody said they had these windows in crates, so I said 'Let's take a look.' When I saw them, I knew we had something special,"" Quigley said last summer in Columbia College Today. Since Quigley's discovery, the windows have been restored in Jersey City, N.J. by the Rambusch Decorating Company. A Columbia alumnus oversaw the restoration, which included cleaning the windows, repainting Virgil's hands and feet, and attaching protective glass to the fronts of both windows. Since the works were in storage for over 50 years, relatively little restoration work was needed. The construction in Hamilton also included renovations to the Dean's Office, the Admissions Office, and the Core Curriculum center. Many classrooms, as well as the air-conditioning, ventilation, and storm drainage systems for the building were updated. In addition to the windows, the lobby received new marble flooring, fresh paint, and sconces on the walls. The University designated Hamilton a ""focus building"" within its decade-long renovation plan, which is set to end in 2004. ""We improved the places where students, particularly undergraduates, build their own communities,"" former Provost Jonathan Cole said last summer in the Columbia University Record. ""By investing in academic buildings in the current plan, we have broadened the impact on Columbia's entire academic community."" Student and instructor reactions to the windows varied; some praisedthe artistic quality of the designs, while others faulted the exclusionary selection of these two authors. Because all Columbia College students have or will study these authors at some point, they have been a topic of conversation for students passing through the building since their installation. ""I noticed them on my way to Lit Hum and thought it was interesting to see the stained glass of the same author I was learning at the moment,"" said Sophia Lin, CC 'O7.Others disliked the context of the works. Doug Greenfield, a Lit Hum professor whose office is in Hamilton Hall said, ""There's something odd about seeing the classics through the stained glass of Christianity, insofar as we're trying to not to read through [Christianity] in Lit Hum."" However special Dean Quigley might think the works are, some students remained oblivious to their presence. Nick DiCarlo, CC 'O7, said, ""What stained glass windows? I have three classes [in Hamilton] and I haven't seen them."" With Columbia nearing the end of its renovation plans, students have experience living- and working in buildings in transition. ""It was interesting to see a new perspective,"" Nigel Hamilton, CC 'O5 said. ""The entire renovation of Hamilton will take some getting used to.""It was interesting to see a new perspective.... The entire renovation of Hamilton will take some getting used to.' —Nigel Hamilton, CC 'O5The new stained glass windows in Hamilton Hall were installed last week after sitting in Columbia's art archives for half a century."
358,Books The Horizontal Mambo,13 October 2003,"The Horizontal MamboBy Mira Siegelberg Columbia Daily SpectatorWhat is the function of a sex scene in a novel? How many of us secretly read impatiently, and furtively flip pages in order to get to the steamier scenes in a book? How was St. Augustine's sex life? These teasing questions lie at the heart of Jack Murnighan's new collection of ""naughty bits"" from classic literature aptly titled Classic Nasty: A Rollicking Guide to Hot Sex in Great Books from the Iliad to the Corrections (Four Walls Eight Windows, July 2003). Even beforeapproaching the text of the work itself, Jack Mur nighan's tousled hair and come-hither grin in a back cover photo alert the reader that the substance of the collection will be as provocative as the author himself. Murnighan is indeed wellversed in the erotic story;until recently he was editor in chief of nerve.com, a website devoted to exploring the sexual side of literature. A sampling of articles from the website includes ""Prude Awakening"" and ""My Depressed Libido."" This new compendium is only part of a series on sexual fiction compiled by Murnighan including The Naughty Bits: The Steamiest ( and Most Scandalous) Sex scenes from the World's Greatest Books and FullAn Author Revels in Classic Literature's Sexiest ScenesFrontal Fiction. Classic Nasty, a sort of seamier companion text for Columbia's Literature Humanities course, includes erotic scenes from the Iliad, Remembrance of Things Past, Gravity's Rainbow, a Clockwork Orange, the Rig Veda, and Dracula, among many others. Murnighan introduces each scene with a witty analysis of the sexual ethic conveyed by the excerpt, and relates his experiences to the episode's theme.For example, commenting on a scene from William Styron's weighty novel ""Sophie's Choice,"" Murnighan uses the opportunity to discuss his dislike of the French kiss, and asserts "" The French should have kept their reprehensible practices on their own shores."" Later, in an introduction to an episode from Rousseau's Confessions in which the protagonist releases his frustrations by haunting dark alleyways and exposing himself to strange women, Murnighan gleefully muses on the history of flashing, and praises Rousseau for his candidness: ""Rousseau puts all his dirty laundry out on view and makes an intensely human document in the process."" Classic Nasty accordingly has the look and aesthetic of a novelty item, and one gets the distinct sense that it would work well on acoffee table—or in a store that sells handcuffs and edible underwear. Upon further reading though, it becomes apparent that the collection is not merely good kitsch, but is also an interesting and novel approach to reading. Murnighan begins this guide to hot sex in great books with a passage from Dante's Inferno, in which Dante places two lovers in hell for consummating their relationship after reading together. Murnighan comments, ""Paolo and Francesca's story dramatizes the power I've always thought books should possess: to move, to stir the senses, to elicit thoughts, feelings, moods, memories and even illicit kisses from one's secret paramour."" While the U.S Supreme Court has legally defined the word obscene as ""tending to stir the sex impulses or to lead to sexuallyimpure and lustful thoughts"" (People v. Wendling), Murnighan believes that one of the primary functions of literature is to be an aphrodisiac. It is not clear how inspirational Classic Nasty actually is, but Murnighan's project is certainly interesting. In one famous passage excerpted from St. Augustine's Confessions, Augustine cries out to God to "" make me chaste and continent— but not yet."" Like St. Augustine, who in Confessions brings his readers along on his own literary odyssey towards conversion, Murnighan takes the reader along for an autobiographical and deeply personal literary excursion into the most private of worlds. Classic Nasty, while certainly fun and irreverent, is a deeply personal memoir that proves at times to be rather moving, even if Murnighan never had the opportunity to hear a lecture from God in a garden in Milan."
359,Humanities Professor Honored by Core Award,14 November 2003,"By Matt Carhart Spectator Staff Writer■ Cathy Popkin was recognized for 18 years of outstanding instruction.Acclaimed educator and scholar Cathy Popkin was presented yesterday with Columbia's 11th Annual Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum. During the awards ceremony, former Heyman Center Associate Directors Carl Hovde and Marsha M. Manns were honored with room dedications in their names. The second floor of the Heyman Center was packed with administrators, professors, alumni, and Popkin's students for the ceremony. Colleagues delivered speeches praising the Core Curriculum, Popkin's teaching, and the two former Associate Directors of the Heyman Center. A reception for all attendees followed the event. Popkin, Lionel Trilling professor in the humanities affiliated with the Slavic Language and Literature Department, has taught at Columbia for 18 years. She taught Literature Humanities for many of those years and previously served as chairwoman of Literature Humanities. John Mitchell Mason Professor Emeritus Wm. Theodore de Bary opened the ceremony by commenting on the ""industry"" of teaching awards that Columbia gives but noting something ""unique"" about the Core Awards ceremony in particular. The first of three groups of speeches dealt with the Core Curriculum itself, the second with Popkin's teachings, and the last with the dedication of the rooms. Interim Vice President for Arts and Sciences Ira Katznelson led off the first group of speeches; Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley followed, joking that the howling winds that sometimes muffled the speakers were his due given his Northern England upbringing. Quigley said the Core is valuable in that it keeps ""the past alive byrenewing it all the time."" He also spoke in support of recent changes to the Core Curriculum, saying that these changes are necessary. Henry Pinkham, the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, spoke about the benefits of the Core for graduate student preceptors. ""One thing we have not done is sell the Core as training for our graduate students,"" he said. The next group of speakers praised Popkin specifically. First, Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum, said that even though students know that they may work harder and earn lower grades than they might in other classes, they always come to her asking to be put in Popkin's class. Gillooly read comments from student evaluations of Popkin's classes, including one comment that ""Professor Popkin is a jewel among the rubies."" Gillooly also said the ""Popkinian method"" of giving students response papers has become so legendarythat many other professors have adopted it. In addition, though Gillooly said she had worked with 10 chairs of Literature Humanities, ""none had been more fun than Cathy.""Richard Sachs, adjunct professor of English and comparative literature, commended Popkin for her teaching and scholarship. He closed by turning around to look at her and holding a book high in the air, saying ""Cathy, we raise our texts to you."" After the speeches, Popkin accepted the award, saying how Literature Humanities has become ingrained in her life. She shared an anecdote in which she scheduled alunch with a friend a month ago, then canceled it after realizing that the lunch time was the traditional time for the Literature Humanities final. A short time after cancelling it, however, she realized that the lunch date need not have been changed, as she is not teaching the class this semester. Professor Emeritus of English and Comparative Literature James Mirollo and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy Richard Kuhns praised Hovde and Mann before the dedication of their plaques, after which both Hovde and Mann spoke. A handful of students carrying flowers and congratulatory cards came to the ceremony on behalf of Popkin. All were enthusiastic about Popkin's teaching. ""Cathy Popkin is one of the best professors at Columbia,"" said Karen Weber, CC 'O4. Katy Sosnak, CC 'O5, agreed. ""I've never had a teacher get me so excited about what I'm studying. She is the most passionate professor.""'Professor Popkin is a jewel among the rubies.' —student comment about Prof. Cathy Popkin"
360,"Family, Friends Remember Pastron's Life",21 November 2003,"By Megan Greenwell Spectator Associate News Editor■ Jessi Pastron was a leader among her friends and an inspiration to those she knew.To those who passed her along College Walk or on the streets of Piedmont, Calif., she was the girl with the tiara, the bindi, or the purple contact lenses —or sometimesall three at once. She always had something to show, and she always had something to say. But to her friends, she was much more than her flashy appearance. To her friends, she was the leader of the group, the one to make them feel good about themselves, the one who taught them to stand up for themselves. Now those friends are preparing to attend her memorial service. Jessica Pastron, a Columbia College first-year, an accomplished pianist, and the only child of Piedmont's Allen and Janice Pastron, died Nov. 12 in her Furnald Hall single room. She was 18 years old. Although her abrupt death devastated those close to her, her family and friends say that more important than mourning is celebrating the life that Jessi Pastron —everyone called her Jessi —had for those 18 years. ""You couldn't know her—couldn't even meet her without beingaffected by her,"" one friend said. ""She touched every single person she knew. She was impossible to ignore."" Next Friday—when friends scattered at colleges across the country will return to Piedmont for the holiday break—they will come together to share treasured memories of Jessi. And for many, the day after Thanksgiving seems the perfect time to give thanks for her presence in their lives. Alana Dietze, a friend from Piedmont High School who is now a student at Occidental College, gave Jessi flowers for her birthday a couple of years ago. When Jessi received the flowers, she began to cry and gave Dietze a hug. Dietze said that Jessi's reaction made her feel good about herself. ""It wasn't a huge thing—they were like ten dollars,"" Dietze said. 'Things like that were really important to her.""Another friend said that Jessi's performance in a skit in high school French showed him how to liven up even class assignments. The two played a married French couple attempting to clear airport security complete with bottles of wine and bags of cocaine. ""She had planned it meticulously, to the last detail,"" he said. ""I remember we even made our usually inexpressive teacher burst out laughing. It was probably the most fun I've had on a school project."" Almost everyone who knew her speaks of Jessi's willingness to express herself in fun or unconventional ways. Her friends began calling her ""Princess"" when she would come to school with a tiara perched on her waist-length black hair. She would wear a bindi on her forehead, ""not just because it was pretty, but because she knew it would piss a couple people off,"" according to one friend. And she always had something sparkly on —often in the form of rhinestone rings on every finger. ""I had known of Jessi before I knew her personally—who didn't know of The Princess?"" a close friend said.Others reflected on Jessi's talent as a pianist. She had studied in France over the summer, and frequently performed in music festivals during high school. One friend said that Jessi sat down at the grand piano in Alfred Lerner Hall one day, two weeks ago and almost instantly attracted a sizeable audience. ""It wasn't just that she was good, it was that she exuded spirit even when she played,"" the friend said. ""Even if she was playingsomething really simple she made it sound incredible."" Friends said that her role as a leader of whichever group she was a part of demonstrated her desire to take care of everybody she knew. One friend recalled that Jessi would personally ensure that everyone had rides to social gatherings, saying that people often relied on her to work out all the details. ""One of the great things about Jessi was how she could be so adult and so mature yet still retain this kind of childlike silliness,"" said one close friend. ""She could be talking about in-depth politics one second and then start going off about the monkeys at the zoo."" Several friends from Piedmont said that attending Columbia was one of Jessi's life dreams. She had hoped to major in psychology. Since arriving in August, she had made new friends on her floor and in her classes and was becoming involved in the Hapa Club. Fran Pritchett, Jessi's Literature Humanities professor, said that Jessi had impressed her with her enthusiasm to learn and her unique insights into the material. Pritchettcalled Jessi a cheerful presence in the class who was not afraid to challenge others' opinions. ""She was alertly interested in everything that was going on,"" Pritchett said. ""I think she was thriving."" But Jessi's life at Columbia had only just begun. ""It seems so strange that she's gone now, because I feel like I had just gotten to the point of really knowing her,"" one friend said. ""She was just starting out."" After Jessi's death last week, friends and relatives on both coasts attempted to cope with their loss. Since news of the tragedy was printed in Spectator last Thursday, 120 people have posted notes on the online edition of the article, creating an internet-based memorial for those in other parts of the country. Many posts express sympathy for Jessi's parents and for her boyfriend, a Piedmont High School senior. ""She was beautiful. She was hilarious. She was talented. She always will be,"" wrote close friend Ariel Hirsch, a student at San Francisco State University. ""She was my friend.. .and that will never change.""'She was beautiful. She was hilarious. She was talented. She always will be.' —Ariel Hirsch Friend of Jessi Pastron"
361,"The Worst Poet at Columbia, and Proud of It",3 December 2003,"By Maxwell Foxman Columbia Daily SpectatorThe words of Everett Patterson, CC 'O6 and winner of the annual Philolexian Bad Poetry Contest, are delicate, poignant, perhaps a bit over the top—well, extremely over the top. Tragic and bittersweet, the poem pierces the heart of any lovesick Columbia student and is not terribly different from the sonnets read in Literature Humanities. And Patterson wouldn't want it any other way. Patterson is not the type of guy that you will see manning picket lines or center stage. Perhaps he can be espied rollerblading to class or participating in an avid game of hackey-sack. He does not enjoy the limelight or crave attention. ""I've got a big enough head already,"" he said, but considering his recent achievements, he very well mayhave to deal with the accolades of his peers. Patterson's bad poem, ""The Ballad of Sweet Donna Lee,"" whose title is based on the Charlie Parker song, tells the tale of Columbia student Maxwell, yearning for CU bookstore worker Donna Lee. ""Her cheek and her lips were a fine crimson hue"" the poem regales, ""And her eyes a shade of the most verdant blue."" He sees her and is smitten: ""0 who is this Helen? 0 who is this Adonis/Oh, wait, that's a guy, I meant this ... Madonna."" Maxwell desires to serenade the fair beauty and composes a ballad waiting on the check-out line. He momentarily falters, as all Maxwells are bound to, and laments, ""When she asked 'are you paying with cash or Flex?'/He knew, at that moment, they'd never have sex.""Distraught and broken as a man, he decides to take his life by throwing himself into the river at Riverside Park, but is accidentally hit by a cab driver named ""Jacob Mohammed Siddhartha O'Sherman/Whose race and religion could not be determined,"" and is brought to a rather quick and unexpected end. The over-inflated romanticism, the hyperbolic yearning of the Columbia student caused many to keel over at the Bad Poetry Contest and garnered Patterson first prize even though this was his first year of submission. Last year, after witnessing the contest as a first-year, Everett knew that he had to enter the fray. ""People go about these things two ways,"" he -said. ""You either writeabout something very serious in a real frivolous way, or something frivolous in a real serious way I just decided to do the latter."" Cool and confident, focused and determined, he took months to come up with the idea of 'The Ballad"" and typed it up the day of the contest, poised to speak of broken hearts, and the audience responded. Patterson seems to appeal to a variety of audiences these days. He also won second place in the Department of Housing and Dining Contest for one of his two submissions. Copying New Yorker-style cartoons that he says ""everyone loves,"" his creation depicted a man running down the garbage belt of the John Jay dining hall as a student places a tray on the belt. He also submitted another cartoon of a waffle iron asking out a microwave. With his long hair, demure manner, and warmth, Patterson does not fit the image of a typical funny man. His humility and self-depre-cating attitude hide an abstruse prankster. Over Thanksgiving break, for instance, Patterson and his friends from his native New Orleans were playing tricks on innocent bystanders in the subway, pretending to be strangers as they entered the cars and then promptly fell asleep on each other, slobbering on each other's shoulders to the passengers' dismay. He sayshis friends are what often inspire his creative genius, be it expressed through writing or through art, and that they have encouraged him all his life. Patterson is no flash in the pan. He has contributed much to the Philolexian Society at Columbia as the official poster designer for the club. His posters—sometimes cartoons, sometimes collages—show an appreciation for the arts and history. In his own proposed topic for Philo, ""History is Written by the Victors and Studied by the Losers,"" Patterson drew a cartoon comparing Elizabeth I to the nerdy ""Elizabeth Jenkins"" clutching a history of England. Philolexian members had only complimentary things to say about Patterson. One member commented that Patterson was ""the wittiest writer [he] had met at Columbia in his three semesters."" Another quipped,""What more could one ask for in this world? A colleague who can stand in the face of [my] vulgarity and say, 'You know something? You're decent.'"" All find him laidback and happy. So while Patterson would claim, ""the real hero is the poem"" about his recent accomplishments, many would beg to differ.Everett Patterson, award-winning poet and cartoonist, likes to play tricks on the subway."
362,"GSSC Focuses on Increased Housing, Creating Community",8 December 2003,"By Ciel Hunter Spectator Associate News EditorLike that of the other student councils, the General Studies Student Council's fall semester was characterized by a mix of smaller achievements and long-term projects, with housing, funding, and the 250 th anniversary celebration on the top of the agenda. This year, GSSC hoped to establish a more prominent presence on campus as it began to contribute funding to all the campus life groups: Community Impact, Club Sports, the Intergreek Council, the Activities Board at Columbia, and the Student Governing Board. One semester in, GSSC President Arash Yomtobian, GS 'O5, said that while there have been signs that GS students have started to become involved in these organizations, hehopes students will continue to take advantage of the opportunities provided to them, namely the ability to sit on the governing boards of the groups GSSC funds. ""[The changes] provide more opportunities for involvement and interaction for GS students,"" he said. And while they are funding the major campus life organizations, they found that there is still room for development. This semester, a GS student involved with campus radio station WKCR came to GSSC to raise a concern that GS students cannot hold executive positions at WKCR because GS does not fund Student Development and Activities, which oversees the station. Now, the council is considering pushing the issue of SDA involvement to the top of their agenda for the next semester. ""That's one of the things that weas a council have been talking about ... to see if we can have GS inclusion in SDA"" Yomtobian said. ""SDA benefits our students too."" But an even more important issue for GSSC next semester will be GS housing, Yomtobian said. ""Needless to say, we want to get more housing,"" he said. Currently, Yomtobian said, GS students who live in University Apartment Housing are spread from 110 th Street to 125 th Street, depending on where UAH has open space. GSSC hopes to work to establish space specifically for GS students, and in doing so, create a community of GS students who ""can live together and have that experience."" Council members have their eyes set on the building above Nussbaum & Wu at 113 th Street and Broadway as a potential location for such a community. Yomtobian said that housing has become such an important issue for the council because as more GS students enroll full-time, they want to live closer to campus. He added that many students are turned down by GS or decide not to attend the school because there is no space for them to live. The council will present a proposal on the housing issue next semester. GSSC will also be pushing for the redesign of the Columbia University diploma. This project, led by University Senator Matan Ariel, GS 'O6, was begun this semester. According to Yomtobian, it is now in the hands of the University Senate. Other projects that were begun this semester but are waiting to seecompletion in the upcoming months are a push to get more computers in the Lewisohn lounge to accommodate GS students who commute to campus. This is especially important in the summer, when GS enrollment remains steady, but many computer labs have reduced hours. The council is also working to improve alumni relations both within GS and the undergraduate community as a whole. Yomtobian would like to see students in all colleges have access to each other's alumni resources. GSSC members are also preparing to begin a research project to determine if by offering more Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities courses, or opening more sections of those classes to GS students, more would enroll. Finally, following in the footsteps of the other undergraduate councils, GSSC will be unveiling a new website after winter break. The site, designed by Chris Danzig, president of GS 'O4, is intended to be aesthetically pleasing—but not so high-tech that it becomes hard to use, according to Yomtobian. Also, like the Columbia College Student Council and Barnard's Student Government Association, GSSC will be entering the new semester with a new member of their executive board. A few weeks ago, former Internal Vice President Isabelle Hirsch, GS 'O4, resigned, citing too many other commitments, Yomtobian said. Former CCSC Liaison Richard Space, Jr., took her place. The switch left a position open, the SGB liaison, which the council is currently looking to fill.Q Student (Councils Recap Part 4 in a series"
363,Frontiers Revised After Last Fall's Pilot Proposed Addition to Core Curriculum Meets Mixed Reviews,30 January 2004,"Proposed Addition to Core Curriculum Meets Mixed ReviewsBy Morgan Sellers Spectator Staff WriterLast fall, a group of first-year students experienced what may soon be the newest permanent addition to Columbia's Core Curriculum. Now, the faculty members who designed the course are trying to make it even better. Frontiers of Science, which is designed to replace the current stand-alone component of the science requirement, ran last semester as a pilot course. At the beginning of the semester, 325 entering Columbia College first-year students were invited to take the course, and 280 accepted. The primary feature of the course is the series of weekly lectures given by some of Columbia's most distinguished scientists, which cover topics such as climate change, nanotechnology, and neuroscience. Likely lecturers for next fall include Professors Wally Broecker, David Melnick, David Helfand, and Donald Hood. In addition, there are weekly discussion sections of about 20 students each. Unlike Core courses such as University Writing and Literature Humanities that rely heavily on graduate students, the plans for Frontiers focus on the fact that the seminars will be taught by full professors and post-doctoral fellows hired specifically for the program. Student responses to the course have varied greatly, but most agreed that the course needed substantial revising in order to be successful. ""The idea of it was really good,"" Anton Glamb, CC 'O7, said. ""The lectures were really interesting, and most of them were really engaging.""""It's a difficult thing for them to do,"" he added. ""It's pretty ambitious to try to make a science class for non-science people. "" Izumi Devalier, CC 'O7, agreed. ""It's a great idea in principle, it just wasn't executed. Because the scope of course is so big, you'll never be able to satisfy the needs of all the students."" One of the most pervasive criticisms from students was that the aim of the course was unclear. Helfand, who initiated the current efforts along with Professors Jacqueline van Gorkom and Darcy Kelley, noted that on course evaluations the students' responses were ""mostly very thoughtful. It was clear that we had not made sufficiently explicit the goals for the course."" Robin Herrnstein, one of the post-doctoral fellows, agreed. ""The course we want is very different from the typical science course. That can be unsettling for students."" According to the course Web site, Frontiers is ""designed both to introduce students to exciting ideas at the forefront of scientific research, as well as to inculcate in them the habits of mind common to a scientific approach to the world."" Still, many students were unclear what exactly ""habits of mind"" would be. ""It isn't a definitive enough value,"" Jonathan Litzer, CC 'O7, said. According to Litzer, ""what they meant by habits of mind was basic conceptual thinking."" ""The exams were unsatisfying to take,"" he continued. 'They ended up feeling like SAT logic questions."" Eve Mersfelder, CC 'O7, disagreed, saying that the course had helped her learn to examine scientific issues. ""[The course] broke down the scientific analysis, and tried to present many sides of scientific innovations."" The professors are already aware of many of the criticisms of the course, primarily due to course evaluations that students filled out both mid-term and directly before the final. They are also planning on organizing a student advisory committee composed of students who took the class last fall. According to Don Hood, the James F. Bender Professor of Psychology, students were ""happy with the lectures and happy with the seminar leaders, but overall the course was not rated very high."" He explained that the lectures, readings, discussion sections, and prob-lem sets had not been integrated fully. Although the group spent much of last year and last summer perfecting the lecturers, they did not begin work on the problem sets until the course had nearly begun. Currently, the faculty members that were involved with the course last semester are meeting every week. They are reviewing every lecture, evaluating each reading, and reworking the problem sets entirely. ""We are going to consciously integrate the various parts of the course together,"" Helfand said. ""If the students had hated the lecturers, it would have been hard to fix —but they didn't."" Hood agreed. ""We have lots of work to do, but those problems can be fixed."" According to Helfand, at the group's first meeting this semester, they went around the table deciding whether to go ahead with their efforts. ""We had to prove to ourselves that it was a viable, workable model. In January we asked ourselves if we wanted to proceed, and it was a unanimous decision."" Despite the professors' perception of the pilot as a success, many . students are not so positive. ""Without dispute, the overall I sentiment was pretty negative,"" i Litzer said. ""A lot of frustration 1 came from the gap between how i the class sounded, and how it [ actually turned out to be. More than anything else, it was disappointing."" Devalier agreed that many students had disliked the course. ""I've only really heard negative things about it, but I actually sort of liked the course —I really liked the concept and the topics that we covered."" Still, she felt that there were still problems with targeting a course to such a wide audience. ""Not as in-depth as we would have liked,"" she said. ""It ended up disappointing both science and nonscience majors. ... People wanted a more meaningful experience."" Nevertheless, those responsible for Frontiers are enthusiastic about the prospects for next year. Helfand pointed out that the students, as first-semester students, ""haven't had experience with lecturers at Columbia,"" and didn't know what to expect. But without a doubt, the task that they have set for themselves will be challenging. Hood called the experience ""the most difficult teaching I've idone in 35 years—to distill the exciting part of your research into three lectures and also teach the ABCs of neuroscience."" Don Melnick, a professor of environmental biology, agreed, and said that the course would not be successful without a ""self-selected group of people who are really interested in getting people to understand science."" Kelley, who will be in charge of the course next spring, praised the efforts that had gone into the course. 'The professors admire and respect each other,"" she said. ""The interdisciplinary nature of the course is an unusual chance for science faculty."" But not all of the University's faculty are convinced that the course is a good idea. According to Hood, some of the largest concerns have been voiced by faculty in the math and chemistry departments. The concerns center around the addition of another requirement for science majors who already are required to take a large number of courses. Melnick expressed his disagreement. According to him, the addition of Frontiers to the corewould ""bring science more front and center as part of the personality of the college—it could become a signature program."" Herrnstein agreed, ""given that Columbia has adopted that model [of the Core]. For that experience to not include science—what does that say about the importance of science to the University?"" While many students are concerned about teaching science and non-science majors together, the professors involved in Frontiers said they feel they can succeed. ""It's the very rare first-year science major who has a sophisticated understanding of science,"" said Helfand. David Krantz, a professor of statistics, agreed. ""The difference in knowledge is not great. It's a difference in attitude."" He thought that the problem could be overcome, and noted that at Biosphere, ""science and non-science majors really appreciated having each other."" Devalier said that while the diversity of backgrounds had been a problem for some students, she felt that is should work. ""I'm confused,"" she said. ""Somehow itworks for Literature Humanities, or University Writing. You'd think, stereotypically, that SEAS students would struggle with University Writing, but they do very well."" 'They need to reconcile the difference that exists between science and non-science majors,"" she continued. ""I don't know if that's possible. People enter with biases about themselves —teachers need to find a way to overcome this."" While the Committee on Science Instruction has already recommended the course to the Committee on Instruction, neither the COI nor the Committee on the Core has yet made a decision. According to Helfand, those announcements should be made within the next few weeks. The current plan is for the course to be approved for the next three or four years, at which time there will be another formal review. ""It's going to take a number of years to get it right,"" Melnick said. But the Frontiers professors are already hard at work. In the words of Melnick, ""I can't imagine it not happening next year.""Professor Darcy Kelley was instrumental in developing Frontiers of Science, and will lecture next spring."

365,Course Books: Easy vs. Cheap,2 February 2004,"By Gautam Hans Spectator Staff WriterWith the add period over, students who weren't sure about their schedules now have the unenviable task of buying their last few coursebooks. With textbook prices climbing ever higher, students are going to various places to find the books they need for classes. During these shopping weeks laziness, embodied by the Columbia University Bookstore, is in a fierce battle with cheapness, represented by Dog Ears.net and other used book vendors. The easiest option for most students continues to be the Columbia University Bookstore. Affiliated with Barnes & Noble Booksellers, the CU Bookstore is preferred by many students because it accepts Flex transactions. In addition, the CU Bookstore offers popular boxed sets of each semester's Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization reading lists at a reduced price. Students who don't want to mix and match their Core books often use the boxed sets —by the end of the first week of classes, there are few left —to buy all their books in one go. ""I got all my Lit Hum and CC books in the bookstore's box set, because it was the easiest option,"" Sara Hames, CC 'O5, said. Students enrolled in engineering or science classes tend to favor the CU Bookstore. Nearly all science students who do not buy books online go to the Columbia Bookstore for new books, as scientific textbooks are usually not sold by independent bookstores or chain stores in Manhattan. ""I buy most of my engineering books through the Columbia Bookstore since it's the easiest way, but a lot of upperclassmen go online and get them used through online retailers or DogEars, or new at reduced prices,"" said Promiti Dutta, SEAS 'O6. For those students who prefer not to rely on corporate America —or those whose classes predominantly meet in Hamilton, Kent, or Philosophy Hall —Labyrinth Books, on 112 th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam, is the top choice. What it lacks in ease and variety Labyrinth makes up for in charm and personality. Tall narrow shelves overflowing with books, a stairway crowded with novels, and an eclectic sales staff make Labyrinth the most popular vendor for humanities professors, most of whom order all their novels, political criticism, and history texts from the independent bookseller. Labyrinth, however, lives up to its name with its confusing organization. During the height of exam traffic, when the staff rolls out the extra registers and the bag check doubles in size, an inexperienced customer may spend too much time wandering the aisles in search of a reading list. Labyrinth also does not carry books for most science and engineering classes, leaving SEAS students to fend for themselves. For students who do not go in for the outdated method of actually going to a store, Amazon.com and Dog Ears.net are popular alternative options. Amazon, the Internet's largest bookseller, often has humanities books, especially novels, for cheaper prices than any non-virtual bookstore, though finding the right edition can often be difficult. With Amazon's ""Share the Love"" program, a person can email an order to a friend, and if the friend orders the same book, both parties get additional savings. Amazon is useful for friends taking the same class who want to get new books for the lowest possible price. But the lowest prices are undoubtedly to be found at the inter-student online auction site DogEars, founded by Tony Vassilev, CC 'O3. From its start two years ago, Dogears has become the most cost-effective option, often sporting discounts of more than 50 percent. With so many alternatives springing up, it is difficult for any one bookstore to monopolize the course book market, and with the impending opening of the Morningside Heights Bookshop in the space previously occupied by Papryus Books, options for savvy students looking for the best way to buy books will only increase."

367,Lit Hum's Contemporary Value,4 February 2004,"By Marc TracyAssociating the required first-year Western literature behemoth known as Literature Humanities with the New Yorker probably only reinforces Columbians' worst feelings about Lit Hum. Unapologetically esoteric and erudite, the New Yorker is, as Louis Menand has pointed out, the magazine for people who are above reading magazines. And perhaps the most common criticism of Lit Hum is that it best prepares Columbia students for the very Upper West Side cocktail circuit whose members seem to comprise the New Yorker's target demographic. Those who call Lit Hum archaic hit home. Let's keep in mind though that not all Lit Hum works are by Dead White Males —after all, Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf do appear on the syllabus. For the entirety of their first semester, first-years read works exclusively composed by ancient Greeks, with the sole and rather unrefreshing exception of the Bible. And, of the almost two dozen selections in the Lit Hum lineup, only five were penned in the past 400 years. Yet a recent essay in the New Yorker demonstrates that the Lit Hum works are anything but out of date. In fact, Lit Hum may be the most relevant literature course a Columbia student will ever take. The first sentence of this essay, written by Princeton classicist Daniel Mendelsohn, reads: 'The early spring of 431 B.C. witnessed, at Athens, the outbreak of a great war, the commencement of a great book, and the premiere of a great play."" A Lit Hum vet could recognize that the war is the Peloponnesian War, deduce that the book is Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, and, if he is really good, recall that the play is Euripides' Medea\ the two works are Lit Hum standards. In the essay, Mendelsohn reviews Yale historian Donald Kagan's new book about the Peloponnesian War. Mendelsohn rejected Kagan's argument that Thucydides' account encourages an aggressive foreign policy. He instead proposes that The History of the Peloponnesian War teaches us ""that the arrogant self can become the abject Other, that... we must tread carefully in the world"" —a judgment against the Bush administration's perceived unilateralism. Mendelsohn goes on to criticize an essay by his fellow classicist Victor Davis Hanson in which Hanson employs Thucydides—disingenuously, Mendelsohn argues—to justify the war in Afghanistan and the larger war on terrorism. Further removing the debate from the merely theoretical, Mendelsohn argues that Euripides, responding to the same war, also cautioned against arrogance in foreign policy. Mendelsohn fantasizes that had the Athenian leader Cleon sat in his front-row seat at the theater of Dionysus in Athens and watched a perform-ance of a Euripides masterpiece, he would have perhaps pursued a less adventurous, more humble policy and thus changed the outcome of the war (in which Sparta defeated Athens). Cleon failed Athens, Mendelsohn reminds us; will today's Cleons take heed? So here we have ancient, supposedly outdated works being engaged on the political playing field right now—as effective a refutation of those who say that Lit Hum's works are not topical as anyone could muster. And this is far from the first instance in which these ancient works have illuminated contemporary times. The story of Athens and Sparta, two superpowers with opposing governing philosophies and national characters vying for predominance, should sound familiar: ""Almost as soon as the Cold War had begun, people who knew their history were using the Peloponnesian War as a lens through which to examine the geopolitical scene,"" writes Mendelsohn, who then quotes Secretary of State George Marshall explicitly alluding to Thucydides in 1947. I'll see Mendelsohn's Marshall and raise him an Auden. ""Exiled Thucydides knew/All that a speech can say/About Democracy,/ And what dictators do,"" W.H. Auden, who used to publish in the New Yorker, wrote in ""September 1, 1939."" Indeed, that poem, containing such lines as ""The unmentionable odour of death/Offends the September night,"" gained for itself and for Thucydides yet newer meaning a couple of Septembers ago. And it only begins with Euripides and Thucydides. If, as many say, modernism's birth was the advent of psychoanalysis, then surely all should join Columbia's firstyears in reading Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. Protesting an unpopular war? Then Aristophanes' Lysistrata—a new addition to Lit Hum this year—will speak to you. The Decameron, by Giovanni Boccaccio, satirizes the hypocrisy of the medieval Church; when first-years read it in the spring, cognizant of the Catholic Church's current scandals, its bite will be sharper than a serpent's tooth. Quite simply, the works in Lit Hum's roster, from Homer to Woolf, are the most influential, eternal, and glorious texts in the Western world. That alone is reason enough for all students to read them. But what makes the works of Lit Hum indispensable is not just their timelessness, but also their urgent timeliness. Their authors are bards telling tales of the past. But they are also sly Thucydides, revealing what is, and, perhaps, they are the shield of Achilles, intimating what is to come.The author is a Columbia College first-year."
368,Abe Handler LOOKING UP Dante Shmante and Other Tales,23 February 2004,"Dante Shmante and Other TalesNothing trivializes a work of timeless literature quite like duplication. What better way to demonstrate an agile mind and critical reading than by offering, ""Dante shmante,"" ""Hektor shmektor,"" and my favorite, overheard on the Carman elevator when the thousand-odd members of the Class of 2007 were in the midst of reading St. Augustine—""God shmod."" Indeed. We Columbia first-years specialize in this sophisticated rhetoric. While Lit Hum and its upcoming companion, CC, certainly familiarize Columbia undergraduates with the once-exotic string of unfamiliar names adorning the top of Columbia's veritable Fortress of Learning, Butler Library, many undergraduates have had lukewarm experiences with the famed Core. Don't get me wrong, this is not yet another attack depicting the Core as little more than a glorified finishing school for the upcoming erudite cocktail set —I doubt we will all stick to the Jesus shmesus shtick 20 years from now over cheese and crackers. Furthermore, I really do think there is something, as my Lit Hum professor likes to point out, ""core"" about these texts. Columbia College students should be learning a canon that amounts to the. intellectual ABC's. I couldn't conceive of leaving Morningside an educated person without having read Virgil—though, as a true Columbia student, I'll of course bitch, moan, and Dido shmido my way through the syllabus. Misdirected complaints and University Writing aside, there are some rather significant problems with the Core. Built as a series of small, discussion-oriented classes, there are disadvantages to the program's well-intentioned structure. First of all, Core experiences vary dramatically from student to student. For some, lucky enough to hit top professors in classes filled with articulate and thoughtful peers, the Core is obviously spectacular—small classes, top faculty, great books. For others, stuck in a bad section for at least a semester, Lit Hum (like University Writing) can be merely a necessary burden to endure. True, students get what they put into a class and a bad experience in the Core implies that the fault lies with the student. Yet, undergraduates come to Columbia, at least in part, for the Core itself. For the University to tout this central program, yet place freshman students in frustrating sections with graduate-student instructors, is unacceptable. While small class sizes obviously promote discussion, the sheer number of sections required by the Core inevitably stretch instructors beyond their areas of expertise. Lit. Hum. faculty already attend weeklyteaching seminars to gain familiarity with and join discussions on the material in the courses. Chair of Literature Humanities Dr. Michael Seidel explains, ""Expertise is not supposed to be the guiding principal of c,ore courses anywhere. The principle is exposure to ideas that are cross-temporal and crosscultural, and to discuss those ideas in light of issues still of importance in modern culture and civilization."" Yet—speaking from discussions with my peers—Core classes can devolve into narrow, short-sighted, and fruitless discussions resulting from a teacher's lack of expertise. I know, for example, that many Lit Hum classes struggled through St. Augustine because of the difficulties posed by properly framing the traditional discussion points raised by the difficult Confessions. A series of frequent faculty lectures would do much to improve Columbia's Core. The biweekly lectures could be given by Columbia faculty members and could present a basic introduction to the work being discussed in the Lit Hum sections. The talks could supplement and complement material presented in class and could be delivered by faculty members with expertise in the given field. Professor Siedel's opening Lit Hum class during orientation and the CC coursewide lectures are similar to the program of talks I envision for Columbia's undergraduates. With about fifteen professors speaking each year, such a program would hardly be difficult to implement. Not only would such lectures ensure that all Columbia College students are offered a uniform, enlightening, and well-informed experience with the material in the Core, lectures would enhance seminar discussions, make the names on the Fortress of Learning an even greater part of undergraduate life, and provide a desperately needed forum for each class to gather together as a whole. Columbia might want to look to Yale's Directed Studies Program, an optional course of study introducing New Haven freshman to the western canon for guidance. The program offers self-selected Yale students a large group lecture, followed by a series of discussion sections. While adopting such an approach wholesale would rob Columbia's students.of the small classroom settings that are central to Lit. Hum. and CC, a lecture circuit could supplement the Core experience without much cost or many other drawbacks for the University. We owe at least as much to Dante shmante.Abe Handler is a Columbia College first-year. Looking Up runs on alternate Mondays."
369,Silence From All Might Be Nice,27 February 2004,"By Jeffery StedmanIf one of our society's goals is to become color blind, we at Columbia are failing miserably. I'm not just talking about the Columbia University Marching Band posters, or the Columbia College Conservative Club's Bake Sale, or even the cartoon in The Fed that sparked the most recent increase in racial tension. We Columbians have trained our telescopes on the issue of color, magnifying it thousands of times, determined to focus on nothing else lest we lose sight of this important and divisive issue. Color blind? Not by a long shot. Everyth ng at Columbia is called racist. Literature humanities is racist, Contemporary Civilizations is racist, the proposed expansion is racist, the administration is racist, students are racist, professors are racist, and just about anyone who disagrees with anyone else on ' this campus is somehow racist, even if both people are of the same race. To say the least, it gets tiring to continuously hear that every activity on the campus is a racist one. A quick look at the club listing reveals that a large percentage of the student organizations on campus are based upon race: clubs for every race, engineers of that race, women of specific races, even religious groups that are race-specific. I can't think of a single racial group without a club at Columbia, except possibly Jewish Latinos who want to study Asian culture while eating soul food. I'm not criticizing these clubs, or suggesting they disband. I applaud their existence, but they are representative of an over-emphasis on race, and a paucity of interest in activities that bring people of all races together. Students, from the day they arrive on campus, are bombarded with the topic of race. In my first year, a fellow student informed me that I was admitted to Columbia because I am white, and somehow benefit from historic oppression of blacks. Last week, the organization Respecting Ourselves and Others Through Education held a discussion on ""White Privilege and White Guilt."" During the pro-war/anti-war protests last year, a protester told white students that they could not voice their opinions concerning the war because only black and Hispanic people serve in the armed forces and they are the only ones who would die. That is a paraphrase, but I can quote the response accurately from both sides: ""Racist! Racist! Racist!"" I'm not trying to pick a fight here, or claim that white students are oppressed in any way.I'm also not trying to defend recent events or minimize anyone's racial heritage. Ben Schwartz's cartoon was bad, but to call it symbolic of an underlying racism at Columbia is an overreaction. It was a misguided cartoon that may have intended to satirize stereotypes, as Schwartz has said, but did so in a way that reflected ignorance about both the subject matter and the probable reaction. Furthermore, it was printed in a newspaper that often relies upon the shock value of the hey-look-what-we-can-get-away-with attitude it embodies. The CCCC Bake Sale was satirical; it didn't differentiate between races any more than affirmative action does. If you didn't like it or agree with it, fine, but it wasn't racist. As for CUMB, just ask Fordham about the propriety of their speech. They have the right to say what they like, but they frequently fall into the category of being immature and provocative rather than intelligently humorous. I'm aware that this sounds more like a long rant and less like a deep analysis of the problem; but I've had it. For far too long, students of all races have hurt the academic and social quality of life at this University not only by playing the race card, but by stacking the deck with only race cards. The time for real discussion about race at Columbia is over. It's time for less discussion and less focus on this one particular issue. In my experience, the undergraduate student body is very accepting, tolerant, and racially homogenous. They're just tired of being endlessly lectured to about race. The actions of a few individuals, whether misguided, ignorant, or even truly racist, do not make the entire undergraduate student body, or the entire institution, racist. So, if you're just looking for a fight, fight against the few people who have provoked you. If you're offended, take a minute to think about who offended you. If you want to see a colorblind community, quit thinking so much about color. If you're one of those people who want a reason to recreate the 1968 riots, do it while I'm away for Spring Break. Just realize that immaturity and ignorance exist, that the vast majority of people at Columbia aren't racist, and that, while race is an important issue, it doesn't have to be the only issue.The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in economics.The situation has been blown out of proportion."
370,"SEAS and the Core: Students, ESC Call Foul",11 March 2004,"By Josie Swindler Spectator Staff WriterAccording to grumblings from the Engineering Student Council, many SEAS students feel they do not receive fair treatment in Core Curriculum and liberal arts classes at Columbia. ""There are a number of separate issues that are creating a negative atmosphere in the classroom for some engineers,"" ESC President Vijay Sundaram, SEAS 'O4, said. ""There appears to be a larger issue at hand that absolutely needs to be addressed: some engineers' academic experiences here at Columbia are negatively influenced by instances of unreasonable discrimination."" The ESC, responding to student complaints, has just begun investi-gating this ""level of insensitivity"" with administrators such as Eileen Gillooly, director of the Core Curriculum and professor of English and comparative literature, and Kathryn Yatrakis, Columbia College dean of academic affairs. The list of grievances is broad and unspecific at this point, but Sundaram said that the ESC will review and confirm the concerns ""very seriously"" after spring break. At this point, many of the complaints the ESC has heard concern discrepancies between the requirements for CC and SEAS students regarding which Core classes they must take, and when most students take those courses. CC students are required to take Literature Humanities during bothsemesters of their first year, and to take two semesters of Contemporary Civilization before graduation—the vast majority take the course during their sophomore year. Students in the' Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science are required to take one of the two courses to graduate, and usually take that course during their sophomore or junior year. Some students say that engineering students find themselves behind without even knowing it. Because most SEAS students who do take Literature Humanities take it in their sophomore year, they most likely did not attend or do not remember the first lecture —held during the New Student Orientation Program—which is required for all incoming CC freshman. In addition, CC first-years are told at the beginning of the summer to read the first six books of The Iliad before the first class; according to the ESC, SEAS students and sophomores are not officially told to do so. The SEAS students who elect to take Contemporary Civilization frequently do not have the background that Columbia College students do, as they have not already taken Literature Humanities. One Contemporary Civilization professor expects all his students to have read the entire Literature Humanities curriculum, Sundaram said. Other teachers seem unwilling to accept ""poor excuses"" for SEAS students' inability to reference Lit Hum texts, he added. SEAS students also experience adversity in non-Core liberal arts classes, the ESC said. When a class is too full, for example, some professors request that engineering students drop the course first. ""No student should be forced, or made uncomfortable enough through feelings of 'unwelcome,' to drop,"" Sundaram said. The ESC is currently collecting anonymous feedback from SEAS students on firsthandinstances of discrimination by e-mail and at www.columbia.edu/cu/esc. This information will be used to collect a general record of the SEAS student experience. ""This is something that can and should be approached from two angles,"" Sundaram said, ""both from the low-level 'case-by-case' approach as well as from the higher-level 'awareness and communication' approach to achieve mutually beneficial goals for both our students and our administration."" Gillooly said that in another meeting with Sundaram, she offered offered to remind ""teachers ... that not all their Lit Hum students will be incoming first-years from the College and that not all their [Contemporary Civilization] students will have previously taken Lit Hum."" She said the SEAS Guide to New Students, like Columbia College's guidebook, could contain a notice that all Lit Hum students should begin reading The Iliad before arriving on campus. ""My personal feeling is that Core teachers cherish the mix of students, though they may occasionally need to be reminded of it,"" Gillooly said."
371,The Last Word: It's the Other Local Bookstore,25 March 2004,"By Brendan Pierson Columbia Daily SpectatorEvery Columbia student is familiar with the Columbia Bookstore and Labyrinth Books, but Morningside Heights is also home to another kind of bookstore. The Last Word, located on Amsterdam at 118 th Street, buys and sells a sizeable collection of used books that are difficult to find at the neighborhood's better-known stores, and often sells them at much lower prices. From the outside, The Last Word appears unassuming. Tables by the entrance hold $2 bargain books; signs hanging in the window advertise sales. But stepping inside reveals rows of wooden bookshelves in a small, tiled-floor space. Well-worn books fill every available inch of shelf, often overflowing onto tables and into boxes. Classical music completes the atmosphere.A cursory glance at the titles reveals endless variety: Daily Life in the World of Charlemagne, Tuberculosis and Genius, and a Routledge Library volume called simply Curiosities of Literature sit almost side by side. The books are organized by subject, and The Last Word carries books on just about every subject: shelf after shelf hold obscure academic texts on economics, sociology, anthropology, classics, philosophy, politics, and science. At the front of the store sits an array of encyclopedias. Slightly smaller sections are devoted to fiction and poetry. There are also small sections for children's books and paperback science fiction novels and mysteries, as well as a modest selection of art books. But perhaps the store's greatest strength is history. The history books, which take up much of the shelf space, range from the American west to the Polish revolution, and are exhaustively subdivided by country and time period. The Last Word has been owned and run by husband-and-wife team Dondi and Karen Clark since 1993, when they bought and renovated the space. He graduated from Columbia's School of General Studies, she from Barnard College; both are longtime residents of Morningside Heights. Dondi, sporting a ponytail, a fedora, and an accent that immediately betrays his downtown Manhattan origins, described the store as ""a true community bookstore."" According to Clark, when he and his wife started The Last Word ten years ago, 'There was nothing here. There was no ceiling."" They built all of the store's shelves themselves and began purchasing books from both individuals and at statewide sales. Although the venture was ""fairly low-cost,"" Clark said, it ""did take all the money I had."" Dondi, himself an avid reader, sees his mission simply: ""We provide good books,"" he said. ""We provide a lot of out-of-print aca-demic books. There's no stuff like self-help books, or bestsellers."" Clark also added that the store provides a substantial literature collection. Both Clarks have a long history with bookselling. When Dondi was 17, he got a job working at a bookstore, where he met his wife. ""She was the girl behind the counter,"" he said. ""It's been her and books ever since."" Karen stresses the love of books as their motivating force. ""I can say that we have been very fortunate in being able to have jobs where we do what we love all day long,"" she said. The Clarks also talked about the process of discovery, and the thrill of the rare find. ""It's quite something to buy a copy of Montaigne's Essays at a used book sale, see nothing remarkable about it at the time except that it's a nice, tight copy illustrated by Salvador Dali, and then examine it a bit more closely in the shop and realize that it is also signed by Salvador Dali,"" she said. Karen Clark cites the company afforded by her line of work as an important draw as well. ""And, of course, there are the people,"" she said. 'They can be an eccentric breed, but most of them are the greatest."" Although The Last Word stocks books that can't be found elsewhere in the neighborhood, it remains less well-known than its competitors. Clark blames this partly on its location on Amsterdam, which Columbia students frequent less often than Broadway. Nonetheless, the store does attract a steady clientele of graduate students and professors. And undergrads? ""Some—the more enlightened ones,"" Dondi said with a laugh. But Clark said he believes that many undergraduates simply don't know that the store exists. He added that the store does stock some books needed for Core Curriculum classes as Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, often, he said, at very low prices.The Last Word, at the corner of Amsterdam and 118th Street, houses a large inventory of used books you might not find elsewhere."
372,Why Is the Core Curriculum So Eurocentric?,5 April 2004,"By Julie Carson Columbia Daily SpectatorThe debate over Eurocentrism in the Core Curriculum has never been hotter. Since its beginnings in 1918, the Core has drawn primarily on Western tradition to educate Columbia students. But after the recent protests on the steps of Low Library, which resulted in a group of students presenting University President Lee Bollinger with a set of demands that included a re-exami-nation of the Core with an eye toward its lack of diversity, we may be seeing changes to even the most fundamental Core courses. But still, there is no consensus on whether the Core should teach primarily Western tradition or incorporate non-Western and modern material as well. The main criticisms focus on the Core's lack of non-European texts and its alleged failure to address contemporary issues. Questioning the Core is far from a recent phenomenon. Its history has seen constant experimentation and overhaul, with a re-evaluation of class syllabi every two years. The Core introduced the Major Cultures requirement in 1989, while a course devoted to contemporary cultural issues disappeared. These reassessments have dealt with the perennial challenge of not diluting a coherent curriculum while still responding to an increasingly multicultural student body and cultural environment. Supporters of the current Core hope that the major departments will allow students to pursue a focus on contemporary or nonWestern cultural studies. But recent events on campus, including the Affirmative Action Bake Sale and the controversial Fed cartoon, have led some students to band together and demand that contemporary cultural analysis not be optional in the Core. Skirting contemporary studies, they claim, does not provide Columbia's student body with knowledge and awareness of racial and gender oppression. Student leaders proposed to President Bollinger the creation of a Core class to address ""issues of power and oppression in the United States, the process of racialization and the ideology of gender."" Their proposal recommended that a panel reassess the relevance of the Core to contemporary issues of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation.As for the integration of nonWestern material into the Core, one of the main obstacles is avoiding the appearance of tokenism, according to Classics Professor James Zetzel. Tokenism occurs when professors attempt to incorporate non-Western texts to serve only as a counterpoint to the Western canon, rather than analyzing them in their own context. The 1988 report of the Commission of the Core Curriculum headed by Professor Emeritus Wm. Theodore deßary found just this problem: an attempt to avoid Eurocentrism resulted in what was deemed a tokenistic use of non-European material. Tokenism, the report claimed, resulted from the syllabus' predominantly European content and from the unfamiliarity of many instructors with the material. The Core aims to reflect the knowledge base of the faculty en masse. But because of the wide scope of classes such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, the specialization of professors makes teaching survey classes especially challenging. Ovadia Labaton, CC 'O5 and a student member of the Committee on the Core Curriculum, cites ""historical inertia given that the Core has been around since 1918"" as a reason for the Core's Western leaning. A Western education will naturally turn out Western-educated professors, who in turn may only be comfortable teaching Western perspectives. This cycle reaches thepoint where many academes fail to recognize non-Western texts of comparable profundity and instead opt for the traditional Western canon. As one professor said, ""I would be interested to know of corresponding texts, but I don't think there are any."" Another obstacle to proposals for a diverse Core is the problem of time, according to Labaton. ""Since you cannot study seven cultures effectively, you study one and do it well,"" he said.However, the Core's Western focus reflects the comfort zone of the students as much as it reflects that of the professors. Michael Seidel, professor of English and Comparative Literature and former chair of the COC, said the material included in the Core is ""the basis of so much of what people know and think in this world. The authors you read later have read the same authors that you read in the Core."" Many people consider such afamiliarity reason enough to learn the Western tradition first. Students' general familiarity with Western culture facilitates their comprehension and analysis of the ideas. Professor Robert Harrist, who teaches Chinese art, remembers ""the immediate payoff from studying the Parthenon. Our everyday physical environment is shaped by this tradition, and life is more interesting when you know why things are the way that they are."" Labaton emphasized that ""Columbia does not need to apologize for [the Core] being Eurocentric; America was built on European ideas. However, we should recognize that these ideas often developed within an invaluable world dialogue, and those voices also deserve a place in the Core."" To a certain extent, through imperialism, globalization, and warfare, the bedrock of American ideas has worked its way into the bedrock of many non-Western cultures. The 1988 deßary Report notes the challenge in drawing a firm line between the European and the nonEuropean, citing the modern Westernization of the East alongside the influence of Eastern ideas on Western thinkers. Beyond its Eurocentrism, the principle criticisms of the Core challenge its relevance to contemporary issues and to a multicultural age. For some professors, analyzing ancient texts in the context of contemporary issues injects Core classes with a certain amount of vitality. Contemporary issues such ashuman rights and social rebellion ""come up in every text we discuss in the Core,"" Seidel said. ""Boccaccio was a social critic; the Iliad may be an anti-war poem. These texts last a thousand years because they are still relevant."" David Johns, CC 'O4, protests that relating the texts to the contemporary world is not sufficient. ""You cannot tell minority students that they need to take something and translate it to make it reflect their experience,"" he said. ""As a black student, my experience is not represented in the Core."" But tailoring the Core to each student would be impossible, according to David Johnston, professor of Political Science and cochair of Contemporary Civilization on the COC. ""[Classic texts] don't directly reflect anybody's experience very much,"" he said. ""Some students will come to the college with a stronger background in the material, but we cannot correlate that type of education to the race or gender of the students."" Some insist that studying the exiled and rebellious ideas of the past teaches the student how to engage in social critique. ""We give people the tools to talk about the particular by talking about the general,"" Zetzel said. To this end, the Core must be taught in a way that brings out current issues. Johns finds this approach too indirect. ""It is not enough to say, I'm giving you the tools,"" he said. 'The Core needs to actively take part in that struggle."" Harrist, who is also chair of Art Humanities, pointed out that the works studied in the Core present some of the most revolutionary ideas in history. 'These works are subversive, and when you study this stuff you become subversive yourself,"" he said. ""It teaches doubt."" In general, professors seem to acknowledge that social struggle needs to happen, but outside of the classroom. ""We can talk theoretically about how to ride a bike, but ultimately you need to get out there and do it yourself,"" Johnston explained. Zetzel opposes an explicit focus on contemporary issues: ""I don't think we should be teaching anything that any intelligent person can go read about on their own, or see in the newspaper."" So why does this subject keep coming up year after year? One professor suggests that perhaps it is because the Core is working: the students have become rebellious.

373,Staff Editorial Frontiers Needs Improvement The whole CC science requirement could use an overhaul.,13 April 2004,"Frontiers Needs ImprovementThe whole CC science requirement could use an overhaul.The Columbia College Committee on Instruction has decided to go full speed ahead with Frontiers of Science, the so-called ""science core."" Starting next year, all incoming College students will have to take this survey course that purports to teach modes of scientific thinking. Now that the College has chosen this path, it needs to make a good-faith effort to revamp not only Frontiers, but the science requirement in general. Frontiers performed dismally in its debut last fall. If the creators of the course wish students to get as excited about it as they do about Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, they need to broaden its scope and unify its vision. Otherwise, Frontiers will become the next PE requirement: a part of the Core reviled by all. Frontiers of Science aims to raise the profile of scientific ways of thinking within the otherwise humanities-dominated Core Curriculum. This goal is certainly worth pursuing: all students should learn to think like scientists. Yet in its current incarnation, Frontiers emphasizes contentover methods of inquiry. There is little express mention of even such basic principles as scientific method or controlling variables in experiments. It is not enough that Professors Don Hood and David Helfand, among others, teach well and excite students about their respective fields. What students really need is a course that forces them to think across scientific disciplines and draw something out of the experience, just as they might think comparatively about Homer and Virgil. Frontiers must also resist the trend in the rest of the Core to canonize works. If it does not teach current science, students will lose interest. The course should be a living creature, and its content should bedetermined principally by the forwardmoving research of the professors who teach the lectures. On a more practical level, the Frontiers pilot suffered last semester from being scheduled at 9:10 a.m. on Friday There is simply no excuse for putting a large, required class in what is arguably the worst time slot possible. If the registrar places Frontiers in this time slot next semester, many students will come to lectures exhausted and hung over, if they come at all. Frontiers has no hope of becoming a beloved course unless it receives a better time slot These problems are not insurmountable. With enough effort, the Frontiers team can certainly ensure that the course teaches students ""scientific habits of mind."" However, the remaining part of the science requirement—the twosemester sequence—does not teach students any such methods of inquiry, and it is unlikely to ever do so. Very few sequences appeal to non-science majors, and as a result, the science sequence requirement has become another necessary evil to finish on the way to a Columbia degree. Students in the humanities and social sciences often suffer an opportunity cost if they must take these science classes—in which they learn nothing of value to them —instead of courses that would be more useful to them. Surfaces and Knots and Mind, Brain and Behavior may be fascinating classes, but if they don't teach students anything they can apply outside the classroom, why should they be required to take them at all? In its ideal form, Frontiers would be a sufficient (and improved) science requirement for College students. Columbia should continue revising Frontiers and eliminate the useless two-term sequence.With help, Frontiers may be the next lit Hum."
374,Staff Editorial Calling All Accepted Students Seek out the secrets Columbia does and doesn't want to show you.,15 April 2004,"Calling All Accepted StudentsSeek out the secrets Columbia does and doesn't want to show you.To the class of 2008: you've come to Columbia this week to check out the campus and decide whether it's where you want to spend the next four years of your life. Over the past few days, the administration has gone out of its way to accentuate the positives and minimize the negatives of the university. Don't get us wrong—we love it here, and we think you will, too. But before you make a final decision, there are a few things you should keep in mind. Look at the housing options not visited by your tour guide. You've probably already seen Columbia's first-year dorms. Admittedly, the options offered here for first-year living are excellent, giving you a choice between the extremely socialsuites of Carman and the private singles of John Jay. However, you should also make sure tocheck out a few of the upperclass dorms before you leave. Look at the unappealing singles of Wien and the cramped doubles of Schapiro, and remember that the great living conditions of ""freshman year don't necessarily carry over to the rest of your stay here. Visit a Lit Hum class. Literature Humanities is the first Core course you will experience as a Columbia student, and it is imperative that you get a feel for what that's like. The Core is immense; it seeks to give Columbia students a strong foundation in the most significant achievements of the Western world in literature, philosophy, history, art, and music, as well as an understanding of the sciences and non-Western cultures. If you don't want to be compelled to have a well-founded education, Columbia simply isn't the school for you. We recommend joining the other stoners and burnouts at Brown. Just remember, Brown is in Providence, R.I.You don't want to spend four years in Providence. Check out the West End. Yes, you're in New York City. Yes, the city gives you the opportunity to expand your horizons and sample the best entertainment in the world. However, if you're like most students, you'll end up spending more time at the local bars than at the Met. The 'Stend has a rich tradition of taking in Columbia first-years and getting them good and plastered, plus a more dignified history: Ginsberg and Kerouac used to read poetry there. Take a look around, and see if you can imagine making it your local watering hole—after y©u turn 21, of course. Don't bother stopping in at any of theadvising centers. Columbia is not a school that is willing to hold your hand, and our advising system is notoriouslypoor. Furthermore, the structure of the system dictates that students switch from advisors after their sophomore year. Both of these advisors, by the way, ""serve"" between 200 and 400 advisees. This can become problematic, especially given the intricacies of the Core Curriculum. If you aren't independent enough to handle it, you should probably look elsewhere. Finally, don't waste your time visiting Columbia's graduate schools. While you may dream of one day obtaining a degree from our law, journalism, or business schools, chances are you won't spend any time there during your undergraduate years. And it should be noted that the School of International and Public Affairs bears a striking resemblance to a.Sovietstyle gulag. Good luck with your decision. Just remember: Ivy League education, greatest city in the world. It doesn't get better than that.If you don't like the Core, take a rain check."
375,"Strike for Graduate Student Union Begins University Urges Profs to Expedite Senior Grades, Teach Core Classes",19 April 2004,"University Urges Profs to Expedite Senior Grades, Teach Core ClassesBy Rebecca Aronauer Spectator Staff WriterFor many underclassmen, today—the first day of the graduate student strike—may feel like a snow day. Striking graduate students teaching subjects like Lit. Hum., Contemporary Civilization, Art Hum., Music Hum., University Writing, and languages are indefinitely canceling their meetings. But for administrators worried about keeping the University running without TAs, and seniors concerned about receiving this semester's credit in time for graduation, today and the coming weeks have none of the usual relief of a day off from school. Last Wednesday and Thursday, 80 percent of participating Graduate Student Employees United teaching assistants and research assistants voted to go on strike indefinitely unless Columbia recognizes GSEU as a union. There has been no communication between the administration and the strike organizers since GSEU claimed a majority three weeks ago, when State Senator David A. Paterson counted union authorization cards. As GSEU members scramble to make signs and write chants for the next several weeks of protests, the University has begun to prepare for life and finals without teaching assistants. It is unclear just how long the strike will last because University Provost Alan Brinkley has said theUniversity will wait through the strike for the National Labor Relations Board ruling on their 2002 appeal, which has delayed the counting of graduate student and undergraduate teaching assistants' ballots for two years. ""If the strike goes past graduation, we'll continue the campaign in the fall. How it continues will be dependent on a lot of different factors, but it will continue,"" said David Carpio, a former graduate student at Columbia and GSEU spokesman. Whenever they return, the graduate students have said they will not grade the papers and exams they missed during their strike. ""If we decide to end the strike in the summer, we're not going to make up struck work,"" said Maurice Leutenger, GSEU member and physics graduate student. Administrators expect a National Labor Relations Board decision on Columbia's 2002 appeal. ""I would hope that we have an NLRB ruling before the end of the summer and that might be a basis for bringing this to an end,"" Brinkley said. This January, President Bush filled the NLRB's formerly vacant fifth seat. David Parker, the board's deputy executive secretary, told The New York Times this weekend that the case will be decided in a matter of months. Since the NLRB has yet to rule, Brinkley posted a list of guidelines for the strike on the Columbia University homepage Friday afternoon. The general guidelines, which were reword-Ed over the weekend, give professors extensions for handing in underclassmen's grades, but instruct professors to submit grades for seniors with enough time for them to be eligible to graduate—about three to four days before commencement. Professors of large lectures will be given extra time to submit underclassmen's grades. ""It is the absolute expectation of the University that all seniors will get their grades for graduation. We will not accept a faculty member saying 'I can't get these grades in before commencement,'"" Brinkley said.The University's commitment to maintaining letter grades for all students during the strike will create a heavy burden for professors of large lectures. In a class like U.S. Era of Reconstruction and Civil War, a 182-person lecture with a majority of the seven TAs striking, professor Eric Foner faces the daunting task of grading 182 papers and finals with the help of only a few TAs. ""That means that I will concentrate on the seniors and then I will deal with the others in due course,"" Foner said. Some faculty members feel that the administration's effortsto minimize the academic effect on students will prevent the strike from effectively impeding the normal functioning of the University, and will instead place the burden on professors. ""While I support the union's aspirations, it is hard to sympathize with a strategy that, given the administration's insistence on the submission of grades no matter what, places all the burden of the strike on faculty innocent of the dispute who may have no ability to pressure either side to reach a fair resolution,"" a junior faculty member wrote in an e-mail. The administration's posting made no reference to how the University and registrar will deal with Core and language classes, many sections of which are taught by TAs. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization directors, as well as music, art history, and language department heads, have asked faculty members to take over the classes of striking TAs on an ""ad-comp"" basis —faculty will be given undisclosed sums for taking on the classes of striking graduate students. When or if these professors will start teaching is unknown; the plan is still tentative. Further complicating matters, GSEU has not released a list of striking graduate students. ""No union member needs to inform their superiors that they're going to be on strike,"" said Jennifer Frank, a fifth-year graduate student who teaches University Writing. Brinkley does not think the ad-comp policy can be implemented for University Writing,the first-year writing class taught almost exclusively by TAs. 'Those [University Writing] classes undoubtedly will not meet,"" he said. The University is unsure how many classes need to be filled. ""If we can cover classes and keep them going, we should. If we can't, they don't meet,"" Brinkley said. Directors and department heads of the Core will decide if classes taught by striking TAs will have finals this semester. The provost has told department heads they can pursue any legal path to finishing this semester, including compiling current marks to create a final grade for an entire Core class. ""The only option that is not available is not to give final grades,"" Brinkley said. Striking graduate students are required to return grades collected over the semester to the heads of their departments. Presumably, faculty heads and Core course administrators will compute grades for students of striking graduate students. The strike may also affect small classes taught by professors. Last Friday, 45 professors signed a letter to President Bollinger urging him to determine if a majority of teaching and research assistants want a union or to withdraw the University's appeal to the NLRB. Some professors will show their support for the strikers by holding class off-campus. The University will not arrange these room changes because of liability issues, but will publicize alternate locations for interested faculty.' [University Writing] classes undoubtedly will not meet.' —Alan Brinkley University Provost"
376,"Strike Begins; 400 Picket on Day One Few Classes Canceled by Graduate Student Strike, But Organizers Enthused",20 April 2004,"Few Classes Canceled by Graduate Student Strike, But Organizers EnthusedBy Rebecca Aronauer and Morgan Sellers Spectator Staff WritersThe shrill whistles and drum beats of the Graduate Student Employees United picket line woke residents on 116 th Street yesterday morning, as hundreds of graduate students, undergraduates, and supporters marched outside Columbia University's Broadway gates demanding union recognition for research and teaching assistants. But after the first day of the indefinite strike, the effects on undergraduate classes remained unclear. The picket lines lasted from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. A New York Police Department officer estimated that 400 to 500 marched over the course of the morning. At noon, members of various other unions on campus joined the picket lines, and the strikers then marched in the gates and around campus. Strike organizers said they were pleased with the turnout. ""For the first day of the strike, it was great,"" said David Carpio, GSEU spokesman and former Columbia graduate student. ""I think the rally we had at the end really energized the teaching and research assistants. We're ready for day two."" Inside the gates, however, it was difficult to determine the extent of the strike's effect. Many department chairs are asking TAs to notify them if they will be striking, but many had not yet responded. The number of cancelled sections of core classes appeared low, but no numbers were available from University Writing, the class that administrators and the Core office estimated would be most affected. No Monday/Wednesday Music Humanities sections were canceled because of the strike, and only a few Art Humanities sections were canceled yesterday afternoon. Finals for all core classes will be held. Art Humanities director Robert Harrist does not know precisely howmany Tuesday/Thursday sections will meet, but thinks the number will be high. ""For tomorrow, I think it's looking pretty good,"" he said. Only three of 23 Literature Humanities precepts are confirmed as striking, but four have not responded to Core Director Eileen Gillooly's inquiries. Contemporary Civilization has had higher returns: there are four definite striking precepts of 23 and Gillooly is waiting to hear back from eight others. The administration and directors had little time to make alternate arrangements for the strike; three days after the results of the vote were announced, the graduate students went on strike. But Gillooly does not think more time would have made a difference. ""Strikes are intended to inconvenience. I'm not sure whether there is ever enough time to plan effectively for a strike,"" Gillooly wrote in an email. First-years, who tend to take the most courses taught by precepts, like core and language classes, will likely be most affected by the strike. Dahlia Runco, CC 'O7, had two classes canceled: Italian and University Writing. While she said she appreciates the unanticipated free time, she is worried about how the strike will leave her class unprepared for exams. ""I'm glad that we have time off, but it puts us at a disadvantage for the final,"" Runco said. Many of the strikers expressed similar regrets about canceling classes. Susan Kart, a graduate student in the Art History department will not teach her Art Humanities class for the duration of the strike. ""I started talking to my class last week about contingency plans,"" she said. ""A lot of the students told me that they were concerned about missing class. I told them that we are all disappointed too ... I'd rather be in class teaching Picasso."" But she, along with hundreds of other teaching and research assistants, demonstrated that the issues at stake were important enough to justify their actions. Many of those walking the picket line said that one of their most important reasons for striking was showing support of their fellow graduate students. Zane Mackin, a second-year graduate student in the Italian department, said that he had a good relationship with the Italian department, and was uncertain about a union before considering its poten-tial benefits to other graduate students. ""Of course I feel ambivalent, because I can make ends meet,"" he explained. But he said that many graduate students had to work extra jobs in order to cover their living expenses and that there were no guarantees regarding stipends, health benefits, or other aspects of graduate student life. Mackin also said that he was concerned about what he perceived as an increasing corporate atmosphere at Columbia. ""There isn't a lot of space for free intellectual exercise anymore,"" he said. Many of the protesters carried signs picturing Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Henry Pinkham, and included a quote from a meeting with English graduate students in which he called GSAS a ""moneysink."" ""It's telling that he's using the terms of the corporation rather than the terms of the university,"" Mackin said. ""What he calls a sinkhole, we call a salary."" But some fear that a union would only hurt the relationship betweengraduate students and faculty. ""Another level of bureaucracy is the last thing in the world that Columbia needs,"" Paul Sheehan, a third-year graduate student in the Music department said. Sheehan, who is continuing to teach his Music Humanities class, said that GSEU had not adequately addressed the effects of a union on the ""intangibles"" of graduate student studies. ""I don't know if a union would be good for us or not,"" Sheehan said, ""but I doubt the sincerity of the union."" Other students are convinced that a union would not be appropriate at Columbia. Adam Meshel, a fifth-year graduate student in the Biological Sciences department, was one of the organizers for Graduate Students Against Unionization, a student group that campaigned opposite GSEU during the debates leading up to the unionization vote two years ago. ""How can you take the concern of a student who is in the English department and compare it with someone in biology?"" he asked. 'To think that you can write a contract that can address all those needs is asking too much."" But Meshel agreed that the votes from two years ago should have been counted. ""We're just as upset at the University for locking up those votes as GSEU is,"" he said. ""If it turned out that the vote had gone infavor of a union, I would back up 100 percent."" GSEU last talked to Senior Executive Vice President Robert Kasdin nine months ago about the University dropping the appeal to the National Labor Relationship Board that has prevented the 2002 ballots from being counted. President Lee Bollinger did not reply to State Senator David Paterson's letter confirming that a majority of TAs and RAs had signed union authorization cards and asking the University to withdraw its appeal. Provost Alan Brinkley did try to set up an appointment with the senator, but no meeting materialized. The administration did not realize that after Paterson's letter, GSEU's next step would be a strike. ""I realized that the issue would become a live issue again on campus. There was nothing in the letter to suggest a strike. I just didn't think this was the likely result,"" Brinkleysaid. After the first day of striking, there are no plans for a meeting between the administration and GSEU. Administrators have already rejected GSEU's demands for union recognition, a third party union authorization card count or withdrawing their appeal to the NLRB. ""We're not really in a negotiation situation. The union is asking that we drop our appeal and that's not something the administration is willing to do,"" Brinkley said. ""There's no middle ground between these positions."" Brinkley said that if approached, the administration would be willing to talk to GSEU and is waiting for them to end the strike. ""It's their decision,"" he said. However, GSEU organizers hope that the strike will convince the University to reevaluate its position. The picket line will continue today, and on Wednesday the undergraduate group Students for Environmental and Economic Justice is calling for a school wide boycott of classes and a rally on the Low steps at noon.'Another level of bureaucracy is the last thing in the world that Columbia needs.' —Paul Sheehan Third-year graduate studentWith forces that numbered from around 100 to 200 people at any given time during the day, striking graduate students marched across campus in a demonstration against the University. Various departments including anthropology, mathematics, and English and comparative literature were represented in the brightly colored signs carried by students who quoted everyone from Immanuel Kant to Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Henry Pinkham. The protesters plan to return to the picket lines tomorrow morning and continue indefinitely."
377,GSEU Picketing Continues Undergraduate Walkout and Rally to Take Place on Low Steps at Noon,21 April 2004,"Undergraduate Walkout and Rally to Take Place on Low Steps at NoonBy Morgan Sellers Spectator Staff WriterThe striking graduate students began to settle in for the long haul yesterday as they protested on College Walk, in sharp contrast to the students and teachers who lounged on the steps of Low Library enjoying the warm Spring weather.Between 60 and 80 teaching and research assistants joined the picket lines yesterday. The turnout corresponded to the participation level that strike organizers expected to see over the long term. ""If everyone showed up all day, every day, we wouldn't last very long,"" said David Carpio, an organizer for the Graduate Student Employees Unite, the organization that is calling for the strike. The effect of the strike onundergraduate classes remains unclear. Carpio said that the total number of striking graduate students will not be known for at least a week. According to Eileen Gilooly, the director of the Core, four Literature Humanities teaching assistants and eight graduate student Contemporary Civilizations teachers are currently on strike. Yesterday, Dean Chris Colombo e-mailed the families of undergraduates, informingthem that the University was taking the necessary steps to ensure ""that students are able to complete the semester."" An undergraduate walk-out and rally organized by the Students for Environmental and Economic Justice will cause the effects of the strike to become increasingly apparent today. The rally will take place at noon on Low Steps. Meanwhile, the debate that began over two years ago about the benefits of unionization at Columbia Continues. Some of the teaching and research assistants that are not striking emphasized the point that GSEU was only representing a portion of the graduate students. ""Not everyone is in favor of the union,"" said Johanna Seasonwein, a third year graduate student in Art History. ""It's very important to me to say that I don't agree."" ""I don't see a role for unions at universities,"" she said. ""I feel very strongly that my role here is as an apprentice teacher and not as a laborer."" ""People don't like to think of their work as graduate students as work that needs to be organized,"" said Michael Palm, a graduate student at NYU who had come to support the strike. Carpio agreed. ""It's a misconception that unions are only necessary for blue collar or low income workers. Unions are good for anyone who has a boss in this country, and wants to have a say. A union is a simple thing,"" he said. ""It's not such a radical idea."" Seasonwein also pointed to the support that Columbia currently gives graduate students. ""I get all my tuition paid for, access to subsidized housing,health coverage, subsidized dental care ... and I get extra grants for summertime research,"" she said. ""I don't see what the problems are. Getting paid to study is a privilege."" Karina Attar, a graduate student in the Italian department, agreed that the benefits of a graduate school education are tremendous, but decided to go on strike regardless. ""I am grateful as a graduate student,"" she said,""but quality of life and intellectual growth are two different things. Nobody here is trying to make $150,000 a year. We're just trying to have a reasonable quality of life. We're the educators of the next generation."" According to Henry Pinkham, dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Sciences, graduate education at Columbia University has been transformed over the past thirty years through the slow development of new methods of funding, and especially since the gradual introduction of a full-fund-ing plan starting in 1996. Currently, in any semester that a graduate student is a teaching fellow, a graduate student receives a stipend—sl7,ooo in 2003-2004 in addition to a full tuition fellowship, for a total value that Pinkham estimated at $50,000 per year. Many students also receive stipends during semesters in which they are not teaching or performing research. Pinkham said that the drive for the increase in funding came primarily from competition with peer institutions. ""If we had not done this, we would no longer have been able to attract top students,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""In terms of funding we are fully competitive with all but perhaps two or three Ph.D. programs in the United States."" Some graduate students say that it's not enough to trust the University. ""You need a voice that does not get its authority from the University itself,"" said Theresa Ventura, a third-year graduate student in the history department. ""There is nothing guaranteeing that the next years of incoming graduate students will have the same package."" Carpio said that many students were overly caught up in predicting the details of possible scenarios that could confront a union and were consequently left frightened by unionization. ""It's paralysis by analysis,"" he said. 'The details come in at the level of the bargaining table."" But for some graduate students, those details are essential in deciding whether or not to supportthe union. Morgan Mihok, a first-year graduate student in the Chemistry department, said that she was reluctant to take a stand because she felt that there were a lot of questions that hadn't been addressed. ""I need more information before I can feel like I am being represented,"" Mihok said. She explained that because so much of the debate took place two years ago, many current students are not informed about the potential benefits or disadvantages of a union. ""The groundwork here may have been done, but it has not been presented to me,"" she said. Mihok said that most of her information had come from talking with GSEU members individually or during rallies and protests. Other graduate students have complained about GSEU's grassroots method of organizing. This approach consisted primarily of contacting graduate students individually throughout the academic year. GSEU members offered graduate students the opportunity to sign union authorization cards that stated that they authorized UAW to ""represent them in collective bargaining"" and to use their names in support of the union. Carpio said that he felt GSEU organizers had done a good job of reaching out to their supporters, and educating other graduate students over the past year. ""When someone says they don't want to be contacted, we don't contact them. Likewise, if they say come back later, we do,"" he said. In addition to concerns about"
378,"Demanding Right to Form Union, Graduate Students Begin Strike Dispute Over Impounded Ballots and Desire for Graduate Student Union Leads Graduate Student Employees Unite Group o Strike; University Maintains Anti-Union Stance While Attempting to Minimize Negative Impact on Undergraduates",12 May 2004,"Dispute Over Impounded Ballots and Desire for Graduate Student Union Leads Graduate Student Employees Unite Group o Strike; University Maintains Anti-Union Stance While Attempting to Minimize Negative Impact on UndergraduatesBy Rebecca Aronauer Spectator Staff WriterFor the past four weeks, Graduate Student Employees United members have marched outside the Broadway gates demanding one thing: the right to vote for a union. After countless canceled classes and altered finals, the administration and GSEU remain at impasse. The strike's success is difficult to measure. When GSEU announced the strike, administrators had already decided that it would continue to wait for the National Labor Relations Board's ruling and not allow a graduate student vote on unionization. Four weeks of chants and marches in and around Low Library have not changed the administration's policy, and the administration and GSEU have never met formally to discuss an agreement. Despite the absent TAs, most professors have followed University Provost Alan Brinkley's mandate that all students receive grades. As the strike progressed, many precepts returned to the classroom from the picket line. In University Writing, Director Joseph Bizup originally thought a great majority of the precepts were striking, but said that number has fluctuated to less than half. For some core classes like Art Hum and Music Hum, directors were able to cover the classes of striking precepts. But even without a tangible victory, like a card count or the University withdrawing its appeal from NLRB, GSEU still considers the strike a success. ""We thought the strike was great,"" said David Carpio, a GSEU spokesman and former Columbia biology graduate student. The strike created a heightened awareness about GSEU's cause. Over 50 professors signed a letter to University President Lee Bollinger urging him to allow the graduate students to vote on unionization. Columbia clerical workers and undergraduates marched with graduate students. On the eighth day of the strike, hundreds of protesters and GSEU supports came out to hear John Sweeny, the president of the AFL-CIO, speak in favor of a graduate student vote on unionization. The strike has been featured in The New York Times three times, and was the subject of a New Yorker 'Talk of the Town""piece. 'The union campaign is significantly stronger due to the strike,"" Carpio said. ""The strike has strengthened and the support for a TA/RA union."" As the semester ends, the strike may not. If the NLRB does not rule this summer on Columbia's appeal to a ruling that graduate students and undergraduate students working as teaching assistants were employees of the University, GSEU may continue its strike in the fall. ""We're determined to get union recognition. We'll do anything we can to get it,"" Carpio said. If the strike does continue into the fall, the administration will not rescind its appeal and allow the ballots from 2002 vote on unionization to be counted. The University will also not agree to a new graduate student card count on unionization. ""There's been no change in the University's policy,"" Brinkley said. The NLRB has indicated that it will decide on Columbia's case, as well as similar appeals from the University of Pennsylvania, Tufts, and Brown soon. Last April, David Parker, the board's deputy executive secretary, told The New York Times that the University's case was under consideration and would be decided in a matter of months. The lack of a NLRB ruling has also impeded officially deciding if a majority of graduate students want a union. The board impounded graduate and applicable undergraduate students' votes in 2002, and the ballots are still uncounted. The NLRB delay created another split between the administration and GSEU: those who will wait for the board's ruling, and those won't. 'We've been more patient [than GSEU],"" said Henry Pinkham, the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science. ""We fully expected to have a decision a long time ago."" When the appeal process began, GSEU staged a two-day walkout in May to pressure the University to drop its case. The walkout cancelled three-fifths of Logic & Rhetoric (the predecessor to University Writing) classes on its firstday, but Columbia continued with its ase. In April 2003, GSEU held ""Free the Box Ballot Box"" rally on Low Steps. Members of GSEU see the patience as indicative of their anti-union stance ""They're completel; stonewalling us right now,"" Maurice Leutenegger, a physics graduate studmt, sa id last February. Eager to prove that a majority of gaduate students wanted a union during the lengthy appeal, GSEU collected uiion authorization cards from teaching and research assistants. In March, few York State Senate Minority leader David A. Paterson counted the cards aid that GSEU had a majority. Paterson did not release the exact lumber of 'authorization cards he counted nor is an exact count of eligible TVs or RAs available. And though hundreds have protested during the pas four weeks, it is still possible that a majority of graduate students do not vant to unionize. i n the buildup to the 2002 vote on unionization, a group )f anti-unionization graduate students formed called Graduate Student Agaiist Unionization. GSAU disbanded after the election and the appeal, but anti-uiion seqtiiment amongst graduate students still exists. ""I am concerned that if a union cones on campus, it will further alienate graduate students from the universiy administration, the faculty, and the undergraduates,"" art history graduatestudent Jody Sieasonwein wrote in an email. Pro-union graduate students at Conell were confident tihat they win would the first union ballot in the Ivy Leagie in October 2002, but 70 percent of Cornell graduate students voted agaiist unionization. But GSEU is confident that two-ye.r old ballots now i a t NLRB office show that a majority wants a union. ""We wouldn't be fighting so hard \ v^ e didn't think we won the election,"" Leutenegger said. Whether or not GSEU has a mjority, its strike has had impact on Columbia. Core Directors estimate hat the strike affected four Literature Humanities sections, five Art Humaiities sections, between eight and 12Contemporary Civilization sections, two Music Humanities sections, and a little under half of the University Writing sections. The day after GSEU announced the strike, Brinkley posted a press release on the Columbia Web site saying he would prioritize minimizing the strike's disruption to the University and ensuring all students received grades. ""Ensuring that every student receives credit for academic work this semester is a core and irrevocable commitment of the University,"" Brinkley wrote. The clash between the indefinite strike and the administration's determination to have students receive credit for their classes this semester have left some undergraduates feeling torn between their education and support for the strike. ""I can't say that we've succeeded in avoiding all disruption,"" Brinkley said. ""[The students] are caught, and I regret that."" Contemporary Civilizations, the class most affected by the strike after University Writing, has especially frustrated sophomores. Eileen Gillooly, the director of the Core Curriculum, organized two review sessions during class hours two weeks ago, and students of striking precepts took a universal final last Friday. One CC precept who held class off campus in the last weeks of the semester said, ""The administration has immunized itself by demanding that all students receive grades."" Some CC students petitioned the final and requested incompletes for the semester. An incomplete for any student because of the strike would have breached Brinkley's demand for all students to receive credit for the semester, so Gilooly did not give those students incompletes but did allow them to take the exam pass/fail. Petition organizers like Brian Ruby, SEAS 'O6, distributed stickers during last Friday's final for students to put on their blue books, saying that the exam ""compromises the academic integrity of my Contemporary Civilization experience."" ""Whatever complaints we had about the CC final would have been tenfold,one hundred-fold, if we postponed the exam until the fall."" Brinkley said. ""Neither option wad ideal. But I think the option was we choose was the right choice."" The strike has forced professors of large lectures to grade many papers and finals themselves. Faced with the daunting task of grading hundreds of exams, some professors have made finals multiple-choice or altogether optional. DeWitt Clinton Professor of History Eric Foner taught U.S. Era of Civil War and Reconstruction this semester, a lecture with more than 150 students. Without the majority of his TAs, Foner must grade over 100 final papers and exams. Though he supports the graduate students' right to vote on a union, he said he felt conflicted between supporting the graduate students and teaching his undergraduate students during the closing weeks of the semester. 'The union is asking us to choose between our graduate and undergraduate students,"" Foner said. In September, Columbia students may return to the now familiar sight of protesters on Broadway, a graduate student union, or continued tension between the administration and graduate students. But no matter what happens this summer, the results on the education world will be enormous. The GSEU action this semester marked the first indefinite strike in the Ivy League. The strike's success in rallying community, faculty, and student support and its failure to change the administration's policy will be an example to both graduate students and administrators at schools where students are struggling to form unions, like Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Tufts. Robert Barchi, the provost at Penn, condemned the GSEU strike. The NLRB impounded Penn graduate student votes on unionization in 2003 after a university-initiated appeal. ""Every victory brings about energy and the sense of possibility to every campus,"" said Mary Reynolds, a Yale graduate student in American studies and a spokeswoman for Yale's Graduate Student Employees Organization."
379,"Univ. Mourns Deaths of Three Students, Six Faculty",12 May 2004,"By Molly Melican Spectator Staff WriterFrom one of the University's most famed professors to a controversial provost and three students, this year saw the death of several Columbians past and present.Andrew Kosoresow, CC 'B5, Assistant Professor of Computer Science June 1, 2003 Assistant professor of computer science Andrew Kosoresow, 39, died of heart failure at his home in New York City on June 1, 2003. Kosoresow, CC 'B5, joined Columbia's faculty in 1997 after teaching at the Univeristy of New Mexico and Stanford University. A well-liked instructor, Kosoresow taught courses on subjects ranging from artificial intelligence to data structures and algorithms. He also served as the assistant director of undergraduate studies for the computer science department. Yet he is remembered more for his personal relationships with students in the department. ""He would always give time to a student,"" said professor Alfred Aho, the computer science department chair. ""Many faculty are just too busy to drop everything to pay attention to a student, but he would always give time."" Aho added, ""He would interact with students on a variety of levels, not just advising them on what courses to take but advising them on careers and on life in general."" In 1998, Kosoresow helped revive the Columbia chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, a group that organizes events and provides pre-profes-sional support for students interested in computer science. In 2001, he received the Kim Award for Faculty Involvement from the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. His major research areas were combinatorial algorithms, artificial intelligence, distributed and parallel computing, and graph theory. Students remember the quirkiness of Kosoresow, the way he sometimes threw candy or brownies at students when they answered questions correctly—for ""brownie points""—or that he occasionally included questions on cartoons or movies in exams. James P. Shenton, CC '49, Professor of History June 25, 2003 Longtime history professor James P. Shenton died June 25, 2003 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson, N.J. He was 78. Shenton, CC '49, began teaching history at Columbia in 1951 and remained a member of the faculty for more than 50 years. He was legendary for his passion for teaching and for his lecturing without notes, and remained popularwith his students throughout his time at the University. In addition to graduating from the College, Shenton received his M.A. from Columbia in 1950 and his doctorate in 1954. An American historian who focused on immigration and ethnicity in the 19th and 20th centuries, Shenton published extensively, including his books An Historian's History of the United States (1967), The Melting Pot (1973), and These United States (1978). 'There were years and years in which he was one of the most celebrated members of the faculty of Columbia,"" said University Provost Alan Brinkley. Over the course of his time at Columbia, Shenton proved his devotion to his students time and again, but perhaps the most visible act of his dedication came during the 1968 student protests. Shenton and several other faculty members sustained injuries at the time whenattempting to act as a human barrier between protesting students and the charging police officers. DeWitt Clinton Professor of History Eric Foner, CC '63, was one of Shenton's proteges, and has followed in his mentor's footsteps with his enormous popularity among Columbia students. Foner once said that he had planned to be a physics major until he took one of Shenton's classes. Shenton continued teaching as long as his health would allow him, stopping only a few years ago. In 1996, Shenton told Columbia College Today, ""I have enjoyed what I have been doing here and I think 99 percent of my enjoyment arose out of the people here. We are a pretty interesting lot. I hope I was as interesting as they were."" ""I'm a hedonist,"" he added. ""I'm doing what I enjoy doing."" In his time at Columbia, Shenton received virtually every one of the University's teaching and alumni awards, including the Mark Van Doren Award (1971), the Great Teacher Award (1976), the John Jay Award (1995), and the Hamilton Medal (1999). In 1996, he was one of the first recipients of Columbia's Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching. Arthur Cleveland Helton, CC '7l, Adjunct Professor of Law August 19, 2003 Arthur Cleveland Helton, a Columbia College graduate and Columbia Law School adjunct professor who spent much of his life advocating for refugee rights, was among 23 people killed on August 19, 2003 in the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad. Helton, 54, was in the area to meet with the U.N.'s chief envoy to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, to assess humanitarian concerns in post-war Iraq. De Mello was also killed in the bombing.Helton had served as an adjunct lecturer at the law school since 2001, specializing in classes primarily on immigration law and policy. He also served as the director of peace and conflict studies for the Council on Foreign Relations and as a senior fellow for refugee studies and preventive action.After obtaining a law degree from New York University in 1982, Helton took a position at the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights and soon founded the committee's Refugee Rights Program. The program aims to help refugees fleeing persecution find asylum in the United States. Today, the Refugee Rights Program assists more than 1,000 individuals and families each year. ""People now talk about how refugee rights are human rights,"" said Michael Posner, the executive director of the LCHR. ""Arthur was in the forefront of promoting that idea. He was a major force in building concern for refugees first in the U.S. and then he took that concern international."" Helton was the well-known author of several books, including The Price of Indifference: Refugees and Humanitarian Action in the New Century. Published in 2002, the book has received recognition from policy makers around the world, including U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who said publicly that the book would ""help us to manage humanitarian challenges better in the future."" David Truman, Former University Provost August 28, 2003 David Truman, a former Columbia professor, dean, and provost, died Aug. 28, 2003 at age 90. Truman is widely remembered by the Columbia community for his role in the 1968 student protests that ended with two police confrontations. He became a tenured professor at the University in 1951 and dean of Columbia College in 1962 before becoming provost in 1967. Considered a top scholar of American politics, Truman is the published author of a number of books on the subject. One of very few progressive high-level administrators at the time of the 1968 riots, Truman had been popular with students for hissupport for civil rights and other social causes. Yet in 1968, Truman was seen as the figurehead for the unpopular Columbia administration. Students angered at the University for its ties to the United States Defense Department in the midst of the Vietnam War, as well as for its plans to build a gym in Morningside Park began to protest. The protest climaxed when students took over Hamilton Hall and five other campus buildings. Truman is widely remembered as attempting to end the standoff, yet also made the decision alongside then University President Grayson Kirk, to call in the New York Police Department. One thousand NYPD officers stormed the building. Another takeover and subsequent raid by police officials three weeks later led both Truman and Kirk to resign by the end of the year. Truman took a position as president of Mount Holyoke College, where he served until 1978. He published his last book in 1993 before retiring to Florida with his wife, Elinor Griffenhagen, who still resides there. Jessica Pastron, CC 'O7 November 12, 2003 First-year Jessica Pastron, CC 'O7, was found dead by her resident adviser in her Furnald Hall room on Nov. 12, 2003. Preliminary reports at the time indicated that she died from natural causes, and a New York Police Department investigator said then that there was no foul play involved and that Pastron's death was not a suspected suicide. Subsequent autopsy reports have proved inconclusive. Friends remember not only her flashy appearance and enthusiasm for life, but her confidence. To them, she was a leader.""You couldn't know her —couldn't even meet her —without being affected by her,"" one friend said. ""She touched every single person she knew. She was impossible to ignore."" Jessi's individuality led friends to call her ""Princess"" after she came to school wearing a tiara. She always wore something sparkly, even if just a rhinestone ring on one of her fingers. Jessi was an accomplished pianist as well, who frequently performed in music festivals at home in California, and studied in France over the summer. ""It wasn't just that she was good, it was that she exuded spirit even when she played,"" the friend said. ""Even if she was playing something really simple, she made it sound incredible."" Fran Pritchett, Jessi's Literature Humanities professor, said that Jessi had impressed her with her enthusiasm to learn andher unique insights into the material. Pritchett called Jessi a cheerful presence in the class who was not afraid to challenge others' opinions. ""She was alertly interested in everything that was going on,"" Pritchett said. ""I think she was thriving."" ""She was beautiful. She was hilarious. She was talented. She always will be,"" wrote close friend Ariel Hirsch, a student at San Francisco State University. ""She was my friend ... and that will never change."" Fraser Lunan, CC 'O6 December 13, 2003 Fraser Lunan, CC 'O6, died on Dec. 13, 2003 at home in Baie D'Urfe, Quebec, where he had been on leave for most of the fall semester. The cause of death, according to a spokesman in the Quebec coroner's office, was suicide. Friends and family remember Lunan, 20, best for the way he always ""kept it real."" ""He never seemed to care what people thought,"" said Russ Tanenbaum, CC 'O6, a first-year floormate of Lunan's on the 15th floor of John Jay Hall. ""He was a super smart kid, really thoughtful,"" said Dave Myers, CC 'O6, who remembers Lunan as his best friend at Columbia. Myers recalled how much he enjoyed having philosophical discussions with Lunan, and said he was always impressed with his friend's depth of knowledge. Chelsea Lunan said she admired her older brother's intelligence and passion for learning. ""He liked to think a lot and he loved to read. His entire room was covered in books,"" she said. ""I'd always go to him for advice, and when it came to education, he told me how he believed that education was so important because it made you a fuller person."" In a eulogy for his brother, Jordan Lunan wrote, ""Listing adjectives that describe Fraser only damn him with faint praise—intelligent, eloquent, and analytical are suitable but offer just a glimpse of his true personality."" What perhaps defined Lunan best was his easygoing independence —what Jordan described in his eulogy as ""his sometimes blatant disregard for authority and his desire to do things the only way he saw fit."" Jodie Lane, Teachers College Ph.D. student January 16, 2004 Teachers College doctoral student Jodie Lane, 30, died on Jan. 16, 2004 in an electrical accident on an East Village street. One year away from earning her Ph.D. in clinical psychology, Lane was preparing to present her doctoral thesis about obsessivecompulsive disorder in children. Lane was electrocuted on East 11th Street while out walking her two dogs. An investigation by Consolidated Edison revealed that a frayed wire had sent a circuit through a metal plate on the sidewalk, and sent a shock through Lane when she touched the metal curb. Local news reports stated that Lane was calling for help after her two dogs were shocked, and apparently touched the curb while leaning down to help them. Witnesses reported that Lane said ""I know"
380,NLRB Rules Brown Students Can't Unionize,7 September 2004,"By Rebecca Aronauer Spectator Staff WriterAfter three years, the National Labor Relations Board ruled this summer that Brown graduate students are not employees of their university and do not have the right to unionize. The decision, released on July 13, overturns the 2000 precedent set in a New York University case that granted graduate student teaching and research assistants at private universities worker status, giving them the right to form unions and use collective bargaining for contracts. But the landmark decision will not affect Columbia's case directly, administrators said. The NLRB's New York regional board will rule on the status of Columbia University graduate students, many of whom went on strike in support of unionization last spring. ""We're still in limbo,"" said Susan Brown, Columbia's assistant vice president for public affairs. Following the NLRB's precedent, the Philadelphia Labor Relations Board ruled on Aug. 26 that University of Pennsylvania graduate students are not employees of the university and do not have the right to unionize. Representatives from the New YorkRegional Board said they have not yet determined which precedent to follow. 'We haven't decided what to do yet,"" said Elbert Tellem, assistant regional director of the New York Board. The 3-2 verdict in the Brown case followed partisan lines: President George W. Bush's three Republican appointees overturned the NYU ruling, while those selected during former president Bill Clinton's tenure upheld the precedent. In their majority opinion, Chairman Robert Battista, Peter Schaumber, and Ronald Meisburg wrote, ""It is clear to us that graduate student assistants ... are primarily students and have a primarily education[al], not economic, relationship with their university."" Despite the national decision in the Brown case and regardless of the regional board decision, representatives from Columbia's Graduate Student Employees Unite group said they would continue to fight for a union. ""[A ruling won't] change our position and it [won't] change our g0a1... to organize and continue to fight to form our union,"" GSEU member and sixth-year philosophy graduate student David Wolach said. ""There's nothing making it illegal for us to unionize."" If the New York Regional Board rules that Columbia graduate students are not employees, the University could still sponsor a voteon unionization. If a union resulted, graduate students would not have the support of the NLRB but would have all other union privileges, such as collective bargaining. GSEU members said they hope that the Columbia administration will recognize a union no matter what the decision from the New York board is. The group has not ruled out resuming last spring's strike to pressure the University to support a graduate student vote on unionization, members said. ""There's nothing stopping [University President] Lee Bollinger and the Columbia administration from recognizing our union with or without the labor board. We're going to continue to organize for a union and try to pressure the University until they recognize us,"" Wolach said. The administration's position has not changed since the strike for union recognition during the summer. ""I believe that both the University and graduate students will be better off over time if there is not the intermediary of the union,"" Bollinger said last week. In the future, Bollinger hopes to create more of a university consensus about this issue. ""We need to find a way for the faculty, in arts and science in particular, to participatein the University's policy towards this issue,"" he said. Last spring's strike caused the cancellation of numerous discussion sections, Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and University Writing classes and altered countless finals. During the strike, Columbia administrators continued to wait for the NLRB's ruling on its March 2002 appeal to the board's February 2002 ruling that gave employee status to Columbia graduate students and a small group of undergraduates working as teaching and research assistants. The administration tried to minimize disorder by ensuring that all seniors obtained their grades before gradua-tion and underclassmen received credit for their classes. The conflicting strategies of striking graduate students, who were trying to create disorder to raise awareness of their cause, and the administration's efforts to the contrary affected professors and students the most. Professors of large lectures had to grade papers and finals without the help of their striking assistants. That crunch changed exams and some students were left feeling lost without the help of their protesting TAs during reading week. Sophomores were especially frustrated with the Core office's policy toward CC. Professors David Armitage and Jim Zetzel, the current and former heads of CC, taught large lectures to make up sections lost to the strike, and the Core office wrote a universal finalfor students with absent precepts. Administrators refused requests for incompletes from sophomores who were upset with the common final. Objecting students placed stickers on their exam books saying ""[this final] compromises the academic integrity of my Contemporary Civilization experience."" The strike went on hiatus before commencement at the request of City Council speaker Gifford Miller and State Senate Minority Leader David Paterson. The politicians also had written to University President Bollinger about an amiable end to the strike. GSEU representatives spoke with Provost Alan Brinkley in June for the first time since the strike began but say they have not met with the administration since.Graduate students staged picket lines across campus in April and May to demand a union and employee benefits.Columbia graduate students that went on strike for a union last spring were disappointed by this summer's NLRB ruling."
381,CU Ranks Eighth on Minority College List Black Enterprise Ranking Puts Columbia as Top Ivy Despite Spring Controversy Over Racism,29 September 2004,"Black Enterprise Ranking Puts Columbia as Top Ivy Despite Spring Controversy Over RacismBy Liz Fink Spectator Staff WriterA survey released this week by Black Enterprise magazine ranks Columbia as the eighth best college in the country for African Americans, and the top Ivy League university on the list. Columbia fell just between Stanford and Harvard Universities, and behind such historically all-black institutions as Morehouse College and Hampton University. The top 10 includes six historically all-black colleges and seven Southern colleges. The rankings were based on surveys from 1,855 Af-rican-American higher educational officials and categorized according to the same procedures used by U.S. News and World Report. Columbia's high rank elicited equal parts shock and celebration among black students on campus, many of whom said the rating attests to Columbia's tradition of high levels of student diversity and the multiculturalism inherent in being in New York City. The rankings ""definitely say something positive,"" said Anthony Walker, CC 'O7 and vice president of the Black Students Organization. ""I think Columbia really has a commitment to diversity."" Yet some suggest there is a conflic between Columbia's diverse image and the institutional problems suggested by last year's protests over a series of racially controversial incidents. Maritza Jean-Louis, CC 'O5, said that she was surprised by the ratings. ""If this is the best, that says a lot about the other colleges,"" she said. Walker estimated that people of color compose 30 percent of the Columbia undergraduate student body. But according to the Princeton Review Web site, eight percent of Columbia College undergraduates are African American and eight percent are Hispanic, while 54 percent are Caucasian. This level of minority enrollment—similar to that of other Ivy colleges—is credited to Columbia's aggressive minority recruitment programs and results in an environment that many feel fosters a strong community for minority students. Some said that diversity in the student body, might not be enough to provide a truly diverse environment, as demonstrated by last year's accusations of racism and continuing discussions over the relevance of a Eurocen-trie Core Curriculum. Jean-Louis said that a diverse student body is not enough when it is not reflected in the faculty and administration. In her seven semesters at Columbia, she said she has had just one African-American professor, a common experience that is being addressed by the newly appointed vice provost of diversity initiatives. ""Columbia prides itself on its diversity, but many times I question it when I go into a classroom and I know that over 95 percent of the time the professor is going to be white,"" Jason Frazer, CC 'O5, said. Frazer pointed out that Columbia's statistics on persons of color employed are deceptive because ""Columbia will say it [theoretically] employs 15 percent people of color, but I question where these people are working."" ""I have a huge problem when I go into the dining room or when I see the cleaning staff—they're all practically people of color,"" Frazer said. ""However, when I go into Low Library, the staff seems to be all white. As a person of color, 1 want to know, if I'm good enough to serve you your food and clean your dishes, am I not good enough to lead the University on the faculty and administrative level?"" Frazer and Jean-Louis agreed that a stronger minority presence in administration is crucial for minority student voices to be heard throughout campus decision making. Walker, however, cited administration responsiveness as a Columbia strength. Walker worked closely with the administration during the protests last year and was said he was impressed that the Office of Multicultural Affairswas created within a year. It ""is definitely testament to the fact they have a concern,"" he said. Walker said the high visibility of the office and its readiness to integrate itself within the Columbia community is extremely promising and represents steps in the right direction. Walker also highlighted the Office of Multicultural Affairs as part of what is needed to address to the causes of last year's racism controversy. Dean Corlisse Thomas-Deberry was appointed to run the Office of Multicultural Affairs, which was created in part as a response to the con-troversy. In an e-mail, Thomas-Deberry said the office ""seeks to strengthen and enhance the richly diverse fabric of the Columbia community."" The Office of Multicultural Affairs' purpose speaks to what Walker described as the underlying causes for the protests last year. Walker faulted ""a larger systemic problem within the University ... it wasn't necessarily the fact that those things happened, but wow, people actually hold those views ... I definitely don't say it was definitely just The Fed."" The students also expressed con-cern that the Core Curriculum refuses to move out of the Western world. ""We get an extremely biased view of things when you're only reading"" from a Western viewpoint, Walker said. ""Where's the diversity in the Core? The silly little major cultures requirement?"" Frazer asked. ""I don't think we want three-quarters of the Core to be Harlem Renaissance writers—just get them in there."" While not one of the students was in favor of expanding the number of classes in the Core, they agreed that Literature Humanities and Contempo-"
382,"Graduates Honor 'Great Teachers' CC's Hood, SEAS's Shahabuddin, and Core's Smit Win Teaching Awards",30 September 2004,"CC's Hood, SEAS's Shahabuddin, and Core's Smit Win Teaching AwardsBy Josie Swindler Spectator Staff WriterThe Society of Columbia Graduates awarded its two latest Great Teacher Awards last night to psychology professor Donald Hood and industrial engineering and operations research professor Perwez Shahabuddin. History professor Jacob W. Smit received special recognition for his dedication to the Core Curriculum. Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Zvi Galil and Columbia College Dean Austin Quigley spoke briefly before Society President Paul A. de Bary, CC '6B, announced the winners. Quigley told the crowd of approximately 150, mostly alumni from the 1940s through the 19605, that ""greatteaching is in fact quite a mystical experience"" for both students and teachers. ""Great teaching is an enormous intellectual challenge,"" he said. Hood, the James F. Bender professor of psychology, has taught at Columbia for more than three decades. In 1993 the Columbia College Student Council gave him the Mark van Doren Award for Outstanding Teaching. From 1982 to 1987, he was the vice president for Arts and Sciences. Telling the crowd that students have changed only superficially in his 35 years at Columbia, Hood said, ""There's more metal hanging from different parts of the body ... more holes drilled ... more baseball caps, especially facing the wrong way."" But he emphasized that students are as intellectually aggressive as ever, and that Columbia outshines its peers inthat respect. Shahabuddin has only been at Columbia since 1994, and was not made a full professor until January 2004. He came to Columbia from his native India by way of Stanford. Before teaching at Columbia he conducted research for IBM. Shahabuddin said he longed to enter academia because ""I was missing interacting with young minds ... their enthusiasm ... their idealism."" He won one of the first Distinguished Faculty Teaching Awards from the Columbia Engineering School Alumni Association. Shahabuddin, who has a slight speech impediment, said, ""Despite my stuttering I do manage to connect with my students. ... There is something mystical in that connection."" He praised his students forgiving him a chance to prove himself based on content rather than judging him by his first lecture. Since the Core's inception nearly 60 years ago, Smit has been one the few people to ever teach all four of its major classes: Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities, which he says he did because hecouldn't decide what to be when he grew up. ""My life would become totally empty without having [students] around me constantly,"" Smit said. Following the awards and the brief acceptance speeches, Middle East and Asian languages and cultures professor George Saliba presented a PowerPoint lecture entitled ""Arabic Science and the Making of the Renaissance Europe.""The ceremony, held in Low Rotunda, was the 56th Great Teacher Awards Dinner sponsored by the Society, and the Society's 95th annual meeting. Previous award winners include Mark Van Doren in 1949, Lionel Trilling in 1955, William Theodore de Bary in 1970, James B. Shenton in 1976, Eric Foner in 1991, Kenneth Jackson in 1999, and Alan Brinkley in 2003.Engineering professor Perwez Shahabuddin and psychology professor Donald Hood wait to receive their Great Teacher Awards.Donald Hood was one of two professors honored last night with a Great Teacher Award."
383,"Memorial Service Commemorates Life of Academic Affairs Dean Lea Baechler, Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs, Died Suddenly Last Week at 52 After Aneurysm; Colleagues Remember her As Talented Educator",6 October 2004,"Lea Baechler, Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs, Died Suddenly Last Week at 52 After Aneurysm; Colleagues Remember her As Talented EducatorBy Alex Green IV Columbia Daily SpectatorAt a memorial service held in St. Paul's Chapel yesterday, co-workers, friends, and family members celebrated the life and mourned the death of Lea Baechler, assistant dean of Academic Affairs. Baechler died Friday afternoon of a brain aneurism at the age of 52. Dean of Columbia College Austin Quigley spoke first at the memorial service, fondly re-membering Baechler as an honorable person and a distinguished professional. ""She worked closely with faculty, the Committee of the Core, the Office of Scholars and Fellows, but most importantly, she worked with students,"" Quigley said. According to Quigley, when students had strong justifiable claims against University rules and regulations, they were sent to Baechler. What was most astounding about Baechler was that she was such a multi-fac-eted individual whose intellect and spirit allowed her to interact with all people—from her administrator colleagues to students, her friends emphasized. Quigley added, ""Lea as an administrator saw herself primarily as an educator. Though she came to it late in life, it was as though she had been preparing for it all of her life."" Baechler did in fact come late to academia; she was still adding the finishing touches to her dissertation in the English department.Baechler taught at Columbia, Barnard College, Princeton University, and the University of Idaho. During her tenure at Columbia, she taught English, Creative Writing, Literature Humanities, and Great Books; while at Barnard, Baechler worked in the Department of English. She is remembered by Dr. Margaret Vandenburg, a Barnard co-worker, as ""a lover of young people ... someone who always tried to understand life in larger-than-life context.""Vandenburg continued, ""For gifted teachers like Lea, all classes are particularly wonderful."" According to the memorial service's speakers, Baechler tried to transcend the norm and elevate the intensity of the human experience through her exploration of mourning and loss in poetry. She was interested in the elegiac genre and her fascination with perfecting thearticulation of poetry was apparent through her work. Her Masters thesis was entitled ""The Middle English Passion Lyric: Meditation and Affective Devotion,"" her Masters of Fine Arts thesis was entitled ""This River is in the Sky,"" and her dissertation was entitled 'Twentieth Century American Elegies: Loss, Mourning and Poetic Process."" Even though Baechler was an intellectual, she found time to spend moments in solitude on the beach. She loved the rugged mountains of Idaho, where she learned to wear her trademark cowboy boots so well that Vandenburg said she loved ""her cowboy boots as fervently as a native."" Baechler leaves behind two sisters, Jan and Kim, her father, and three nieces, Erin, Heather, and Kelly. In addition, she leaves behind an extended family of co-workers, friends, and other admirers who will forever miss her and cherish her memory. Carolyn DeMerice, a friend of Baechler's and an employee of Caffe Taci said that Baechler was as enthralled by her students as they were enthralled by her. ""She touched so many of us,"" she said.A memorial service was held for Lea Baechler, assistant dean of Student Services, who died on Friday."
384,"The Major Problems Of Major Cultures Hans, Solo Gautam Hans",14 October 2004,"Hans, Solo Gautam HansOkay people. Today I'm going to tell you a short tale about this giant dysfunctional family called the Core Curriculum. Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities are the parents, Art and Music Hum. are the teenage twins, University Writing and Frontiers of Science are the bratly five-year-olds, and the science and foreign language requirements are the crazy relatives who come by every so often to make your life miserable. But life is more or less happy and integrated in the Core family, though they seem to talk about Western European culture a lot. Then one day they find out that they have some long-lost cousins who are going to stay with them from now on. These two cousins, known as Major Cultures, are young, and they think that they can make a difference in the world by teaching people about each other's lives and backgrounds. But after a few months the pair, who have been ignored by the Core family, become disillusioned, and eventually everyone else stops paying attention to what they're trying to say. The Major Cultures requirement was instituted in the 1980s to increase global awareness in the Core and answer long-standing complaints that the Core was biased in favor of Dead White Males. According to the Columbia College Bulletin, ""the Major Cultures requirement promotes learning and thought about the variety of civilizations and the diversity of traditions that have formed the world and continue to interact in it today."" In theory, the Major Cultures requirement sounds like a great idea: engage students in the world beyond the U.S. and Western Europe by making them take classes that focus on civilizations worldwide. Whether or not that actually works is a matter of opinion. Major Cultures is hampered by an extremely complex and frustrating hierarchical system (which is hardly surprising, given Columbia's love of confusing its students about academic regulations) that places classes in three different categories: Lists A, B, and C. Every student has to start with a class from List A, and the second class can either be any List A class or a List B or C class from the same civilization as the first List A class. And the List B/C class has to be taken after the List A class. Confused yet? So, why does Columbia make students jump through hoops to open their minds? There's no guarantee that a student will retain any relevant cultural knowledge after the class is complete. Unlike Lit. Hum. and Contemporary Civilization, which have their own departments and aren't geared toward specific majors, many Major Cultures courses are advanced courses in departments where the intention is not to increase cultural awareness for the novice. Having taken two literature classes for my Major Cultures requirement— Colloquium on East Asian Texts and Latin American Hum—l feel that Columbia could both vastly simplify the requirement and ensure that students are actually learning something. Instead of having multilayered List classes, the easiest solution would be to emulate the Lit. Hum.-Contem-porary Civilization-Art/Music Hum. model. By making each student take a literature or history class on one civilization and an art history or music class on another, a new Major Cultures requirement would be much easier to understand and also tie into existing Core classes. Since every student takes Lit. Hum. and Contemporary Civilization, a literature or history class would be a natural extension of the themes and ideas that get stuffed down our throats our first two years here. An art or music class would similarly tie into Art and/or Music Humanities. Such a scheme would preserve the element of choice in Major Cultures while also making it easier to determine what counts and what doesn't. And by incorporating the requirement more into its structure, perhaps the Core can finally accept Major Cultures into its dysfunctional family.Gautam Hans is a Columbia College junior majoring in English."

386,"Queries About the Quran Hans, Solo Gautam Hans",11 November 2004,"Hans, Solo Gautam HansIt's the giant green elephant in the room, and no one knows what do to with it. 1,720 pages long (most of it, of course, in Arabic), over an inch thick, and supremely intimidating at first glance. What's to be done about the Quran? For many sophomores, the most alien book on the Contemporary Civilization syllabus isn't the Republic or the Communist Manifesto or Leviathan. It's the Quran, Islam's sacred text, the word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by Gabriel in the early seventh century. Along with Christianity and Judaism, Islam is part of the Abrahamic triad of religions, though the Quran was recorded in its written form after the Old and New Testaments. It is, of course, impossible to talk about Islam and the Quran now without conjuring up other, extremely loaded images and ideas—the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the war in Iraq, among others. For a lot of Columbia students, that's the only introduction to Islam or the Quran that they'll receive before discussing it in Contemporary Civilization. This presents a very tricky problem. How do instructors present the Quran, teaching their students its historical value while simultaneously acknowledging the current perceptions that people have toward Islam and Muslims? The Center for the Core Curriculum has sought to address this problem in a number of ways. For Contemporary Civilization (and Literature Humanities), all preceptors can attend a weekly session in which an instructor discusses the reading for that week, highlighting certain topics that are good starting points for discussion. Not surprisingly, this proves very helpful for a text as difficult as the Quran, where even graduate students are unlikely to have a great background in its history or its tenets. Perhaps more interesting is a special sheet detailing the history of Islam that the Core Office distributes to preceptors who want a more extensive primer. Compiled by three graduate students a few years ago, the 10-page document discusses the history of Islam, from the life of Muhammad to the revelations that were recorded in the Quran to his legacy. Also discussed are issues like the place of women in an Islamic society; the relationships between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity; and democracy and Islam. There's no denying that the primer is an oversimplification. Some professors object both to the graduate students' errors, and, more importantly, to the primer's existence altogether. On a certain level, the thought that Islam can be distilled down to 10 pages is offensive—no one ever thought that Christianity or Judaism should receive similar treatment. On another level, however, the primer is necessary. In a perfect world, everyone would have approximately the same knowledge of the Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions. And perhaps a generation from now, when Columbia undergraduates themselves start teaching the Quran, they will. Thafs assuming that the Quran remains on the syllabus for good. It was only added a few years ago, and issues of tokenism still surround its position. And yet it seems that removing it would be a huge loss to the integrity of the Contemporary Civilization syllabus (as well as a PR disaster—who wants to be known as the administrator who thought that students shouldn't be reading the Quran?). Not only does the Quran serve as a logical progression from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, but for a lot of Columbia students—perhaps too many—it is the only introduction to Islam they have. With tensions running high between the United States and the Middle East, an increased understanding of other cultures is extremely important. And while some instructors may not discuss the Quran as well as they might tackle Aristotle, it seems highly unlikely that they would be so adrift as to make the Quran incoherent. Recent political developments make it imperative, now more than ever, to make Americans cognizant of how other societies work and from where their cultures derive. The Quran is probably the best place to start in regard to Islamic civilizations. Sure, two class periods in the middle of midterms don't exactly provide an ideal introduction, but as long as both students and instructors put external prejudices aside and try to dig beyond the surface to find the complex thoughts underneath, it's certainly better than nothing.Gautam Hans is a Columbia College junior majoring in English."
387,Anti-Bush Sentiment Seeps Into Classroom Students Have Mixed Reactions to Professors' Post-Election Bitterness,18 November 2004,"Students Have Mixed Reactions to Professors' Post-Election BitternessBy Rachel Trager Columbia Daily SpectatorAnti-Bush sentiment seems to be everywhere, even in Columbia classrooms. Since the outcome of the presidential elections, some professors have managed to incorporate their criticisms of Bush into their lessons in ways that they believe are relevant to the topics, with mixed reactions from students. While most students agree that discussion on the presidential election has its place in some classrooms, some called their professors' discussion of it was inappropriate. ""In my Contemporary Civilization class, my professor talked about Bush's religious agenda, considering the blending of the lines between the government and religious institutions,"" Brian Kauffman, CC 'O7, said. He said he believed that it was an appropriate discussion, because the purpose of Contemporary Civilization is to focus on Western thinking in a way that transcends time. Bush's victory was also discussed in Marisa Harary's, CC 'O6, American Politics and Social Welfare Policy class, in a way Harary said she found critical and relevant. Her professor e-mailed the class an article comparing Bush to former Republican presidents who failed to accomplish anything worthwhile regarding welfare policy. 'The article was in the context of the class,"" Harary said. ""We are learn-ing about different welfare policies—liberal versus [what exists] now."" Dmitry Shevelenko, CC 'OB, made a distinction between the suitability of anti-Bush statements in different settings. He recalled an anti-Bush comment made by professor Wally Broecker in a Frontiers of Science lecture whose topic was supposed to be the climate. ""I think in a small discussion, it's appropriate, but in large lectures, ifs not,"" Shevelenko said. ""In lectures, since professors have a monopoly on their class time and students are unable to respond, it is inappropriate for them to make charged statements."" Broecker said he did not think there was anything wrong with his statement, saying, 'Tough rocks. If you're not allowed to make a joke about the president, we're in a pretty bad state."" He said that while it is important to keep politics and science separate because people rely on scientists to tell the truth, it is some-times impossible to do so because the two are so related.In the last lecture on the climate series, Broecker plans to mention that the United States government is not taking climate problems seriously enough. ""It's so blatant—[Bush's] objection to doing anything about carbon dioxide—we'd almost be remiss if we didn't indicate to people that he's not an environmental president. But, four years won't make or break us,"" he said. Some students said they felt uncomfortable with the way professors dealt with the election in their class. Lauren Schy, CC 'OB, said that in her Literature Humanities class, students have compared overly aggres-sive characters in Thucydides' work to Bush. She said she was distressed that either the ""professor agreed or allowed the conversation to continue."" Christine Leddy, CC 'OB, agreed. ""It's okay if [professors] have a different point of view but it doesn't have to be stated in class,"" she said. ""[Many have been] saying bad things about the President and about Republicans. The elections are over. We need to come together now."" Other students said that though criticisms of the President were not related to their classes, they were not especially bothered. Briana Price, CC 'OB, said that the elections were discussed in Spanish in her Spanish class. Her professor expressed her hopes that a new president would be elected when the victor was still uncertain the day after Election Day. ""It didn't make me feel uncomfortable at all because I agreed with her,"" Price said. Brian Benvenisty, CC 'OB expressed similar thoughts. ""There's ageneral anti-Bush sentiment in classrooms which has much to do with common consensus,"" he said. ""It is the responsibility of the people [who support Bush] to put their opinions out there."" Barnard professor of political science Richard Pious teaches a class called The American Presidency, but did not touch upon the presidential election at all in the course. ""Columbia has a whole board of people who teach about elections and public opinion,"" Pious said. ""So if I teach about that, I have one-fourth less time to teach about what I know. It's called the presidency course, not the election course. The syllabus says nothing about elections and I assume students can read a syllabus,"" he said. Still, many teachers said they did not have any qualms about expressing their opinions regarding the election and its outcome. Columbia sociology professor Joshua Whitford said, ""The politics are everywhere and to take no position is to take a political position.""To take no position is to take a political position.' —Joshua Whitford"
388,Survey Says: Students Not Studying Enough,1 December 2004,"By Noor Zaidi Columbia Daily SpectatorWalking through Butler Library on any given night reveals many students hard at work. But a new study might indicate that these committed students are a minority among their peers in the rest of the country. According to an annual report by the National Survey of Student Engagement, conducted at Indiana University and released on Nov. 15, college students are studying less than the amount recommended by faculty. The NSSE report covered 163,000 first-years and seniors at 472 four-year colleges and universities nationwide. In a complementary NSSE survey of over 20,000 faculty members from 132 colleges and universities, professors said that students should study an average of six hours per class per week. Fcr a full-time student with an average course load, this constitutes about 25 hours per week. The report indicates that only 11 percent of full-time students say they spend more than the advised amount of time preparing for their classes, while 44 percent spend 10 hours a week or less studying. The report chose the students at random from colleges and universities across the country, and none of the respondents were from Columbia University. However, the survey does present the opportunity for individual Columbians to compare themselves withpeers across the country. One theory among Columbia students is that required classes such as those in Columbia's Core Curriculum could cause a lack of studying. Wendy Francois, CC 'O7, expressed her indifference toward the Core classes and said, ""Sometimes 1 wish 1 could just pass/fail all this stuff."" But, despite the additional effort it demands, not all students are ready to blame the Core. ""I actually really like the Core,"" Amitai Bick-Raziel, CC 'O7, said. ""It might seem like a pain sometimes, but the reading[s] are awesome and really give me a truly broad background to understand the world I live in today."" Administrators deny that many requirements create an attitude of apathy toward studying. ""I'm surprised to hear that people feel that,"" Sandra Johnson, associate dean of Student Affairs, said. ""I find that students spend a tremendous amount of time studying, especially for the Core. Those classes are very intensive courses. In fact, most first-years come to me saying, 'I didn't realize how much time I would need.'"" Some students at other universities also feel that students study less for required classes. Tiffany Yizar is a sophomore at Brown, which has no general requirements for graduation. ""I think not having required classes causes us to study more,"" Yizar said, ""usually because we're taking classes that we actually want to be taking or because the major that we're interested in requires them."" Some students attribute the decrease in theirstudying time to the pressures of competition that undergraduates may face in preparation for graduate studies and job markets. ""I think a lot of people here sometimes take a kind of rebellious attitude towards some required classes that don't matter towards what they want to do later in life,"" said Paolo Yap, a sophomore at Harvard. Derrick Higginbotham, a Literature Humanities instructor and GSAS student, acknowledged that some students have goals that do not direcdy relate to Columbia's required courses. ""I think students are more and more interested in a career and not in what academia wants you to do, which is slow down and think,"" Higginbotham said. ""I do think that the Core does have less value for some students. If you want to go to medical school ... Lit Hum might not be the most important class you're taking."" Despite minimal preparation time on the part of many students, 81 percent of all respondents in the national survey reported receiving grades of B or higher in all classes, and only three percent claimed to consistently receive C grades or below. Columbia University conducts its own Enrolled Student Survey every academic year to judge the quality of life for its students. In the 2003 academic year, 2,638 CC and SEAS students were polled. According the Survey, 87 percent of students agreed or strongly agreed that their intellectual engagement at Columbia, both inside and outside the classroom, was at a high level."
389,"CAMPUS CONFIDENTIAL The Writing Is on the Wall: Who Is Demosthenes, Anyway?",24 January 2005,"The Writing Is on the Wall: Who Is Demosthenes, Anyway?By Kristen Loveland Columbia Daily SpectatorIf you go to South Lawn and read the names across the front of Butler Library, you may nod in satisfaction. As a Columbia College student, you've read—or at least were supposed to read—Homer, Herodotus,and Sophocles. Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes... Demosthenes? Who is Demosthenes? Well, never mind, don't give it a thought, just move on. Cicero, Vergil, and you continue your contented nodding. But however much College students and tour guides would like to claim that they've read worksof all the names on Butler, they're wrong. The engraved names on Butler wrap around to both the east and west sides as well. Horace, Tacitus, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Milton, Voltaire, and Goethe are all permanently honored on the mam-moth structure, though they are most likely only noticed by John Jay and Carman inhabitants who have a side view of the library. But Tacitus, Horace, Voltaire, Milton, and Goethe? While both Butler Libraryand the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization reading lists claim to bear the names of great thinkers and writers, neither was meant to be a reflection of the other. The names on Butler were chosen by Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia's president from 1902-1945, who oversaw the Library's construction. Butler chose the names of 18 thinkers to engrave along the facade of the building that now bares his name, as well as the names of 24 American statesmen and authors which are inscribed on the panels under the large front windows. It seems that the choice of these names was based on nothing more than Butler's whims. At the time, Contemporary Civilization began with Medieval philosophy and primarily used secondary sources. Literature Humanities wasn't instituted until 1937, three years after the Library's construction, although it was preceded by an optional literature course called General Honors, which lasted two years and listed 75titles. Tacitus, Milton, Voltaire, and Goethe have all been read at one time or another in Literature Humanities. So why are they off the syllabus now? According to Chair of Literature Humanities Michael Seidel, books in Lit Hum ""have been read for, in many instances, 3000 years, and when they work themselves off the consciousness of the human race, then they'll drop off of the humanities list. As long as people are transfixed, perplexed, and in some cases, entertained, these books will remain."" But Seidel acknowledged that the Lit Hum reading list ""does adjust slowly to the habits of reading and to the tastes of the culture."" While both Lit Hum and CC are meant to showcase works that have significance in any age, Tacitus is the one author to have lasted very shortly in direct response to the crises of a particular time period. His writings Annals and Germany remained on the Lit Hum syllabus for only three years during World War 11, from 1942-1944. In the 1980s, Lit Hum choices similarly reflected the pressure of aspecific era, this time to pay more attention to works by women. Columbia College began accepting women in 1983, and protestors at the time took to heart the supposed significance of Butler Library's engraved names and draped banners bearing I the names Sappho, Austen, Woolf, I and other female authors beneath. The Core began to change its syllabus in response, adding Sappho, Madame de Lafayette, and Jane Austen to the Lit Hum syllabus in the mid-1980s. ""Recently, Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf have been the major women writers, in the theory that women began to be read in the Renaissance and 17th century, but in the 19th century, they really started to produce great works of literature,"" Seidel said. Voltaire has been featured on the Lit Hum syllabus for his works Candide, Zadig, and Micromegas, and on the CC syllabus for his satirical writings against the Church. Professor Pierre Force, who teaches Voltaire in his French Philosophy class, reasoned that Voltaire may no longer be on the syllabus because though ""he crystallized the debates of the time,he's not remembered as someone who invented an original system of philosophy or new doctrine."" But Contemporary Civilization Chair Philip Kitcher argued that one could make a case for the reading of Voltaire in CC. ""He's a very good representative and advocate of reason triumphing over faith,"" said Kitcher, who used to have his students read Candide over winter break. Goethe, the most recent author dropped from Literature Humanities, might not be permanently gone, according to Seidel. ""Some [authors] drop off and then are put back on with the intent to vary the works a bit. There have been 12 different Euripides plays and as many Shakespeare."" And Demosthenes and Horace? As far as can be determined from the backlogs of CC and Lit Hum, these two authors, one a Greek orator and the other a Roman poet, have never been on either of the syllabi. They were merely favorites of Nicholas Murray Butler. So, if you really want to say that you've ""read all of Butler,"" start cracking the books—you've missed a few."
390,Beta Is Back With Brotherhood And a 92 Inch Flat-Screen TV!,7 February 2005,"By Caitlin Connolly-Rankin Columbia Daily SpectatorFive years ago, Beta Theta Pi was shut down on charges of drug abuse and bad behavior. Now, this same frat boasts a new set of member standards and, at 92 inches, the biggest flat screen television of any frat in the nation. After its disbanding in 2000, the future of Beta's chapter at Columbia, Alpha Alpha, was in question. But members of CC 'O6 came together in 2002 to recreate a Beta with new standards for membership and more than a million dollars for improvements to theirbrownstone on 114 th St The students who took on the challenge of rebuilding Beta nearly from scratch based their new frat on a grounding principle of brotherhood. Without older brothers to guide them, new Beta brothers have created their own rules and traditions. They initially required that all brothers maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.75 and stipulated that the house be a dry one. ""In short, it's a shifting of focus from drinking to more intellectual endeavors,"" said David Caldwell, CC 'O6, vice president of BetaHe added that the fraternity is currently building a library in its house that will house sets of Literature Humanities books for common use. Beta, formerly a wrestling frat is now ""a different kind of fraternity experience,"" said Wayne Ting, CC 'O6, a new brother. ""It was a very different Beta that was disbanded."" Current Betas feel they have exceeded expectations originally set out for them. This year, according to Ting, Beta brothers have the highest GPA in the fraternity system, and they now require that every pledge do community service. Members say they have kept their promises not to drink in the house, believing that brotherhood should be about a ""shared communal experience ... not so much getting plastered,"" according to Ting. These changes to the philosophy of Columbia's Betas mirror changes in the philosophy of the national Beta umbrella organization. After Beta chapters across the country were forced to close because of behavioral problems,the Beta Theta Pi organization began the ""Men of Principle Initiative,"" which aims to improve the quality of life within Beta The initiative proscribes that the brotherhood ""aids the individual, builds the Fraternity, and strengthens the host academic institution through lifelong devotion to intellectual excellence, high standards of moral conduct and responsible citizenship,"" according to its national web site. Ting describes the new Columbia Beta brother as someone who ""has this man of principle within him."" In the past two years, he said, Betas have included four class presidents, many vafsity sports members, and other brothers who are very active on campus. They were, he said, ""new guys who had new ideas about a new frat"" ""Its not like a lot of fraternities,"" said Dan Free, CC 'OB, a Beta member and the only first-year in Greek housing. ""We like to get people who come here for the principles, who share the same ideas."" Beta alumni, impressed with the improvements to Columbia's brotherhood, decided to donate some of the$1.5 million needed to renovate the five-floor Beta house at 550 114 th St; the rest came from fund-raising. The renovations included wireless internet embedded between the first and second floors and the new big screen television. The Beta house is the only traditional fraternity at Columbia owned by alumni instead of the University. The alumni work directly with Columbia Housing and Dining because the neighbors are mostly Columbia residents. While Beta is treated by Columbia in much the same way as other frats, the University doesn't provide it with some of the same resources it provides to the others, like toilet paper. But during the renovations, Columbia employees helped wire the Beta house's telephones. According to Hikaru Kozuma, associate director at the Dean of Student Affairs Office, who works as a liaison between the University and its various fraternities and sororities, said no conflicts exist between Columbia and the Beta alumni or the national Beta organizations. ""You'd be surprised at how self-suf-ficient the groups here are,"" said Ko-zuma who helps with policies, procedures, advising, and resources for event planning. The perception of Beta by other members of Greek life is mixed. ""I like the dudes in Beta,"" said Kalonji Perry, CC 'O6, who is the president of Pi Kappa Alpha Others aren't as impressed by Beta's new attitude. ""The bottom line is they're a bunch of winners,"" said a sarcastic Jonah Van Bourg, CC 'O7, a member of Pi Kappa Alpha According to the Inter-Greek Council, there is no animosity between the chapters. ""Ifs a really unique community here"", said Emily Ross, CC 'O6, President of the IGC. ""I feel like we're a really great community, and I feel like more people should know that"" said Ross, who feels that many students think fraternities exist just for parties. She is helping the IGC in attempts to change this by coordinating a community service drive and a Greek Week on campus. Beta might seem a little calmer than the rest but with a 92-inch flat screen, their Super Bowl party on Sunday was sure to attract some rowdy friends.Though they have a reputation for being the nice guys of the Columbia Greek scene, the Betas demonstrate their wilder side with a 92-inch fiat-screen TV.Having raised over a million dollars to renovate their house, the Betas now live in the lap of luxury. Theirs is the only alumni-owned house at Columbia."
391,Contributor You Want Fries With That Essay?,2 March 2005,"You Want Fries With That Essay?By Stephan SchwartzRemember back to when you were in the third grade. You thought an essay was a bunch of words that you had to put in a specific order that took time away from your playing outside in the sun. Your teacher tells you that it isn't that difficult. Contrary to what you originally thought, you learn that an essay is actually like a hamburger. The bun is the introductory paragraph, the tomato, lettuce, and burger are each body paragraphs (if you want a fourth body paragraph, you can make it a cheeseburger; if you're a vegetarian, the burger can bte a veggie burger), and the conclusion is the other half of the bun. Sound like a simplistic research process? It does to me, yet this is only a slight exaggeration of the writing process that students are required to undergo in the relatively new University Writing course that replaced Logic and Rhetoric two years ago. University Writing is no different than a basic writing course at any university in the country and is probably more demeaning than most. While the articles that students read in the class are well chosen and are definitely thought provoking, the writing process is a joke. The ""critical lens"" essay concept is fine, but the ""constellation"" essay and ""critical collaborative project"" were nothing more than dressed-up garbage. I don't want the hypotheses in the articles I read reduced to three sentences. I want to learn about these ideas in their historical and philosophical contexts so that I can fully appreciate them. I can read those texts in plenty of other classes. These ill-defined and poorly thought-out concept maps weren't the fault of my teacher, who was just distributing the handouts she was given, but of the department which is simply riding the latest trend in teaching students how to write. Due to the graduate students' strike, most students who took University Writing last spring were luckyenough to be spared the painstakingly useless process of actually writing and presenting a ""critical collaborative project"". Unfortunately, unless the Core office reexamines the usefulness of this course, most students in the years to come will not be so lucky. The problem with University Writing is that you can't teach someone how to examine and formulate ideas any more than you can teach them how to think. Unfortunately for students who don't know how to think, the two are closely related. Teaching students how to understand and analyze the complex ideas discussed in Foucault's Discipline and Punish or Edward Said's Orientalism can't be done in a semester if the students don't already have the foundations or the ability. It is essential that students understand and fully discuss the readings in their historical, political, and academic contexts if they are to benefit from the readings. These books should not be chosen simply to illustrate their author's writing techniques in a vacuum. It would be possible to design a course that taught grammar, spelling, and vocabulary, but if I felt that I needed to take McEssay 101, I would have gone to my community college. It would be impractical to propose an entirely new class here, so I won't recommend one. Instead of making each new class of students suffer through University Writing, the Core office might consider taking the principles of Logic and Rhetoric to other Core classes and emphasizing the importance of logical argumentation in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. There's nothing wrong with trying to help students formulate their ideas, but an essay isn't a sandwich. College students need a focus. They don't need buzzwords, concept maps, or Venn diagrams. What better place to get a useful context than in an actual literature, philosophy, or history class?The author is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in political science."
392,Seeing Beyond the Scribbles,29 March 2005,"By Jen Thetford Columbia Daily SpectatorCy Twombly's work can, at times, appear disturbingly similar to a scribbled drawing that your three-year-old brother proudly handled you over the spring break. But something about his art makes it different from the average preschool artistic endeavor. The exhibit, Cy Twombly: Fifty Years of Works on Paper (now on view at the Whitney), introduces him as ""one of the most influential American artists of the last century and today."" But this exceedingly bold statement has some truth to it. While at times it can be difficult to see the ""art"" in Twombly's work, it is definitely there. The exhibit traces Twombly's career, beginning with bold black prints from the 1950s and ending with paintings completed as recently as 2002, which burst with color and flavor. The chronological layout of the display successfully presents Twombly's development as an artist, as he has adopted and disregarded certain ;styles over the past fifty years. All of the work is abstract yet uncomplicated, and the media Twombly uses are extremelybasic: pencils, house paint, and crayons. Perhaps his most simple pieces, at least technically, comprise the Untitled (1956) group. These drawings are essentially just pencil scribbles on plain white paper. The emphasis on the freedom of line and of the artist in pieces such as these is just as noteworthy as even the most complex artistic creations. As the collection progresses, Twombly's work becomes somewhat more frenetic, although it always maintains a hint of minimalism. For example, Bolsena (1969), completed in felt pen and colored pencil, is a series of numbers and doodles of basic shapes. The rest of the paper is left blank so that all the emphasis is placed on these random notations, a technique which forces the viewer to stop and examine them in depth. Of particular interest to Columbia students who have completed the Literature Humanities course may be Twombly's fascination with epic literature. A number of his pieces explore the nature of characters from ancient Greek and Roman stories. These pieces usually have the name of the character written in a bold, striking color, under which are words that Twombly associates with that person.For example, in Venus (1975), the word ""Venus"" is written in intense bright red block letters, and under them a red and black cloud is pasted onto the paper. Admittedly, the words under the Venus are not in English and thus hard to appreciate; but the piece works together as a whole and is quite evocative. Twombly introduces paint in some of his later works. These pieces remain completely abstract as warm colored paint is smeared onto paper in a random, disorganized fashion. The exhibit concludes with books of paper with similar paint smearings. Interestingly, Twombly loaned these books to the Whitney for the exhibition but are to be returned soon after because they contain some ideas he has been working on for later pieces. This in and of itself is striking, for it shows that each of Twombly's pieces are deliberate and meaningful. Twombly's work is free and wild; it allows the viewer to read as much or as little into it as he or she wishes. One could simply brush off this collection as an assortment of scribbles. But to accept the challenge to see something beyond those scribbles, or simply to go enjoy them, is a truly worthwhile experience."
393,GSEU Strike Begins With Walkout First Day of Week-Long Strike Features Off-Campus Protest; Few Classes Cancelled,19 April 2005,"First Day of Week-Long Strike Features Off-Campus Protest; Few Classes CancelledBy Rebecca Aronauer Spectator Senior Staff WriterWith screams, drums beats, whistles, and the giant inflatable union rat Graduate Student Employees United started their one-week strike for union recognition early yesterday. By 8:30 am., GSEU's second walk-out in two years had commenced. The strike's principle demand, union recognition, remains the same, but things have changed for GSEU in the past year. The National Labor Relations Board ruled last summer that graduate students at private universities are not employees. The one-week strike is an appeal for recognition thatthe administration is not legally required to make. GSEU members and supporters protested outside the Columbia gates all day. Between 80 and 100 members went to City Hall for a New York City Council Committees on Labor and Higher Education hearing on union rights in higher education in the early afternoon. CUNY faculty, NYU graduate assistants, and Columbia MD/ Ph.D. student and research assistant Etay Ziv testified. ""Ifs fantastic to see so much support from public officials and city councils,"" said David Wolach, a GSEU member currently on leave from the philosophy department. Althoughstarting the strike five miles away from campus may seem counter-intuitive, organizers thought the hearing would be a good public forum to denounce the University. ""The hearing was a great opportunity to call the University to task and it was an opportunity we did not want to miss,"" Wolach said. How successful this year's strike will be is unclear. Last year, the administration did its best to ignore the fourweek strike and now it has the National Labor Relations Board's ruling to support its anti-union position. Still, graduate students believe that the shortened strike will be more intense than last year's and will pressure the Universityinto recognizing GSEU. ""Ifs much more serious this year,"" said Roy Tzohar, a second-year religion graduate student and TA for East Asian Buddhism. ""Everyone is getting more desperate and it seems to me that the University is less tolerant to the strike."" ""I think the one-week strike will be more effective at raising awareness that the issue is still important for us,"" said Michael Brent, a second year philosophy graduate student and TA for Recent European Philosophy. Last year's strike affected first-years, sophomores, and professors withlarge lectures the most. For the last two weeks of the semester, core and language classes with striking preceptors did not meet and professors with striking TAs had to grade all their finals. This year, GSEU estimates that most Contemporary Civilization and University Writing preceptors are striking. UW preceptors also delivered a letter to President Bollinger's office yesterday urging union recognition; 51 preceptors signed the letter. The Literature Humanities and CC departments have decided not to have faculty teach striking Lit Hum and CC sections. ""Both chairs, for different reasons, chose not to ask faculty to cover classes,"" said Deborah Martinsen, acting director of the Core Curriculum. year, Professors David Armitage and Jim Zetzel taught missed CC sections. Frustrated sophomores petitioned for incompletesand then for pass/fail grades, even putting stickers on their blue books saying the exam ""compromises the academic integrity of my Contemporary Civilization experience."" Since this year's strike is only lasting a week, the long-term impact should be less severe on students. ""This year, I don't know any of my TAs who are striking,"" said Olivia Roszkowski, CC 'O7. ""Last year, 1 didn't have any classes on campus except for sciences."" In the Spanish department, four graduate student preceptors out of 24 were out though more may be out today. As ill the Core Curriculum departments, Spanish department faculty will not make up any classes. ""We are assessing the situation, and right now it's contained,"" said Professor Angelina Craig-Florez, director of the Language Program. The Italian and French departments did not report official tallies of striking graduate students. Like last year, the administration hopesto limit the strike's effects on students. In an announcement posted on the University Web site on Friday, Provost Alan Brinkley wrote, ""the University's first priority will be to ensure minimal disruption to the lives of students at Columbia and to assist undergraduates whose classes are affected by the walkout"" The statement reaffirmed the administration's position that graduate students are not Columbia employees. ""The University's relationsliip with graduate students, however, is an educational and collaborative one; it is not an employer-em-ployee relationship."" In the post Brinkley called the strike a ""walkout"" by some graduate student teaching fellows and research assistants; he did not refer to GSEU by name. Today strike organizers are planning a noon speak-out with graduate students, undergraduates, and faculty members on academic freedom and collective bargaining.

394,Editorial Nothing to Hide Registration should be more transparent,20 April 2005,"Nothing to HideRegistration should be more transparentAh, registration week. It's a time to plan your future, to take a gamble on new passions—and, if you're a Columbia College student, to renew your frustration with the secrecy that prevails in a majority of the College's departments. Despite students' annual requests for more transparency, the Center for the Core Curriculum still declines to publicize the names of Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities teachers ahead of time, and most humanities departments still choose not to place the results of course evaluations online. Administrators seem to be trying to keep students deliberately misinformed about the quality of instruction available in the College. They should instead be spending their energy insuring that this quality is uniformly excellent. The Center for the Core Curriculum doesn't yet know which instructors will be teaching what CC and Lit Hum sections in the fall. The office will know by September, but acting Director Deborah A. Martinsen wrote in an e-mail that the Center will keep mum about names through fall registration ""in fairness to the students who have registered without knowing instructors' names."" She and her staff fear that if the Center publishes teachers' names during registration, a large number of students would petition to change sections, and the Center ""does not have the staff or time to fine-tune every. student's schedule."" The Center shouldn't have to playmatchmaker between teachers and students. It ought to realize, however, that if there are obvious inconsistencies in the quality of Core instruction, it should not be hiding that from students. Rather, it should be working to improve the level of instruction to the point where mass exoduses are no longer an imminent threat. As the Center for the Core keeps quiet on teachers' names, so do most College departments on teachers' abilities. Only a handful of departments —among them economics and sociology—post the results of annual course evaluations online. Academic Affairs Dean Kathryn Yatrakis said that the Committee on Instruction allows individual departments to decide whether or not to post evaluations. She added that faculty in most departments think that since evaluations are meant to help instructors improve, they are best kept private, away from ""the eyes of Spectator and the world."" This is Columbia—what do the College's departments have to hide? If a professor gets uniformly bad reviews from his or her students, that individual should not be teaching here. When discussing whether or not it was important to put evaluations online, Yatrakis asked, ""What do students really need to know?"" We need to know that our University provides us with only the best teaching, or at least that it gives us enough information to make informed decisions about our classes."
395,"GSEU Strikers Return To the Classroom Opinion Split on Effects of One-Week Strike, Administration Still Not Willing to Negotiate",25 April 2005,"Opinion Split on Effects of One-Week Strike, Administration Still Not Willing to NegotiateBy John Davisson Spectator Staff WriterAcross the University, graduate preceptors, instructors, teaching assistants, and research assistants will return to their classes today, one week after Graduate Student Employees United began its second strike in as many years. While many will return fresh from the picket lines, armed with firsthand accounts of the labor trenches, others will continue teaching uninterrupted, unfazed, and unmoved by the efforts of their peers. The question of how many of each, exactly, is an open one. ""My sense is that it had broad support,"" said Maurice Leutenegger, a GSEU organizer and RA in the physics department. ""It would be hard to imagine that it wouldn't have some impact."" Though the effectiveness of the strike remains uncertain, GSEU's presence was quite visible during the week. Members conducted daily picket lines outside the 116 th Street gates, participated in rallies near campus and downtown, and testified at a hearing of the New York City Council Committees on Laborand Higher Education. The strike was also coordinated with that of Graduate Employees and Students Organization, Yale's counterpart to GSEU. ""Whether they like to admit it or not, we had a major impact on the University during the week of the strike,"" said David Wolach, a GSEU organizer. ""The University administration has been thoroughly embarrassed."" Lytton Smith, a second year student in the Graduate School of the Arts and University Writing instructor, expressed doubt about GSEU's methods, including the recent strike. ""I can understand why they're doing what they're doing, but I just now feel like we're caught in a deadlock position where the University's not going to budge,"" Smith said. Provost Alan Brinkley downplayed the effect of the strike on the University's operation. ""It's not trivial, but it wasn't enormous either,"" Brinkley said. ""Like last year, it was concentrated mostly in the Core, and it did have a significant impact, especially onUniversity Writing, also on CC and Lit Hum. We don't have specific numbers, but a very large proportion of those sections did not meet."" Last Thursday, through interviews and independent e-mail polling, Spectator attempted to gauge the strike participation of the 168 precepts and instructors who currently lead sections of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and University Writing, the five courses believed most widely affected by the strike. Of the 93 respondents, 65 percent reported having cancelled all of their classes, 2 percent reported having cancelled only some of their classes, and 33 percent reported that they held all of their sections. Of those who held class, 20 percent reported having conducted at least one class off-campus. Eighty percent of those cancelling classes said that they had or intended to participate in GSEUorganized strike events. Polling did not include precepts, TAs, or RAs serving in other departments and does not necessarily reflect participation across the broader graduate population. The data suggests that a large majority of TAs from the five sampled Core classes chose to respect the strike action, but the numbers fall short of the 80-plus percent support that GSEU reported from its strike vote. Professor Joseph Bizup, director of the Undergraduate Writing Program, said that though a ""great many"" sections of University Writing did not meet, professors were not asked to stand-in forstriking instructors. ""Pedagogically, it doesn't make sense to cover a class with someone for one week when the students have been working on their writing with another instructor all semester,"" Bizup said. Professor Deborah Martinsen, acting director of the Core Curriculum, estimated that ""slightly over half' of Lit Hum precepts and three-quarters of CC precepts were not in their classrooms during the week. ""Some of them are out on strike, some of them are just not in their classroom,"" Martinsen said, referring to a small segment of graduate teachers who moved classes to off-campus locations. Like University Writing, the classes were not otherwise covered. GSEU organizers were hopeful about the long-term outcome of the unionization movement. ""The only criteria that we have to know if we succeed at some point is if they agree to negotiate with us, but that doesn't mean we failed if they didn't immediately agree to do so,"" Leutenegger said. Brinkley expressed openness to a dialogue on the concerns of graduates. ""[President Bollinger] said last year that he believed that we should have a discussion within the community about this and that it shouldn't just be his decision as to what we do,"" he explained. ""It's something that we would be open to discussing in the community, but it would be a discussion that would certainly have to include the faculty."" To date, the University has maintained that graduate teachers are fundamentally students and not employees.GSEU STRIKE POLL Are you cancelling your classes this week as part of the strike?

396,Letters to the Editor,1 May 2005,"To THE EDITOR: Fifteen things you should know about Columbia for the 111 th Annual Varsity Show: 1. Columbia's Core Curriculum is a set of required classes, including Literature Humanities, which revolves around the Western canon. The reading list is often criticized for its focus on male authors. 2. SEAS, also known as the Fu Foundation, is the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. 3. Kathryn Yatrakis is the (sexy) dean of Academic Affairs. 4. CU Snacks is a student-run business that makes late-night deliveries to dorm rooms. 5. The ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps, wants to recruit on campus again. Columbia's anti-discrimination regulations, however, conflicts with the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy. 6. TAs, or Teaching Assistants, are graduate students who teach many of Columbia's Core classes. They are underpaid, embittered, and prone to striking.7. Most Columbia students do not have class on Fridays. 8. There's this dude who totally jerks off in Butler Library. Seriously. 9. The School at Columbia is an elementary school on 110 th Street established by the University. 10. The Facebook, found at www. thefacebook.com, is an online social network that connects people at colleges. Users can set up profiles, join groups, and accumulate ""friends."" 11. The Hungarian Pastry Shop is a coffeehouse on Amsterdam Avenue that's frequented by an elitist clientele. 12. NYU has it coming. 13. Coach Jones is the coach of the Columbia men's basketball team. He often leaves messages on students' room phones. 14. The beds in dorm rooms are not meant for two people. 15. The Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures department—the MEALAC department —is involved in a scandal concerning student intimidation. A documentary about these accusations, Columbia Unbecoming, fueled the controversy.CHRIS WELLS, CC 'O6, PHILIPPA AINSLEY, CC 'O7, AND ADDISON ANDERSON, CC 'O7 THE AUIHORS ARE THE WRITERS OF THE LLLTH ANNUAL VARSITY SHOW APRIL 22,2005 To THE EDITOR: When paired with words that are not funny, the sound of music can be harsh. So goes this year's Varsity Show. If we've seen it once, we've seen it 110 times: Barnard girls are easily romanced. Engineers are socially uncomfortable. Columbia's advising system leaves something to be desired. We whistle a happy tune when we think back to our old days writing the show. So in February we attended the preview at the West End. Now, they haven't always done the preview there: in years past, we even heard the cast singing in the Abbey. This year, we've found that getting to know this cast and crew—getting to know all about this cast and crew—has been tough on us. The jokes just aren't as funny as they used to be. We don't know exactly how to explain it. How do you catch a cloud and pin it down? It just seemsthat the acting, the writing, and the music don't have the energy they once did. We've never known how to solve a problem like that. But we have always tried to close with an upbeat number, so we'll leave with a thought for those who will work on the 112 th Varsity Show: the future still looms bright. Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart. And you'll never walk alone. RICHARD RODGERS, CC '23, AND OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN, CC 'l6 APRIL 20, 2005 t [ To THE EDITOR: In the article ""Homer Hosts The Varsity Show"", which points out that this year's Varsity Show relies on a certain greatest poet ever, the writer speaks with everyone from the stars of the show to the musical directors.

No one told Mr. Barbour that I've been here all along, even if The Varsity Show's production team hasn't acknowledged me. Remember those first two books you read in Lit Hum?Yeah, I wrote them. I don't see what's so good about The Varsity Show anyway. They've consistently failed to attract the most talented stars at Columbia, instead falling back on a cast of over-dra-matic theater dorks who came here because they wanted to live in New York but weren't man enough to apply to Julliard. This year they use me as a plot device and give me a profile on thefacebook.com. Shameful. Who do they think they are, Dante? There's a lot I could have offered the writers of this year's show, if only they had let me contribute. Columbia has much in common with my work. Look at the Trojans and Columbia's athletics program, or the entire student population and long-suffering, self-involved Achilles. But instead some boy from Varsity Shows past will play me. He might have been able to handle playing Lee Bollinger (or ""Prez Bo,"" as he was ""cleverly"" dubbed by the show two years ago), but the most talented writer in all of western literature might be a bit out of his league.

397,GRADUATE STUDENT UNIONIZATION GSEU Holds Strike For Second Year One Week Walkout Coincided With Similar Yale Strike,9 May 2005,"GSEU Holds Strike For Second YearOne Week Walkout Coincided With Similar Yale StrikeBy John Davisson Spectator Staff WriterFor the second time in as many years, graduate student preceptors, instructors, teaching assistants, and research assistants took to the picket lines this spring in an ongoing movement to earn collective bargaining rights with the University. While their efforts fell against a new legal backdrop, the fundamental arguments and the familiar standoff were the same. Nearly five years after the formation of Graduate Student Employees United, the organization leading the pro-union charge, parties remained deadlocked on the employment status of graduate student teachers. While GSEU asserts that their service to the University qualifies them as full-fledged employees, Columbia's administration maintains that they are fundamentally students and are therefore not entided to a union. GSEU put a referendum to its membership in the early spring, just as it had done in 2004. On the evening of April 13, organizers announced that ""over 80 percent"" of members had elected to carry out a second large-scale strike, scheduled to last from April 18 to April 22. ""Based on the overwhelming support for this plan, that GSEU voted to strike collectively, we are going ahead with the strike,"" said David Wolach, a GSEU organizer and graduate student in the history department who declined to release an exact vote tally. GSEU members cite a wide range of reasons to pursue unionization, including inadequate stipends, poor health coverage, and their importance to the day-to-day functioning of the University. 'When we withhold our labor, that highlights'the value of our service, and thafs something the University needs to recognize,"" said Erik Goldner, also a GSEU organizer and graduate student in the history department Administration officials counter that most TAs and preceptors receive the best financial aid packages of any Columbia students, and that their teaching roles are a necessary part of their education, not a stand-alone means of employment During the strike, many classrooms were emptied of their instructors as the 116 th gates flooded with graduate students and union sympathizers. They arrived each morning with pick-"" 1 at signs, slogans, noisemakers, and, on occasion, a giant inflatable rat prepared to give a voice and a face to the union movement The strike ""moves you closer to recognition,"" said Maurice Leutenegger, a GSEU member and physics research assistant 'We don't know what the administration tipping point is. No one ever knows when their employer will cave and recognize them, but we do know there is such a point From a practical standpoint there's a palpable sense of gaining momentum."" The strike effort included several high-profilerallies, attended variously by AFL-CIO president John Sweeney, Unite Here! President John Wilhelm, Rev. Jesse Jackson, city officials, and hundreds of members of both the AFL-CIO and the graduate students' would-be umbrella union, the United Auto Workers. GSEU also coordinated its strike with that of Graduate Employees and Students Organization, Yale's equivalent graduate student body. Several busloads of GESO members traveled to Morningside Heights on April 18 to attend a joint labor rally. As similar as it appeared to the 2004 strike, this year's dispute was conducted under new legal and tactical developments. In July 2004, the National Labor Relations Board, which holds federal authority over unionization matters, ruled 3-2 against Brown University's similarly proposed graduate student union. ""There is a significant risk, and indeed a strong likelihood, that the collective-bargaining process will be detrimental to the educational process,"" the ruling read. ""We declare federal law to be that graduate assistants are not employees."" The decision reversed a 2000 NLRB decision that had upheld the collective bargaining rights of New York University's graduate instructors, who are unionized. During last year's GSEU strike, many graduate students cited the NYU precedent as a validation of their cause. In 2002, the NLRB conducted a unionization vote among Columbia's graduate student teachers. But Columbia filed an appeal soon after that vote, and the NLRB impounded the ballots pending its decision. Based on the most r|cent NLRB decision, the University won its apjSeal last August and the ballots were destroyed""without being tallied. As a result of the ruling, GSEU did not enjoy the legal protection or mediation of the NLRB this year. The graduate students' efforts tried to get the University to do something that the law no longer requires and that the administration has consistently said it will not do: granting them collective bargaining rights. Also different this year was the format of the strike. In 2004, the GSEU vote called for an openended walkout, which was brought to an end after one month through the mediation of state and city officials. This year's effort, though also calling for professors to hold classes off campus and all graduate students to boycott classes, was Strictly limited to a single week. GSEU organisers argued that concentrating their efforts into a shorter period would achieve a more visible effect. That graduate student teachers are distributed across so many departments and teaching roles makes it difficult to judge the full impact of the strike. A Spectator poll projected that about 65 percent of graduate student instructors and preceptors in Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, University Writing, and Art andMusic Humanities chose to strike. Many have suggested that these Core classes, most of which are led by humanities, social sciences, and arts graduate students, were most affected by the strike. Sixty-one percent of Core Classes were cancelled on account of the strike, a number that falls short of the 80 percent support that GSEU reported from its strike vote. The figure does not necessarily reflect the broader impact of the walkout. Whatever the exact totals, there were many graduate student teachers who disagreed with the strike action. Some supported GSEU but opposed this particular tactic, others expressed disgust with GSEU's reportedly aggressive sup-port-building tactics, while still others fundamentally opposed unionization. ""I can understand why they're doing what they're doing, but I just now feel like we're caught in a deadlock position where the University's not goihg to budge,"" said Lytton Smith, a secondyear graduate student in the School for the Arts and University Writing instructor. Smith said that he objected specifically to GSEU's involvement with UAW, which he claimed would unnecessarily entangle graduate students in broader union battles. Even after the strike ended, the controversial issue of graduate student unionization flared again. On April 25, the liberal magazine The Nation published an internal Columbia admin-istration memo on its Web site that discusses possible measures to take against TAs and instructors who chose to strike. ""We should seek to reduce the possibility of future strikes in our response to those teaching fellows who fail to meet their instructional commitments,"" the letter read. Signed in February by Provost Alan Brinkley and addressed to 17 senior administrators, the letter also considers requiring extra instructional commitments and withdrawing award eligibility from striking graduate students. There is no evidence that any of the included proposals were enacted, but the language is a sharp departure from past public statements. Brinkley has previously emphasized that graduate students should not face retribution for their decision to strike. ""I don't think it's dangerous f<ir people to discuss options,"" Briiikley said in defense of the memo as a private weighSfi£""6f ofitianS. ""Whaffe important is what we do, not the proposals people might make."" Several GSEU members brought up the memo at a contentious April 26 meeting of the Graduate Student Advisory Council, the Univer-sity-recognized graduate student government, taking the opportunity to lash out at GSAC's stance of neutrality on the strike. A letter condemning the memo was also recently delivered to Brinkley on behalf of 46 graduate studentsfrom his own history department ""Whether or not we favor graduate unionization,"" it read, ""we all agree that intimidation and retribution have no place in a university that values academic freedom."" Since the strike, the administration has not signaled any policy changes nor has GSEU publicly backed down. Thus, the future of the unionization movement remains, as it always has, uncertain. Brinkley, while reiterating the University's present stance against the unionization of graduate students, said he was open to a dialogue on the subject President Bollinger ""said last year that he believed 1 that we should have a discussion within the community about this and that it shouldn't just be his decision as to what we do. Fc>r a range of reasons, mostly because we had other things going on this year, we didn't dd that this year, although we had hoped to,"" Brinkley said. GSEU organizers said that they will consider future actions over the summer and continue to speak optimistically about their efforts. ""Whether they like to admit it or not we had a major impact on the University during the week of the strike.... We hope that the University will recognize that it will do the right thing and that it'll recognize our union in the next few weeks,"" Wolach said.Graduate students on strike marched in front of the Broadway gates for a week this spring to pressure the University for recognition."
398,"Lecture Showdowns, Uptown Expansion, Picket Lines—Just Another Year at CU",30 August 2005,"The last few years have seen a number of headline issues strike Morningside Heights - some of them even made national news, only to peter out somewhere in the administrative jungle inside Low Library. Here's a rundown on some of the biggest that are likely to remain important this year. The MEALAC Controversy The word MEALAC rumbled through campus last year, becoming short-hand for a weighty, complex, and still-unresolved controversy that shook Columbia and gained national attention. The debate focused on accusations of anti-Israel intimidation by professors, leaving the department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures (MEALAC) in turmoil, but also present were numerous threads of long-standing political, religious, and academic battles. At the center of the storm was a video recorded in winter 2003 by a number of Jewish undergraduate students documenting allegations of anti-Israel verbal abuse by professors. The film was initially shown in fall 2004 to a few members of the administration in closed screenings. When word began reaching alumni and other groups, students began screening the film, called ""Columbia Unbecoming,"" to small audiences on campus. The peak of the controversy came in November 2004, with CNN producing a clip and the New York Daily News running front page articles with headlines like ""Hatred 101"" and referring to Columbia as a ""Poison Ivy."" In campus discussion, student (and outside) concerns moved beyond the specific incidents mentioned in the film to encompass what was characterized a general anti-Israel slant to the MEALAC department, and Middle East studies in general at Columbia At the end of the fall semester, Columbia President Lee Bollinger appointed an ad hoc faculty committee to investigate the complaints. The resulting report released in April, avoided any consideration of the Middle East studies curriculum, instead limiting itself to a detailed evaluation of the University's grievance channels. The committee issued a harsh condemnation of Columbia's procedures for dealing with academic grievances and advising channels, saying that students' complaints about Middle East studies professors were ignored or mishandled for years by being shuffled between various administrators. Like the committee, the major figures in Columbia's administration walked a delicate line between the students' complaints and the professors accused of misconduct In a series of public statements, University President Lee Bollinger offered a nuanced defense of academic freedom but said that professorial autonomy has limits. The ad hoc committee said it found no evidence of anti-Sem-itism, and addressed only three of the most highly publicized allegations of intimidation - two involving assistant professor Joseph Massad and one involving professor George Saliba. Of the three incidents, the committee found one to be ""credible:"" an incident in spring 2002 when Massad allegedly shouted at a student to get out of his class because she was defending Israeli military conduct The committee said Massad violated standard norms of acceptable professorial conduct Two other students interviewed by the committee corroborated the account but Massad has staunchly denied it Soon after the report was released, 20 of Massad's former students who say they were enrolled in the class signed a petition denying the exchange ever occurred. Meanwhile, the University slowly revamped its grievance channels, resulting in an flurry of new policies that were announced at the end of the spring semester. The changes include internal revisions to individual schools' policies, as well as several new University- wide measures. At the center of the new policies was the formation of a permanent five member faculty committee in Arts and Sciences. The committee will hear student grievances that could not be reconciled through more informal channels, like student advising, or students can bring grievances directly to the committee. This is a sharp departure from previous decisions to allow each indidivual school within the University to determine all disciplinary measures. The vice president for Arts and Sciences, Nicholas Dirks, will decide whether to adopt the committee's recommendations, and students can appeal the decision to the provost Alan Brinkley, who has the final say. At the same time, Bollinger announced the establishment of a new President's Council on Student Affairs, a small panel of student representatives from across the University that will meet regularly with top administrators to discuss student issues, but by the end of the semester there had been no more details announced. Manhattanville Columbia is growing uptown. Over the next 30 years, the University plans to expand into an area of West Harlem known as Manhattanville. The multibillion dollar plan calls for a new campus stretching from 125 th to 133 rd Streets between Broadway and the Hudson River, containing science and research labs, a new School of the Arts, and residential and academic buildings. The expansion is designed to alleviate the space crunch that has existed at Columbia for years. Columbia has the lowest space-to-student ratio in the Ivy League. Right now, Manhattanville looks nothing like a college campus in the making. It is one of the last remaining manufacturing areas in New York City, populated by auto repair shops, warehouses, and moving and storage companies, as well as some residential buildings. Columbia says its plans will help the neighborhood. It esti-mates that the Manhattanville project will create 14,000 jobs. But many residents are skeptical. They doubt that the new jobs will go to local residents. Led by a group called the Coalition to Preserve Community, they worry that Columbia's presence will cause rents to rise and ultimately force them out of their homes. They fear that new labs will conduct biotech research and pose a public health hazard. Community Board 9, the most local governmental entity, has come up with its own blueprint for development in the area, known as a 197-a plan. The 197-a differs in a few significant ways with Columbia's plan. Columbia currently owns 42% of the land in the proposed expansion area. The University wants to own all the land before going forward with its plans. But some of the property owners say they won't sell. Columbia has asked the state to consider using eminent domain, the power by which the government can forcibly buy private property for public use, to take the land and turn it over to the University. Despite a recent Supreme Court ruling saying eminent domain can be used to promote economic development the property owners vow to fiercely resist this tactic. The University says it is a last resort Before Columbia can start building in Manhattanville, it needs to get the area's zoning designation changed from manufacturing to mixed use to allow construction of academic halls, labs, and dorms. This fall the University will enter into the Uniform Land Use Review Process (ULURP), to garner approval for its rezoning plans from several levels of government Columbia will also have to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), outlining the likely environmental fallout from the proposed changes. The ULURP process, which typically takes between six months and a year, must be successfully completed before Columbia can start turning its elaborate plans for Manhattanville into reality. Graduate Student Unionization Union, NOW! Union, now? Despite years of protests and strikes, Columbia's gradu-ate student unionization movement has made little progress. But there's little indication that Graduate Student Employees United (GSEU), the organization leading the pro-union charge, is going to give up any time soon, despite Columbia's refusal to budge on the issue. GSEU's major contention is that the service that graduate student preceptors, teaching assistants, and research assistants perform qualifies them as full-fledged employees of the University. Columbia's administration maintains that they are primarily students and are therefore not entitled to form a union. The same debate In 2002, the National Labor Relations Board, which holds federal authority over unionization matters, polled graduate student teachers to see if they wanted to unionize. But Columbia filed an appeal soon after that vote, and the NLRB impounded the ballots pending a decision. GSEU held internal membership votes in the springs of both 2004 and 2005 on walkout strikes. Both passed. The first year, an open-ended walkout lasted for about a month, and ended right before graduation through the mediation of state and city officials. In August 2004, the University won its appeal before the NLRB and the ballots from 2002 were destroyed without being tallied. The decision came on the back of a ruling earlier that summer on a similar case at Brown University. That vote fell 3-2 against Brown University's similarly proposed graduate student union, reversing a 2000 decision that upheld the collective bargaining rights of New York University's graduate instructors. The 2004 ruling was widely perceived to weaken GSEU's case, and in April 2005 the organization voted for a one-week strike. GSEU organizers argued that concentrating their efforts into a shorter period would achieve a more visible effect During the strike, many classrooms were emptied of their instructors as the 116 th ST. gates flooded with graduate students and union sympathizers. They arrived each morning with picket signs, slogans, noisemakers, and, on occasion, a giant inflatable rat, prepared to give a voice and a face to the union movement The strike effort included several high-profile rallies, attended variously by high profile figures including AFLCIO presidentjohn Sweeney, Unite Here! President John Wilhelm, Rev. Jesse Jackson, city officials, and hundreds of members of both the AFLCIO and the graduate students' would-be umbrella union, the United Auto Workers. GSEU also coordinated its strike with a similar strike at Yale. The distribution of graduate student preceptors across many departments and teaching roles made it difficult to judge the full impact of the strike, but it was widely believed that Core classes were the most heavily affected and humanities classes suffered more than sciences and engineering. The first year, numerous sections of Contemporary Civilizations were with-out instructors, and were administered a uniform final. Last spring, a Spectator survey estimated that around 65 percent of graduate student instructors and preceptors in Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, University Writing, and Art and Music Humanities chose to strike. Whatever the exact totals, many graduate student teachers disagreed with the strike action. Some supported GSEU but opposed this particular tactic, others expressed disgust with GSEU's reportedly aggressive support- building tactics, while still others fundamentally opposed unionization. While GSEU called both strikes successful in raising awareness, the future of the movement at Columbia is unclear. Diversity At a school that prides itself as being one of the most diverse in the Ivy League, the issue of diversity, both among the student body and among professors, continues to inspire controversy, protest, and —most recently—money. This summer, Columbia announced that $l5 million of internal funds would be devoted to diversity hiring initiatives. This is one of a number of steps the University has taken in the past year after a number of efforts in spring 2004 by students and faculty to make the administration deal with Columbia's infrastructure—or lack thereof—to support diversity. In spring 2004, a large number of students held a week-long series of sit-ins on the steps to Low Library to protest controversial events including a cartoon in the humor magazine The Fed and flyers put up by the Columbia University Marching Band that were seen as racially offensive. Hie protesting students said the incidents were indicative of a campus indifference to racism. They called for student input on policies regarding bias-related incidents, revisions of the Core curriculum, and the creation of a central administration position dealing with multicultural affairs. At the same time, some professors were raising concerns over both racial and gender diversity among the faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University division that houses Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Last year, the administration responded to these various concerns in a variety of ways. One of the most visible was the appointment last fall of Jean Howard, a professor of English, to the new three-year position of Vice Provost of Diversity Initiatives. Since then, Howard has focused on increasing the number of women and minorities hired to new faculty positions. Women and racial minorities are chronically under-rep-resented in the faculty of the Arts and Sciences. Although 30 percent of undergraduates belong to minority groups, only 16 percent of faculty members are minorities, according to the Columbia University Statistical Abstract from Fall 2003. According to the University Senate's 2002 ""Pipeline"" report on the advancement of women through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, women made up only one-third of tenure-eligible faculty and less than 20 percent of tenured faculty at that time. Howard is careful to note that the committee was not concerned just with the physical makeup of the faculty body. Inclusive hiring, Howard said, requires that searches be defined broadly, that the composition of search committees themselves be diverse, and that a conscious effort be made to outreach to networks that include diverse candidates. This includes targeting the recipients of prestigious fellowships that support women and minorities in junior faculty appointments. Last fall also marked the opening of the Office of Multicultural Affairs, led by Dean Corlisse Thomas, which is intended to serve as a resource for student concerns regarding issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation on campus. In addition to providing general support and advocacy, the OMA advises the approximately 40 cultural organizations which formerly fell under the jurisdiction of Student Development and Activities. The office was also involved in RA and NSOP training this summer.A student marches with a sign by the Broadway gates to demand that graduate TAs be allowed to form a union (left).

399,"Fellows Office to Split off Applicants Will Report To New Academic Affairs Dean, to Be Named Later",10 October 2005,"Applicants Will Report To New Academic Affairs Dean, to Be Named LaterBy Erin Durkin Spectator Staff WriterColumbia is changing the way it helps fellowship applicants—or at least changing the office to which they report Later this semester, the University will dissolve the Scholars and Fellows Office, which had assisted students in applying for programs like the Rhodes, Marshall, and Truman Scholarships. That responsibility will be overtaken by a new Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for Fellowships, who will be chosen upon completion of a nationwide search. Lavinia Lorch, the current director of the Scholars and Fellows Office, which is part of the Division of Student Affairs, will remain in charge of planning programs for the John Jay, Kluge, Davis, and Global Scholars at Columbia, but will no longer be involved in the fellowship application process. Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis explained that the shift represented a logical consolidation, noting that certain fellowships, including the Fulbright, are already handled by her office. She said while the programmatic work of the Scholars Program is ""done very well in Student Aflairs,"" Academic Affairs is a more appropriate place to handle fellowships. ""It was always a temporary situation,"" she said of Student Affairs' handling fellowships. Compared to past successes, Columbia has performed poorly on fellowships in recent years. In the past two years, no Columbia student has won a Marshall, Rhodes, or Truman Scholarship. Yet Yatrakis maintained that this trend was not the motivation behind the administrative shift. ""Ifs tempting to measure success by the number of successful candidates,"" she said, but added that doing so is unwise because many external factors play into the fellowship selection process. She cited selection committees' increasing desire to select candidates from beyond the Ivy League as one possible reason Columbia's numbers fell. According to Yatrakis, the performance of the new fellowships office should be gauged by how many students are made aware of fellowship opportunities and how many applicants find the process to be worthwhile —regardless of the outcome. ""I think thafs the real measure of how well we do our work,"" she said. ""We're committed to having more students apply and giving them as much support as possible.""The University hopes to finish identifying candidates for the new Associate Dean position by the end of October. The replacement will begin work by the beginning of next semester. Students who began applying for fellowships last year will complete the process with Lorch's office. But those initiating the process this semester are being routed through Academic Affairs, where their applications are handled jointly with Student Affairs until a new dean is chosen. Yatrakis said that specific changes to Columbia's fellowship application process would be left up to the new dean. She mentioned, however, some initiatives to encourage more students to apply, including working with Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization instructors and asking them to identify students who might be good candidates for fellowships. ""This change administratively allows us to have one person dedicated to this and only this—a senior level administrator —that can't help but improve the situation,"" Yatrakis said. Lorch, too, said she welcomed the change. ""I think if s an excellent consolidation of the different offices. I think ifs very important to have one office dedicated entirely to fellowships and related programs,"" she said. But Lorch said that losing her purview over fellowships would not leave her office lacking in responsibilities. ""My work with the scholars keeps me very busy. I think ifs an excellent decision,"" she said.CHANGES FOR STUDENTS At the end of the semester, Columbia will eliminate the Scholars and Fellows office. • Students applying for distinctions such as the Rhodes, Marshall, and Truman Scholarships will be served by a new Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for Fellowships. • The current director of the Scholars and Fellows office, Lavinia Lorch, will continue to coordinate programs for the John Jay, Kluge, Davis, and Global Scholars at Columbia."
400,Ex-CU Prof. Takes Lit Hum to Harvard Prof. James Russell Now Teaches 'Core' Class at Harvard as a Popular First-Year Seminar,28 November 2005,"Prof. James Russell Now Teaches 'Core' Class at Harvard as a Popular First-Year SeminarBy Anna Phillips Columbia Daily SpectatorHarvard is nurturing a Columbia transplant It's not an invasive species native to College Walk; rather, if s a sample of a Core Curriculum staple— Literature Humanities. Former Columbia and current Harvard professor James R Russell is teaching a revised version of CU's beloved (or bemoaned) class as a first-year seminar entitled Literature Humanities: The Foundation Texts of the West Russell taught the class, which he refers to as a ""humanistic equivalent of Marine basic training,"" as a tutorial last year. This year he's opened the class to 15 first-years. '1 figure that wherever you work, you have to bring the best of what you know and what yourexperience is. Harvard students deserve an exposure to general education rather than courses that just emphasize theory,"" Russell said. But Russell has done more than copy and paste the course —he's changed some of the material. The class contains the old standards: Lattimore's Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, it the works of Herodotus and Thucydides are i iissing. Aristophanes' Lysistrata has been replaced with The Frogs, and the Bhagavad-Gita and The Gathas ofZarathustra appear halfway through the course, adding the influences of ancient India and Iran to the original Hebrew and Hellenic mix. ""One speaks about the intellectual heritage of the West I think that nowadays, at least for Americans, that definition has to include places that our fellow Americans come from,"" Russell said.While it initially met with skepticism on the part of the university, Russell's course receives rave reviews from his students, as does Russell himself. The course is ""cultural literacy, almost because [the class texts] are foundations for everything thafs been done later,"" student Sally Kiebdaj said. Fellow Harvard student Alex Pickett echoed her sentiment The course texts ""really deserve their own class. Given the constraints of Harvard's curriculum, Russell did the right thing to shoehorn them in there,"" Pickett -aid. While Kiebdaj said she enjoys the class, she is not sure it should be required as it is at Columbia. ""If [Literature Humanities] becomes a re-quired class I would worry, because I can't see it being taught by anyone besides Professor Russell. There's a tendency to get very dry and mechanical, and his class isn't that way,"" Kiebdaj said. ""I don't know whether people have enough trust in the administration to say, ""When [Harvard] says that everyone should read Plato or Aristotle, Tm going to put my trust in their hands,""' Pickett said. 'Part ofme thinks that [Harvard] should forcefeed [Literature Humanities] to everyone,"" he added.Russell said he would like to see his class become a requirement but said it would likely not happen within his lifetime. He described the difference between the Harvard and Columbia versions of the class as the equivalent of ""going from a parish church to a cathedral,"" as Columbia's entire firstyear class takes Literature Humanities and his Harvard seminar is quite a bit smaller. Russell said he plans to offer the second half of Literature Humanities in the spring. Pickett said he is building his schedule around it"
401,"Open Notes, Open Book Cheating, Unauthorized Collaboration, and Academic Integrity",7 December 2005,"Cheating, Unauthorized Collaboration, and Academic IntegrityBy Tess Brustein and Kira Goldenberg Columbia Daily SpectatorAfter many incidents of cheating last year, Frontiers of Science added ""weekly individual assignments"" to take pressure off students and decrease opportunities for unauthorized collaboration. But, as with other large classes with regular problem sets, the ""individual"" nature of these assignments is often disregarded. ""I know some guy on my hall got an 87 and everyone else got a 100 because everyone copied each other,"" Joseph Matuk, CC 'O9, said. With reports of widespread cheating in two required introductory courses in the past two years, academic integrity has increasingly become an issue at Columbia. Though there have been no similar events this semester, academic integrity reentered public discourse recently when students in CC and SEAS were asked to fill out an online academic integrity survey, the thirddata collection in a 15-year study by Rutgers Professor Donald L. McCabe. Though the survey results are not yet available, administrative debate on how to best tamp down on cheating has picked up steam. More than most issues, academic integrity is divisive due to its subjective nature; it conjures questions of why cheating occurs at Columbia, how it should be dealt with, and how students, faculty, and administration should be involved in broaching the issue. Widespread Incidents During the first official year of Frontiers of Science in 2004-05, both semesters saw widespread and repeated cheating on the four large take-home assignments. According to Frontiers co-chair David Helfand, a sizeable group of students met to exchange answers on Carman 6 on Sunday nights before the monthly assign-ment was due. He said that he was troubled since the course was geared toward critical thinking. Helfand said that the cheating was discovered after a number of students got the same answers wrong. ""The other instructors and I sort of uncovered this ring—we e-mailed out suspicious answers and found that other students had the exact same answers,"" said science fellow Jennifer Blanck, an instructor of two Frontiers seminars. ""I've caught a lot of people cheating, and it's been heartbreaking."" As a result, the course's structure was changed. This year it incorporates new weekly assignments. Helfand said this change was intended to individualize assignments by seminar and to decrease pressure on students by making each item worth fewer points. But the problem persists. ""Cheating definitely goes on,"" Matuk said.""I do find it troubling. I think we have many more students who are here for a degree rather than an education,"" Helfand said. A similar incident occurred in fall 2003 in the SEAS required class, Gateway, which is structured similarly to Frontiers, with a 160-person lecture and smaller lab groups. A SEAS junior wishing to remain anonymous explained that many students panicked before the final assignment was due and exchanged answers. He said he agreed to show his answers to two fellow students with the understanding that they would look at his methods and then complete the assignment themselves. One of them, he said, copied it verbatim. ""When you're writing in code, you often put comments to explain what the code does,"" he said. The classmate copied not only the code but also the comments. He recalled the instructors announcing they had placed assignments in piles according to answers that appeared shared. ""We're not going to tell you who it is, you have to come and confess,"" he recalled them saying. Those who confessed were not referred to Associate Dean for Student Affairs Sandra Johnson's office. They were told that their names had been compiled and would be usedagainst them in the case of any future academic transgressions. Difficult Decisions Disciplinary procedures for academic honesty have long been a source of contention, particularly as there are no clear guidelines. According to Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis, the Committee on Instruction is currently working to draft a statement to clarify the faculty's stance on the importance of academic integrity. Despite this unified front, faculty members are divided on how the University should and does respond to cheating. Official Columbia policy lists disciplinary probation, suspension, and expulsion as ""possible outcomes"" for those students found guilty of cheating. Such punishments are meted out by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. But many incidents never make it there. The Frontiers students caught cheating underwent discipline through the dean's office. The Gateway participants did not. In fall 2003, five SEAS students were disciplined through the dean's office for academic dishonesty, according to Associate Dean for Student Affairs Sandra Johnson. However, according to a student involved in the incident,approximately half the Gateway lecture was guilty—about 80 students. Johnson said many instructors deal with problems individually, without sending the students to her office. Gareth Williams, acting chair of Literature Humanities, agreed. ""Individual instructors often have ways of quietly dealing with the problem,"" he said. Some faculty members believe that discipline should be handled through current administrative protocol, while others say the official process is too lenient to be effective. Helfand said the administration tends to view discipline as an educational opportunity without severe consequences, a position which he said is often ineffective. ""If there are no consequences, I'm not sure how effective the education is,"" he said. But in the eyes of some, even the current system serves as a strong deterrent. Montse Ferrer, CC 'O6, a student representative on the Committee on the Core, said the fear of ramification prevents many students from cheating. What Makes a Cheater? In addition to differences in opinion over disciplinary procedures, the definition of cheating is also a source of contention. In the view of the administration, there is littledifference between students working together on what is supposed to be an individual assignment, and looking over someone's shoulder during an exam. Still, many courses lack clear guidelines for outside work, and the distinction between collaboration and cheating is often difficult to define. ""It's a very thin line,"" said Robert Price, CC 'O9, who is currently enrolled in Frontiers. Ferrer noted that the unique opportunity for intellectual collaboration in Columbia's Core Curriculum may also act as a double-edged sword. Though the Core encourages students to work together, it also increases opportunities for cheating, she said. ""I'm not against students working together because science is collaborative,"" a Frontiers instructor, requesting anonymity, said. ""[But] at the end of the day, I want them to write it up themselves."" Still, students note that even when instructors clearly prohibit collaboration, it still occurs. Thus the line between collaboration and cheating disappears. But students agree that academic integrity is an integral part of the Columbia education. ""With the kids who are going here, they understand the quality of the student,"" Andrew Radosevich, SEAS 'O9, said. ""They're only hurting themselves if they cheat"""

Sure, I remember fake figure skating in my living room—my mom questioning why her son was attempting triple axles in sneakers, but nevertheless awarding me the gold medal and singing the black national anthem. Yeteven those memories leave much to be desired. At an average school like Columbia, I cannot believe that I am the only one feeling inadequate as the games approach. -0h yes, you probably know where this is going: 1 want to sponsor Columbia's very own Olympics, to be held right here in Morningside Heights (and no, I am not naming the Olympics after myself). The Columbia games will be more like the Special Olympics, except applying to the geeky kids who have no excuse not to be athletic. This is an opportunity to highlight all of our students' talents and bring everyone together. Since I am founding the games, I can make the events more amenable to the campus. Therefore, we have the opportunity to make the average Columbian into a star! The first event will feature SEAS males competing to hit on FIT girls. The males will gather in the West End and each will have two minutes to display their skills to the interesting and oh so attractive FIT lady population. SEAS males will be judged on their ability to match clothing colors, smell of breath, and lack of dandruff in their hair. The next event will take us across the street to Barnard, where the women will compete in a reading out loud competition. Students here will be judged on difficulty of syntax chosen, accuracy of word pronunciation, and ability to understand material, so no easy ones! Even GS will be included in the Columbia Olympics. GS students will compete to see who can best impersonate someone below 25. This may seem easy to our younger population, but you try having back spasms, wrinkles and still being able to rock a polo sweater, it's easier said than done. And of course, those CC kids, will not be spared from the action. Students enrolled in the College will test their skills of sifting through tire piles of rejection letters that pile up on their desks this time of year. History, English and Sociology majors will all compete to see how can get the most rejections from Corporate America. This event takes precision and strength to endure the numerous paper cuts and the subsequent starvation that begins during unemployment. The events will also include minorities trying to catch a cab, discount shopping at Morton Williams, and avoiding those representatives from Children International who just want a moment of your time to help the children, along with your credit card number. The one true sporting event will go to our President, who shall lead the school in a 5K ran. Indeed, it may take him and other participants three days and a car ride to finish the race, but Columbia will take whatever forms of athleticism it can get Yes, the Columbia Olympics will be glorious. We were going to have M. Diane Murphy carry the Olympic torch through College Walk, but she thought the flames posed as a fire hazard, and since Columbia has had so many problems with fires on College Walk in the past she decided to ban the torch policy. On a related note, the student council is now planning to boycott all torch ceremonies, including the lighting of the torch on the head of Alma Mater. The opening ceremony will take place in Riverside Park. Luckily, in Riverside, spectators will have all the excitement of experiencing the muggings that happen to Americans in foreign cities, assuring that nothing will be missed at the Columbia Olympics. Most importantly, the Columbia Olympics will bring the community closer in a way that only the games can do. Ifs okay that ours will be a sad comparison to the games of the Greek gods that we learned about in Literature Humanities, but what do you want from a school that prides itself on wine and cheese parties and cocktail conversations on Kant and Copeland? This winter, records will be broken, tears shed and SEAS boys embarrassed. Are you ready for the games? Kwame Spearman is a Columbia College senior majoring in history and political science.

405,SIPA Reforms Core Curriculum Reform Group that Lobbied For Changes Alleged that Curriculum Lacked Diversity,24 February 2006,"Reform Group that Lobbied For Changes Alleged that Curriculum Lacked DiversityBy Tom Faure Spectator Staff WriterAlleging that their core curriculum lacked diversity, a group of students at the School of International and Public Affairs began to lobby for change last Spring. After several months of discussions, the Curricular Reform Group, created to meet with administrators and revise the SIPA curriculum, has already seen changes, and members say more may be in store. According to Mario Chamorro, President of the MLA-SIPA Student Association (SIPASA), SIPA is split into two programs: the Master of International Affairs and the Master of Public Administration programs. Members of SIPASA said that some students felt that one of the International Affairs program's core classes, entitled Conceptual Foundations in International Politics, was, ""too Westernized.""' The course, an introduction to international affairs, covers relations between countriesas well as several theories on public policy by thinkers like John Rawls and Thomas Hobbes. ""The readings and professors were too Westernized,"" one SIPASA member said. SIPASA members also said that some had complained about the course's length. Like the College's Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization classes, before the current reforms, Conceptual Foundations spanned over two semesters. Now, it runs a single semester. Chamorro credited the administration and students for their involvement in the process. ""The administration was very receptive, and now I think the students are fairly happy,"" he said. Several credited the creation of the Curricular Reform Group and its success in attempting to diversify the core as exemplary of the high level of involvement of typical SIPA students. ""It's sort of indicative of a school of public policy,"" one member said. ""You see this all the time,"" agreedChamorro. ""For example, the recently created Micro-Finance Working Group was looking for courses in mi-cro-finance and, due to lobbying efforts, there are a couple now."" ""It's an ongoing process,"" Chamorro added. ""The world is changing."" According to Chamorro, SIPA has a very large student activity base, with around forty groups, despite the fact that attendance at the school lasts only two years. Chamarro also said that activism is not restricted to SIPA alone. ""There was a conference for the Latin American Student Association last week at the Business School ... we work with other graduate schools."" In light of the SIPA's Curricular Reform Group's recent successes and the ease with which they were achieved, some may wonder whether Columbia College could also reassess its curriculum and consider revamping the staples of its Core or changing course syllabi. ""This year especially Professor Kitcher [chair of Contemporary Civilization] has been speaking to groups of students,"" said Kathryn Yatrakis, Dean of Academic Affairs. ""We're concerned with how these (courses) are taught, what should be included, what should be taught, pedagogical techniques,"" Yatrakis, said, adding that diversity has been a particularly important issue this year. ""Every two years the syllabi are re-evaluated. I think we really have to look at the Major Cultures courses,"" she said. A change is looming for certain courses, she added.SIPA'S CORE CURRICULUM (MIA Program): • U6BOO Conceptual Foundations of International Politics (4 credits) • U4595/4596 International Economics or • U4600/4601 International Economic Analysis • One Course in Interstate Relations (3 credits) • Two Courses in Regional Context (6 credits) • One Course in International Policy Analysis and Management • One Course in Statistics and Quantitative Analysis • One Course in Professional Development (1 credit) • One Internship (3-6 credits) • Foreign Language Proficiency"
406,Chris Shrugged Chris Kulawik Our Core Values,1 March 2006,"Our Core Values""¥"" Tniversity I President Lee V_/ C. Bollinger the Core Curriculum is not the University of Michigan. A ""barrage of multiculturalism"" and sham diversity cannot improve Western civilization. Yet, as we speak, committees and pundits alike push ahead in their attempts to ""diversify"" the Core. More often than not their warped thinking holds that any canon composed of ""dead white men"" is as irrelevant as it is illegitimate. True to their progressive moniker, they seek constant destabilizing change in a curriculum designed to represent an institution some 4,000 years old. In the late 1980s, the brilliant and lucid de Bary Report concerned with the ""haphazard or arbitrary insertion of non-Western material"" affirmed ""the primary focus on Western civilization."" The Standing Committee on the Core, a product of this report, according to Columbia scholar Timothy Cross, established the ""Extended Core,"" better known today as the Major Cultures requirement Although the expectation to learn about another civilization before graduation is quite reasonable, it was not enough for progressive voices; it never is. While some criticized white students for selecting certain cultures over others, still more championed smaller classes to mirror the older Core classes. Apparently, personal choice and economic considerations don't matter much. Mandatory classes of intimate sizes place a burden on already limited resources: space and teachers with specialization. With little success on these fronts, progressives quickly realized the most efficient way to counter ""misogynist"" ""Eurocentric,"" and 'White Civ,"" as it has been called, was to transform the most fundamental classes themselves: Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization.Change came in 1987 with the addition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Considering that women first entered Columbia in 1984, it's no surprise that the curriculum changed only three years later. Here, however, the issue is not whether the text should be considered part of Western civilization, for Austen is one of many European authors. Rather, we must ask, ""What was the impetus behind the addition?"" The answer is clear diversity. Does this mean, however, that the text isn't worthy of study? No. Personally, I believe it would make a fine text for a more specialized English literature class. What, then, is the problem? The goal of Lit Hum and CC is to introduce the student to those magnificent texts representative of history's greatest intellects—more specifically, those who had a role in shaping our world. We know this as the Western Canon. Those revolutionary texts, however, span a great epoch that begins with Homer and stretches up to today. This leaves professors and curriculum designers a mere four semesters to provide students with a sound historical grounding. Thus, the great conflict with these new ""additions"" is not the worth or the value of the text—although that may be debated—but what we must sacrifice in return. Since Austen, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Virginia Woolf were added, the list keeps expanding. To make room for a new text, or in this case, texts, classics must either be dropped, shortened, or combined. Take, for example, The Federalist Papers. Putting aside the simple fact that two of the three authors were Columbians, only one, Federalist 10, has lasted until today. To further denigrate the classic texts of American history, Federalist 10 is clumped together with the Constitution and Bill of Rights (note that the Declaration of Independence is conspicuously absent) as part of a ""Revolution Day."" These formative texts are essentially allotted the same amount of time for discussion and study as Thomas Jefferson's and Frederick Douglass' notes on slavery, as well as declarations from the French Revolution and theHaitian Constitution. Worse, only 15 years ago, Sigmund Freud marked the chronological end of CC. Today, the selections spiral further into the 20th century, up to the 1980s with Catharine MacKinnon's Toward a Feminist Theory of the State. These latest texts mark an era of radicalism and progressive doctrine, including, but not limited to, Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth. In response, we're told that the Core is topical, not simply a survey of the Western culture. CC presents the inclusion of such points of view as a ""response"" to a historical dialogue. If we buy this argument, and a case may be made for it we're forced to conclude that the curriculum is biased toward a certain ideology. If feminist and black scholars criticize the faulty thinking of Aristotle or Jefferson and get included in the curriculum, why is there no text from this modern era critical of Karl Marx or secular progressivism? Why no Friedrich Hayek? Why no Ayn Rand (a woman, no less)? What of William James' classic, Varieties of Religious Experience? It would seem that these advocates for ""change"" seek nothing more than a canonical affirmative action program. Not only have their latest picks been motivated by such overt considerations as gender and race (I'll neglect the ideological bent), but there is no talk of opening the Canon to excluded authors (read: dead white men) of the past Boethius, Erasmus, Thomas More, Thomas Paine, and Carl von Clausewitz come to mind. The same critique applies to Lit Hum: why read Woolf as an example of stream of consciousness, but not William Faulkner? All of these authors are talented—thafs a given—but should race and gender really play a role in deciding Columbia's Canon? Contemporary whims are slowly eroding the foundations of our history. Somewhere, Jacques Barzun is crying. Chris Kulawik is a Columbia College sophomore. Chris Shrugged runs alternate Wednesdays."

408,"Existential Movement Debuts on Campus Life Attendees of 'The Breaking' Event Skeptical, Intrigued",4 April 2006,"Attendees of 'The Breaking' Event Skeptical, IntriguedBy Sadia Latifi Spectator Staff Writer""We want to diverge as a new species,"" Dean Lukic tells the curious audience in the packed Wood Auditorium of Avery Hall Thursday night. There is muffled laughter. The Center for Broken Thought held its inaugural event last week, ""Chaos, Delirium, and the Phantom Territories,"" marking the initiation of a new existential movement in the city. The Center, founded by Lukic, a Columbia Ph.D candidate, and Jason Mohaghegh, a visiting professor at Columbia, is a nonprofit organization that intends to offer seminars, host performances, and publish works. ""The Breaking"" is the focal point for the Center. This movement, according to Mohaghegh, aims to revitalize and reawaken creative expression with the immediacy that once characterized manifestos and movements. At the event, the founders neglected to discuss operations of the center and instead focused on elements of the movement, which adopts a disjointed state of experience and blurs the line between the self and the world inspired by thinkers like Nietzsche, Bataille, Artaud, and Shamu. The elements of the movement include cruelty, threat, irradiation, rage, abduction, abandonment, and illusion. ""We are liars, great liars, and storytellers as is every great writer, as is every great thinker ... we take the world as an illusion,"" Mohaghegh said. Reaction from the audience was generally skeptical. ""I didn't understand what they were trying to get at,"" said Eva Carpenter, CC 'O9. ""1 am not sure what it's about. 1 saw it as really pretentious, and I think the whole thing was slightly ridiculous."" Mohaghegh himself admitted that the movement was ""slightly elitist,"" adding that members are generally easy to spot. ""You can see it in their eyes,"" he said. ""Not all have the taste or the thirst to want topush themselves to these outer banks. Many are very content with their constrained sense of reality. For those who like to trespass, for those who like to infiltrate, we look to form new alliances."" Despite their deliberately elusive nature, Mohaghegh insisted that the concepts of their movement are no abstractions. ""Ideas, if they are orchestrated correctly, are already actions. They are already currents, they are already impulses,"" he said. ""These concepts are ... palpable and they inform existence at every level. They are not withdrawn, they're not escapist, they're not forms of fantasia or speculation. More than anything, we're concerned with speed and force. And that permits no luxury of abstraction."" Mohaghegh, known for his philosophical and sometimes bizarre teaching methods, invited his students to attend. ""It's basically a group of concepts. It's not a psychological or social or artistic experience so much as it is an existential movement. I'm anxious to see what it provides,"" Ryan Cornell, SEAS 'OB and one of Mohaghegh's Literature Humanities students, said. ""It looks like a lot of people were uneasy sitting at the event. They felt what they had witnessed didn't live up to expectations,"" Eliseo Santos, CC 'O9 and another of Mohaghegh's Lit Hum students, said. Many audience members left early and said they felt the event was absurd, some using the word ""cult-like."" ""We are oblivious and indifferent to those who can't find themselves somewhere within this. We provide such a multiplicity of existential possibilities,"" Mohaghegh said. ""The ones who come and say this has nothing to offer me ... for us, they are condemned, they are lost."" He adding that he welcomed challenges to his group's beliefs through active engagement and dialogue. ""Critique is always the act of imposing limitations, which is why we reject it.""The Center for Broken Thought's next event Is: ""The New Weapon: Ecstasy and Threat, Coldness and Whisper"" - April 15, 7:30 p.m., White Box.

409,"Former Czech Leader Joins CU, Core Havel to Visit Columbia for Ten Weeks",6 September 2006,"Havel to Visit Columbia for Ten WeeksBY AMANDA ERICKSON Spectator Senior Staff WriterLook out, Aristotle, and move over, Homer. There's a new name on the Core reading list. Starting in mid-October, Vaclav Havel — famed writer, human rights activist, and first president of the Czech Republic—will be visiting Columbia for 10 weeks.In honor of his visit, some of his work will be integrated into two major Core classes. One of Havel's plays, The Garden Party, will be taught as a required part of the Literature Humanities curriculum. He will also deliver the annual Contemporary Civilization lecture to sophomores this fall. Havel is visiting Columbia as part of the Artist-in-Residence program, started lastyear by Gregory Mosher, director of the University Arts Initiative. Last year, the role was filled by dramatist Peter Brook, who directed Tierno Bokar at Barnard College. The former Czech leaderwill not teach classes during his stay, but he is expected to work with students and professors in several Columbia schools, delivering talks, and speaking informally with students. Born in Prague in 1936, Havel began writing in the early 19605. He rose to become one of the leading opponents of Communism in Czechoslovakia, helping to run a bloodless overthrow of the Russians. His works include The Garden Party, The Memorandum, Conspirators, and The Beggars Opera.HAVEL"
410,"Smit, 75, Was Only Prof to Teach Four Main Core Classes Decorated Historian Joined CU Faculty in 1965",15 September 2006,"Decorated Historian Joined CU Faculty in 1965BY AMANDA ERICKSON Spectator Senior Staff WriterProfessor J. W. Smit, a Renaissance historian and the only person to teach all four Core Curriculum classes, died of heart failure in July. He was 75. Smit began his career at Columbia in 1965, when he was appointed as the Queen Wilhelmina professor of history. But 40 years, three awards, and eight years as Contempo-rary Civilization chair show Smit's biggest contribution to the University: his support of Columbia's bedrock curriculum. ""He was a great believer in the Core,"" said James Mirollo, Parr professor emeritusof English and comparative literature, who served as chair of Literature Humanities while Smit was chair of CC. ""He was worried about it. He thought it wasn't going to hold up."" He had reason to be nervous. After the protests of the 19605, the Core was ""in shambles,"" according to Professor Michael Rosenthal, who was the associate dean of the English department at the time. Though Smit had no prior experience teaching CC, he was chosen to help redevelop its curriculum in 1972. ""It is most unusual to have a left-wing European national interested in something as peculiar as the Core Curriculum,"" Rosenthal said. ""But he became the embodiment of the Core."" Smit went on to teach CC, Lit Hum, MusicHum, and Art Hum—the only professor ever to have done so. He also served as chair of the CC program from 1978 to 1982 and again from 1989 to 1992. He was a member of the Columbia College Commission on the Core during the 1988-'B9 school year and became the first chairman of the standing committee on the Core in 1990. His interests were wide and varied. He earned his undergraduate degree and doctorate from the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, specializing in 17th and 18th centuryDutch history. He was also a distinguished piano player, dancer, and cook, according to Mark L. Von Hagen, Boris Bakhmeteff professor of Russian and East European studies and chair of the history department. Though Smit was officially retired from Columbia, he continued to teach Core classes. He had planned to teach Nobility and Civility this semester. ""Teaching was his piece de resistance,"" Mirollo said. ""He knew everything about everything."" There will be a memorial service in his honor on Monday, Sept. 18, at 5 p.m. in St. Paul's Chapel.I MEMORIAL SERVICE Monday, Sept. 18, 5 p.m. St. Paul's Chapel"
411,Artists on Campus,15 September 2006,"This October, thanks to the Columbia University Arts Initiative, Columbia will welcome Vaclav Havel to campus as an artist in residence. His time here ought to be an exciting one for the University, and especially for undergraduate students who normally would not have an opportunity to meet or interact with someone of his caliber. Havel was the President of Czechoslovakia and, later, of the Czech Republic. He is famous both for his role in the peaceful overthrow of communism in his country as well as for his work as an essayist and playwright. Unfortunately, Columbia administrators and faculty have taken his visit one step too far in putting his play, The Garden Party , on the Literature Humanities syllabus. To its credit, CUArts has already made numerous efforts to ensure that undergraduate students have the opportunity to meet, interact with, and learn from Havel. All students will be given the chance to watch his plays—all of which are being performed in New York in honor of his visit, including one, The Beggar's Opera, at Columbia. CUArts recently sponsored a focus group to discuss the types of events students would like to see Havel participate in. He is also scheduled to give the Contemporary Civilization lecture this fall. But placing Havel's play, The Garden Party, on the Lit Hum syllabus makes little sense. For betteror for worse, Lit Hum is designed to be a series of selected literary works and Western masterpieces presented chronologically. Regardless of its literary merit, Havel's work does not belong alongside the Greek classics. While demanding that first-years read The Garden Party will undoubtedly familiarize students with Havel's work, it will not make his stay at Columbia any more special for them. Furthermore, by voting to add The Garden Party to the Fall Lit Hum syllabus, the Literature Humanities Curriculum Review Committee made it seem like they were simply rewarding Havel for coming to Columbia. Intentional or not, the decision sets a poor precedent for future artists in residence—come to Columbia and we'll add one of your works to the Core syllabus, regardless of its relevance. The Core is arguably Columbia's strongest asset; its curriculum should not be tampered with lightly. All in all, Havel's visit is something everyone at Columbia hopefully looks forward to and will benefit from. His mere presence speaks highly for the University. And if CUArts implements some of the focus group's ideas, Havel's residency promises to be an unmatched success. But the University will only make the most of his visit if it does not treat his presence on the Lit Hum syllabus as a substitute for actual student interactions."
412,RETROSPECTIVE CU Took Tentative Steps Toward Coeducation,19 September 2006,"CU Took Tentative Steps Toward CoeducationBy Todd BressiSept. 22, 1981 ""Faculty Disappointed by Details of Coed Talks""Disappointed with the tentative coeducation arrangements President Sovern outlined at the Senate meeting Friday, several university professors said they had been hoping for an accord closer to merger in several areas. Most of the professors continued to say that they thought the best way to improve the College's declining applicant pool, a problem often ascribed to the school's lack of coeducation, would be for the College to admit women. Sovern said Friday that Columbia and Barnard had reached ""agreements in principle"" to make the dining halls and dormitories more coeducational,and Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization required courses for Barnard students. ""It worries me if this is all there is,"" said James Mirollo, professor of English and comparative literature. Peter Pouncey, associate professor of Greek and Latin and former dean of the College, said he was not sure any negotiated settlement could be sufficiently raise the level of the applicant pool. 'Twelve years of negotiations have produced nothing but fudge,"" he said. ""Clever though the president may be, he may not be the extra dimension needed.""1981"
413,Overachiever And the Winner Is...,28 September 2006,"By Paul BarndtThe Core gurus will soon be meeting to determine the winner of this year's Wallace A. Gray Prize, awarded to the ""Columbia College undergraduate who is judged by the faculty to have written the best essay in Literature Humanities."" In addition to bragging rights, the winner will receive a seat at the Academic Awards ceremony in Low Library, not to mention a pretty decent check for his or her hard efforts. Last fall, the winner was Sarah MacNeill, CC 'O9 (formerly '08), who captured victory with ""Battle of the Sexes: MTV's Lost Season in 14th Century Italy"" or ""Decameron s Reality Bites."" The title may be misleading, as the paper itself is actually a thoughtful analysis of shifting gender roles and behavioral restrictions on women in Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron. Nevertheless, it does show her interest in popular culture, not so surprising considering her decision to take some time off to spend a year in Los Angeles working in the film industry. ""It is always a little off the beaten path to take a year off, but I wanted to feel really confident about what I was doing with my life before I finished college,and I needed to live it, to see if I could do it. School is a vehicle to find out what I'm doing with my life, and I wanted a clear picture of what I was doing with my education,"" MacNeill said. Even though it was only during this summer that she made her decision to spend the year in Los Angeles, she has already worked on various interesting projects, including an internship at New Line Studios. Currently, she is taking a cinematography class and devoting plenty of time to writing and working on a story with her aunt. ""You throw all your cards out and hope one sticks. LA is tough; there are a lot of disappointments,"" she admits. Winning the prize, however, has contributed to MacNeill's willingness to pursue some ambitious projects. Academically, Sarah thinks that it ""encouraged [her] to major in film studies and English."" Most of all, she feels more confident in her writing abilities, which has helped her realize that she ""really want[s] to do writing over, say, corporate development."" One of MacNeill's favorite books from which to draw guidance is Julie Cameron's The Artist's Way, which offers advice about how to overcome personal creative blocks. ""It helps organize your thoughts after you vomit [them] on paper,"" she said. One of Cameron's must's is to write a few pages every morning about anything in order to make writing a habitual act. In following that advice, Sarah sets aside time every morning for journaling and keeps a pen and paper on hand at all times. In the afternoons, you will most likely catch her scribbling away at one of the many ""great little cafes"" in LA. When she's not writing, Sarah also enjoys going to music shows, taking advantage of the new and upcoming talent that flocks to the Los Angeles music industry. Sarah is ""definitely"" returning to Columbia next fall, excited to engage in more of that ""debating and discussing literature"" that was integral to her rewarding Lit Hum experience. But don't think this West Coast-sawy awardwinner will be showing off in front of the whole class. ""I'm not that person who's holding [her] hand up constantly."""
414,THEATER Amateurs Take a Bow At SLAM,24 October 2006,
415,PACK YOUR BAGGAGE ETHAN PACK Searching for Judaism in The Core,27 October 2006,"Searching for Judaism in The CoreAround here, it's really hard to be a complaining Jew. Coming from the Midwest, I am used to being able to talk about the marginalization of my Jewish heritage and at least get a moment of interest—or indifference. But, in a city with 15 percent of the world's Jews, and in a neighborhood where a prominent cross street is named Isaac Bashevis Singer Boulevard, I have become used to something unimaginable: familiarity. It seemed like only yesterday I was playing Little League with kids who thought that I had horns under my cap and that I killed God before batting practice. Today, I'm surrounded by Jews and Judaism. But despite (or perhaps because of) all the Seinfeld, bagels, mispronounced holidays, and very visible observances, I would argue that Judaism still suffers a peculiar exclusion from our education at Columbia. Judaism here is something so pervasive, ironically, that it gets conflated into other areas of our studies without any consideration on its own terms. This occurred to me when I was taking Contemporary Civilization and fulfilling my Major Cultures requirement The treatment of the Old Testament by Literature Humanities and CC was nowhere near an accurate introduction to Judaism. Nor, one could argue, is CC's acrobatic inclusion of the Quran a successful primer on Islam. But while one can take Islamic Civilization or Introduction to Major Topics in the Middle East and South Asia for the Major Cultures requirement a Christian (mis) translation and exasperated graduates of Jewish day school are all the exposure Judaism gets in the Core. The problem begins with the text itself. As is true of any text the mere act of translation is itself an interpretation. The literary texture of the Torah's 4,000-year-old Hebrew is so remarkably different from English that any translation should require a thorough process of scholarly contextualization, as the Quran receives in Islamic Civ. But the situation is even more distorted with the Torah because the translation we use is a Christian compilation, based mostly on the King James Bible. While the King James version is an incredible work, its prerogatives as a translation were decidedly those of Christianity. This is clear enough from the name Old Testament in the Core Curriculum's edition of the Bible. From Judaism's perspective, there is nothing old about the Torah—it has no successor in its role as a testament /•« . J' "" The very translation of passages differs when they are taken to be portents of the coming of Jesus Christ as opposed to their reception in the original HebrewJewish milieu. (A great scene in the movie Snatch has Benicio Del Toro talking about the use of the word virgin for the Hebrew young woman in the early chapters of Isaiah.) At some point in Lit Hum or CC, pushy stereotypeconfirming people like me stopped clearing our sinuses long enough to make this point But this too is insufficient from an academic perspective. Overeducated students on a topic are no replacement for the option of a focused treatment by the Core. It is quite problematic to use a Christian version of this text while presenting it as the mouthpiece for Judaism in Western civilization. Reading Judaism through the Christian world view is like having Pilgrims on the Mayflower teach about the value of American Indian cultural practices. Distortions are implicit when one entity's existence is theologically predicated on replacing another's. This leads to false constructions, the grossest of which is the so-called Judeo-Christian tradition. An illustrative example: in the New Testament, much is made of the distinction between the Law of the Jews and the Love in the acceptance of Jesus as the Lord. This, too, is based on a mistranslation that yields Law for Torah, the literal translation of which is teaching. The supposed Jewish preoccupation with Law, to the exclusion of Love, is also misleading. Few realize that when Jesus says to 'love your neighbor as yourself in Matthew, he is quoting a commandment in Leviticus —the Torah's most doctrinaire book. An unexplored Judaism is wrongly associated with concepts like heaven and hell, Original Sin, and even certain characterizations of God—none of which appear in our religion's reading of itself. Erroneous dichotomies emerge between ""the jealous and violent God of the Old Testament"" and the ""loving God of the New Testament"" The Judaism described in the New Testament is intentionally reductive. This persists through the successor texts of the Christian West encountered in lit Hum and CC. They are silent toward the vast canon of Jewish literature without which the biblical text itself is empty from a Jewish perspective. The traditions of interpretation, legend, liturgy, civil law, and Kabbalistic mysticism that began with the Mishnah and Talmud yield a religion that could not be further from a cursory reading of the Old Testament in English. From an academic perspective, the Jewish religion is enticing for the sheer multidimensional scope of its texts. Influential modern literary critics like Walter Benjamin and Jacques Derrida are its direct descendants. And the questioning and revolutionary strains of this tradition are evident in some of the 20th century's secular Jewish geniuses: surrealists Andre Breton and Max Ernst Freud, Einstein, Martin Buber, and Hannah Arendt With the Major Cultures requirement Columbia declared that the Christian West's perspective is insufficient to describe the cultures that remained on its periphery. It failed to recognize that Judaism was swallowed, whole and mute, by the old equation and is excluded from the new one.

416,Gay Directing—Still Legal Nationwide The MIX NYC Annual Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival is back,9 November 2006,"The MIX NYC Annual Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival is backBy Scott EvansThe MIX NYC: Lesbian & Gay Experimental Film Festival is open once again, and this time it is taking over Lower Manhattan. In its 19th year, the festival is talcing place at the 3LD Art & Technology Center. Securing a ""sleek, Kubrickian space,"" as the festival program calls the building, is just the cap on a productive year. With sponsorship from such mainstream brands as Kodak and Tekserve, the festival seems to be coming into fruition as something more than ""that other queer film festival."" And what exactly can one expect from this unique event? According to Steven Kent Jusick, who took over as executive director this year: ""MIX is an artistrun festival, and it concentrates on short films and experimental or avant-garde films, as well as installation art. We like innovation and history, so we have shown digital work—as early as 1994 —while still championing formats like Super Bor films trips."" As for the crowd, ""MIX attracts a young crowd, an art crowd, and a sexy crowd,"" Jusick said. ""But we're also serious about authentic voices of queer artists, more so than escapist, feel-good movies. Some of MlX's work is rigorous and tough."" With big-budget franchise installments elbowing their way into the more mainstream New York film festivals lately, his dig does not go unnoticed. As for the films that MIX plays, one can simply look at the line-up for the festival for a glimpse of the abnormalities inherent in an experimental film festival. Most of the entries are 10 minutes or less, and many are abstract to the point where mass appeal becomes unfathomable. For MIX fans, though, the appeal is in individual subjection. The groups of (sometimes very) short films have been grouped thematically by night (e.g., Genderflux, Backalley Jukebox, Beautiful Decay), and tickets are sold accordingly (most nights last a few hours and cost $10). Also differentiating MIX from Tribeca Film Festival is its organizers' choice to keep the event more or less in one location, rather than spread throughout Manhattan. The specific theme and narrowed audiences, it seems, are at the root of this decision. ""MIX is better when it's focused, not entropic,"" Jusick opines. ""We don't have the staff to have too many venues up and running at once. In 1996 we had venues in the East Village, Tribeca, and Harlem, but it was very hard, and it split our audience a lot."" There are a few ways that the MIX board is attempting to spread the experimental queer film movement throughout New York City, though. Jusick says: ""One way that we do de-center ourselves is by doing free community screenings in the winter and spring. Last year we had screenings in Park Slope, East Harlem, the Bronx, and in other places, in an effort to bring the films to the people, rather than making them come to us all the time.""But which films should you check out? As the perfect complement to your Literature Humanities course, be sure to see a new, queer interpretation of Homers epic The Odyssey. The film is a col-laboration between 32 queer and transsexual filmmakers, and it will close the festivities as the centerpiece of a wild night celebrating the classic work. The price of admission covers food and drinks, aswell as live music, readings from the text, and performances. While the film will be screening on Sunday night, it is part of a larger project. The Odyssey project is, according to the festival guide, a collaboration between writer Andrea Lawlor and filmmaker Bernadine Mellis that: ""comprises a book and an accompanying film on DVD. The book functions as a dramatis personae of the film, with each character represented by stories, poetry, or visual art by cutting-edge writers and artists working in and between multiple genres. The film consists of 24 contiguous shorts (in media ranging from stop-motion animation to live action, from abstract video art to found footage) telling the complete story of Homers 24-char-acter epic."" The first 24 people to arrive will receive giveaways of the package, so come early and secure a seat at what is bound to be an interesting version of one of your favorite classic texts. Also of note is MIX NYC s recendy initiated queer youth media training program, A Different Take. This program affords lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth a sense of empowerment in the form of artistic self-expression. With help from volunteers from MIX and other successful public programs, such as REACH LA, queer youth are given video cameras and encouraged to tell their respective stories. The results break down social barriers and give voice to those who are often unheard. The diverse line-up of shorts includes: Inside Out, a lesbian teen's confessional of life on the streets and in shelters Cruzando la Frontera, a passionate poetic take on crossing the U.S. border Love is Shit, a young trans-female's lament for longed-for love in the West Village I'm Gonna Die a Virgin, chronicling the yearning for love and the constant fear of dying young and alone Boy Wonder, a young man's struggle in a double life as a straight family man by day and transvestite prostitute by night Billy Batch's Rockin' Rampage, a spoof of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood that deals with dating issues in the lesbian youth community My Crazy Life, an animated short that playfully portrays the realities of a young gay Latino male living in South Central Los Angeles Green Room, a visual autobiography that uses archival footage to offer unique insight into the life of a modern queer teen Any true cinephile, regardless of sexual orientation, should take this unique opportunity to see these small wonders.FILM INFORMATION A DIFFERENT TAKE: QUEER YOUTH SPEAK OUT FRIDAY NOV. 10, 7 P.M.

417,"CAMPUS In Honor of His Residency, the University Brings Havel's Beggar to Life at Miller Theater",5 December 2006,"In Honor of His Residency, the University Brings Havel's Beggar to Life at Miller TheaterBY JAKE GREEN Columbia Daily SpectatorAnyone not living under a rock at the bottom of Butler Stacks knows about Vaclav Havel's residence at Columbia But few actually know who this Havel character is, and fewer still have read anything by the gentleman. Luckily, the Core Curriculum Office has remedied this tragedy by including Havel's The Garden Party in the Literature Humanities syllabus, and making him keynote speaker of the Contemporary Civilization Coursewide Lecture. If this weren't enough of the pre-eminent Czech statesman/playwright for us to handle, The Harriman Institute, the Slavic and Theatre Departments of Barnard College, and Columbia University presented a production of Havel's adaptation of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera this weekend in the spacious Miller Theater. The play itself departs from Havel's Theater of the Absurd antics, due in equal parts to the source material —a whimsical Augustan Age ballad opera —and the backdrop of Soviet oppression when Havel was writing. After the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, Havel was banned from the theater. Instead of quietly acquiescing to the regime (like a good little Communist), Havel decided to rewrite Gay's Beggar's Opera as a protest piece and pass it off as the original. Whether or not the show's political message alone makes it worthy of revival, Havel's attraction to Gay is easy enough to understand. Like Havel, Gay buried high ideals and political satirebeneath burlesque and bawdy humor. But whereas Gay's Beggar's Opera was light-hearted and, well, gay, Havel's adaptation, at least in this production, is ardent and sententious. In order to draw attention to this sobriety, Havel decided to remove the defining characteristic of an opera; music (though Brooklyn-based band Chica Libre added an ambient underscore). Luckily, we got puppets. For this production, directors Amy Trompetter and Sergei Zemstov of the Moscow Art Theatre created a cartoonish landscape of floating buildings, furniture, and people (deftly animated by a team of black-clad puppeteers) that dramatized and mimicked the action on stage, the well-known story of Macheath, a sophisticated brigand caught up in the squalor of Victorian London. When Macheath proposes to Polly Peachum (Meredith Hill, BC '07), her father (Yavni BarYam, CC '09), a con man in cahoots with the local police chief, devises a scheme to take over Macheath's lucrative criminal organization, which lands Macheath in jail again and again. As a critique of Communist corruption, the puppets'pantomime effectively communicated the message that whether we like it or not, we are all controlled by outside forces. But while visually appealing (imagine a giant pop-up picture book), the puppets did not make up for the confusion that resulted from ""radical cuts"" and uneven acting among the cast (which was beautifully costumed by Kara Feely and Laura Morris). Due to the hybrid nature of the play, there were incongruities among the actor's choices.Half the cast opted for tight caricatures, in line with Gay's original work For instance, Sara Fay Goldman, BC 'O7, Lauren Feinberg, BC 'O7, and Sarah Hartmann, BC 'O9, each had wonderful comic turns as a ditzy Madame and two of her whores. Samantha Rose Schwab, BC 'O9, was unimpeachable as Mr. Peachum's uppity wife, as was the always dependable Bess Miller, BC 'OB, as the evil police chief s croaky-voiced old lady. The other half sided with the more tragic tenor of Havel's adaptation, which provides an ambivalent coda to Macheath's final release from jail. Caitlin Harrity, BC 'O7, maintained a captivating presence as Lucy, one of Maeheath's many conquests, as did Natasha Warner, BC 'O7, as doe-eyed, but dangerous, seductress Jenny. Markjunek CC 'O7, who produced dynamic performances last year in Assassins and the 112 th Varsity Show, was uncharacteristically restrained and brooding as the noble highwayman and womanizer Macheath, though he unleashed some bravado during his final, poignant monologue, in which he accepts his fate as a pawn of the state. In all, the show was entertaining, but suffered from too much concept and too little execution. The show's climactic scene, the corrupt chief of police (Mark Rosenthal, GS 'O7) and his wife (Miller) stand amidst the puppets of all characters in the play, now in silhouette. The image portrayed the scope of the city's corruption (they're all puppets of the government get if), but it also demonstrated how the performers were upstaged by the staging itself. One hears of actors chewing scenery, but seldom does the scenery chew up the actors.THE BEGGAR'S OPERA AT MILLER THEATER | Actors Sara Fay Golman BC'O7, Andrew Sotomayor, CC, senior visiting student, and Lauren Feinberg, BC'O7, pay homage to University visitor and renowned playwrite Vaclav Havel in a production of The Beggar's Opera, his political rewrite of John Gay's originally comic script of the same name."
418,CAMPUS Hips Don't Lie: Belly Dancers Shake CU,31 January 2007,"Hips Don't Lie: Belly Dancers Shake CUBY KATIE LOGAN Columbia Daily SpectatorShimmying and hip-snapping have swept Columbia —you can see it in elevators, lounges, and even the stale rooms of Butler. This new trend is not an accident but rather the handiwork of a single student, Sara Arias, CC 'OB. Arias, a professional belly dancer, has been performing since she was 11, dancing in her,..aunt's restaurants and at private parties. Two years ago, she began teaching classes every week for dancers of all levels. Several of the once-amateur girls she taught now make up her own belly-dancing troupe. Though not recognized as a Columbia group, Arias' troupe is making an impact, performing in multi-cultural events from Barnard College to Teachers' College. And on any given Monday night, Arias can be found teaching a handful of her eager students. ""There's all different body types,"" Arias said of her students. ""It [belly dancing] is a very female dance. It brings out the beauty in all of them."" One of those students is Vera Tseylikman, CC 'OB. Tseylikman met Arias in literature humanities during her first year at Columbia and very quickly became one of her first students. The two are now the co-presidents of the increasingly popular troupe—Arias is the choreographer and trainer, while Tseylikman handles event scheduling. The troupe's other four dancers also began by taking classes with Arias before becoming members of the team.Tseylikman danced samba in high school but had no belly-dancing experience until she started learning from Arias. ""It was quite a challenge,"" she said. ""Samba and belly dance are very different. You use different muscles."" Arias said that one legend in the Middle East describes the origins of belly dancing as a method that helped women prepare for childbirth by stressing their abdominals. Belly dancing, then, is a fertility dance —a celebration of sensuality rather than- thd erotic gyrations suggested by negative' Stereotypes. : iu ""It's an art form. It's not something that should be seen as vulgar,"" Arias said. ""It's mostly bringing out the joy of being female."" ""And embracing the culture,"" added Tseylikman. While belly dancing is rooted in Arab heritage, the dance team mixes the Middle Eastern tradition with its own diverse backgrounds, from Ethiopian to Russian. Arias has used tribal, Latin, Indian, Turkish, and Moroccan influences in her choreography. ""We all put in a different style to the dance team, which 1 love,"" she said. ""Do your own stuff, and we integrate it into the group."" The dancers noted that even their audiences add to a feeling of diversity. They have received support from several Jewish organizations. The troupe first performed for the opening of Cafe Nana in the Kraft Center and has subsequently danced at events for the Hillel. It has also performed at Barnard's Culture Shock. The group faces a challenge performing at some University-sponsored events because ithas yet to gain recognition as a University club, but this obstacle'hasn't slowed down the team's co-presidents. The girls plan to reapply for recognition this year to ensure that the club will last after they graduate. They also have big plans for the future, which include more performances and cc meeting with belly-dancing groups at other universities. In the meantime, their classes continue to grow. Arias estimated that she has somewhere between 30 and 40 students. The group's unrecognized status means that they have to get creative with practice space. The lessons began in the basement of Carman and drew more than just dancers. ""We had an audience at the window,"" Arias said. ""We had way too many spectators."" Lessons now take place in the basement of River, where Arias lives. This semester's classes continue this week and take place every Monday from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. Information is available on the team's Facebook group, Bellydancers. ""We want to say we left a legacy here at Columbia,"" Arias said. With rising attendance at classes and future performances in the works, look to see that legacy—in the form of snake arms and hip circles —making its mark in all sorts of unexpected places.

419,Barnard Appoints New First-Year Dean Hollibaugh Moves Up From English Department to Replace Outgoing Dean Hilary Link,8 February 2007,"Hollibaugh Moves Up From English Department to Replace Outgoing Dean Hilary LinkBY HAYLEY NEGRIN Spectator Staff WriterLisa Hollibaugh of the Barnard English Department will be instated as Barnard's new first-year dean on March 5, 2007, officials announced yesterday. The search for a replacement began in October when former first-year dean Hilary Link was hired as the dean for study abroad, leaving an open post in the Dean of Studies Office. Hollibaugh willtake over the position as Barnard enters a dynamic period in its history with the impending construction of the Nexus building. ""One of my goals is to keep emphasizing and finding more and more ways to build a sense of Barnard community, especially since the campus is going to be changing over the next couple of years,"" Hollibaugh said. ""It's very important to keep people involved on campus with each other.""""Everyone was impressed with her warmth and her ability to make connections with people.... People talked about how she could be really funny and insightful,"" said Karen Blank, dean of studies and coordinator of the committee. The committee narrowed the competition down to three finalists who were brought to campus for interviews by various Barnard faculty and administrators, including Dean Dorothy Denburg, every dean in the Dean of Studies Office, Deanof Admissions Jennifer Fondiller, and Director of the Office of Disability Services Susan Quinby. There was also a panel of eight students involved in the interview process from diverse positions and backgrounds within the Barnard community. ""I was just so struck at the end of my day of interviews,"" Hollibaugh said. ""I was really pleased to see how friendly and enthusiastic ... everyone I met was.Meeting so many new people just reinforced my positive view of Barnard. I'm really excited to be taking up this role."" Hollibaugh is currently teaching the first-year seminar course ""The Legacy of the Mediterranean"" part-time at Barnard as well as working at the law firm Mayer, Brown, Rowe, and Maw, where she has been an administrator for over 13 years. ""My time working in my law firm has given me a great sense of organization,and I really like the idea that I will have so many different kinds of duties and tasks in the dean position,"" Hollibaugh said. Hollibaugh received her doctorate in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1999. She has taught Literature Humanities at Columbia and has taught in the Barnard pre-college program, Dean Blank said. Though Blank said hiring a candidate from within Barnard was a plus in choosing Hollibaugh, it was not a determiningfactor in the decision-making process. Eman Bataineh, BC 'O7 and SGA class president, said she was impressed by the future dean's level of comfort during the interviewing process. ""She asked very good questions, which to me indicates that she was thinking about student needs critically,"" Bataineh said. ""On the spot she came up with a pretty good list of things to be concerned about with student life and the Mcintosh Center going down and Nexus being constructed."" Blank said that Hollibaugh will workclosely with Dean Link during her first week in order to get a sense of what her responsibilities will be and how to carry them out. After that, Dean Link will officially leave the first-year deanship to cover study abroad full time. ""We're really thrilled that she's [Hollibaugh] going to be part of our office here and part of the Barnard administration and I think it's going to be a nice fit,"" Blank said. ""1 trust that she [Hollibaugh] will know how to fill Dean Link's shoes,"" Bataineh added."
420,CAMPUS An Evolving Career for a Darwin Devotee,12 February 2007,"An Evolving Career for a Darwin DevoteeBY MANDIE NOWAK Columbia Daily SpectatorSophomores, pay attention: Philip Kitcher is the current chair of Contemporary Civilization, as well as the John Dewey Professor of Philosophy here at Columbia. And today, on international Darwin Day, Professor Kitcher will discuss his latest book, Living With Darwin: Evolution, Design, and the Future of Faith. Darwin was released this past January. ""This book deals with two big issues,"" Kitcher said. ""The first is that it's concerned with the credentials of Darwin's theory. The second is to explore the possibly disturbing implications of Darwinism."" Kitcher has been fascinated with and written a number of books on the conflicts over Darwinism for almost thirty years. ""It was 1979 and my eldest son was just born, so my wife and 1 were both very tired all the time.One night I was up late and flipping through the TV guide, and of all things I saw an ad for a book by one of these rightwing religious types, so I sent away for it,"" Kitcher said. ""And I was surprised to find some of these arguments [for creationism] sounded quite plausible and challenging."" In 1982, Kitcher wrote his first book on the subject, Abusing Science—the Case Against Creationism. ""Most people believe there's no real problem with Darwinism,"" Kitcher said. ""In fact, I used to believe that too. So 1 wrote thisbook at a time when there was a lot of noise about the debate on Darwinism and Creationism.... I gave a lot of public lectures, participated in debates, and then it all died down. That was, until the rise of intelligent design in the mid-'9os."" One of the issues Kitcher's new book deals with is how intelligent design is a dead science, and so ""it's not a rival to Darwinism at all."" ""But there is something disturbing about Darwinism to religious beliefs, and I think we fail to understand the magnitude of the losses people would experience if religions were removed,"" Kitcher said. ""And this is symptomatic of a much deeper problem."" The self-professed ""dotty and eccentric"" professor didn't always used to be such a philosophy fanatic. ""1 grew up inEngland,"" Kitcher said, ""where we were required to specialize by the age of 15."" Kitcher went to Christ College of Cambridge University where he initially concentrated in mathematics. ""I think it's important for undergraduates to read this because they'll understand the enormous changes one can go through. I switched in college from mathematics to history and philosophy of science,"" Kitcher said. Kitcher came to the United States in 1969 and has lived here ever since. Before coming to Columbia in the late '9os, Kitcher taught at Vassar College, theUniversity of Vermont, the University of Michigan, the University of Minnesota, and University of California, San Diego. This semester will be Kitcher's final one as the head of CC. ""My wife and 1 are going to Germany next year,"" he said. He's coming back the following year, but not to teach CC. ""I may teach Literature Humanities,"" Kitcher said, ""or I may even teach Professor [Michael] Seidel's course on Joyce, and I would enjoy that very much."" Kitcher is a veritable renaissance man. While maintaining his earlier enthusiasm for mathematics, physics, and chemistry, he's been picking up more passions since coming to the United States. ""I'm interested in a lot of things—-that's the problem,"" Kitcher said. ""When I was at the University of Vermont, I was teaching a class and the students, who were mostly pre-medical students, were complaining about how all of my examples were from physics and chemistry. So I started reading up on biology and I got hooked,"" Kitcher said. Additionally, Kitcher has co-au-thored a book on Richard Wagner, the opera composer, and has a book on the way about James Joyce titled Joyce's Kaleidoscope: An Invitation to Finnegans Wake. And what does this modern Renaissance man plan to do in Germany?

421,Letter to the Editor,21 February 2007,"To the Editor: With his interviews to the press and the irresponsible piece he published in Spectator's opinion section on Dec. 11, Stephen H. Norwood seems intent on calling attention to himself and what he calls his ""findings"" about Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia, and the Nazis in 1936. Actually, the ""findings"" which so exercise Professor Norwood are thoroughly covered (pages 392394) in Nicholas Miraculous, my biography of Butler. Anyone interested in the issues Norwood raises can find them discussed there, but let me briefly respond to his allegations about Butler s collaboration with the Nazis. In 1936, the University of Heidelberg invited universities throughout the world to send representatives to participate in festivities for its 550 th anniversary. Although Norwood mentions only Harvard, Yale, and Columbia among the American universities accepting the invitation, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Vassar also agreed to send representatives. Butler, as I make perfectly clear in my book, failed to acknowledge the propagandists purposes behind the event. Such naivete is inexcusable but must also be understood in context. Butler, the president of Columbia from 1902-1945, had no illusions about Hitler or the Nazis, seeing them for exactly the political and moral degenerates they were. He did, however, esteem German scholarship and culture, having spent six monthsstudying in Berlin after earning his PhD. in 1884, and he maintained the foolish hope that somehow the spiritual and intellectual ideals of the past that he admired would reassert themselves and bring down the Nazi regime. Obviously, he couldn't have been more mistaken about this, but political blindness is not the same as deliberate complicity. Butler thought that by honoring the founding of Heidelberg, he would be honoring the tradition of humane learning so opposed to contemporary Nazism. He was no more seeking to enhance Nazi Germany's status in the world than were the 48 countries who sent their athletes to compete in the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin. Following a student demonstration outside of his house at 60 Morningside Drive to protest Columbia's participation in the Heidelberg event, Butler expelled Robert Burke, an activist student who gave a speech denouncing Butler's decision. It was an outrageous act by an autocratic president, but it had nothing to do with the specific issue of Heidelberg. Butler was constitutionally unable to tolerate student dissent of any sort He had a long history of expelling students and faculty who embarrassed or challenged him. In 1917, he expelled Morrie Ryskind six weeks before he graduated. Ryskind, who went on to write films for the Marx Brothers and win a Pulitzer Prize for the musical Of Thee I Sing, had committed the crime of mocking Butler as ""Czar Nicholas Murray Butler"" in an editorial he had written for the satirical Columbia publication Jester, complaining about thepresident's suppression of free speech on campus. And in 1932, as Norwood mentions, he expelled Spectator editor Reed Harris for criticizing the way the dining services were run. AD of these, needless to say, were unacceptable. But to state, as Norwood does, that ""it was weß understood at the time that Butler was punishing Burke for chaßenging him on Heidelberg,"" is nonsense. Even Burke declared that he was expeßed because of his insistence on the right of students to express their views through legitimate demonstrations. He refused to apologize for the demonstration, regarding it as a principled issue of academic freedom. The most insidious part of Norwood's piece is his suggestion that Butler""s antiSemitism made him indifferent to the horrific nature of the Nazi regime. Butler's anti-Semitism is a fact, most fußy documented in the pages of Nicholas Miraculous. But it was not anti-Semitism that led him to send professor Arthur Rerny to the Heidelberg celebration or to expel Robert Burke. Butler certainly had many things to answer for in the course of his 44 years as Columbia's president but the notion that he was trying ""to buUd friendly ties with Nazi Germany"" is not one of them. Despite Norwood's fooEshly melodramatic conclusion that ""Columbia must explain itself,"" the University, on this issue at least has no need to do so.

422,"What's University Writing, Anyway?",23 March 2007,"BY DAVID XIA Spectator Staff WriterFive years into its existence, students and faculty are still working to establish and understand the role of University Writing within undergraduate education at Columbia. The pilot course was taught in 2002-03, and the finalized version replaced Logic and Rhetoric as the Core's official writing course at the beginning of the 2003-04 academic year. Now, Columbia's largest Core course is under review by the executive committee on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Logic and Rhetoric, the brainchild of Professor Edward Tayler, was an integral part of the Core for two decades before complaints about a lack of clear objectives and funding brought about its demise. The course, which was based on the skills of expository writing, was replaced by University Writing, with its focus on reading academic texts and conducting research beyond assigned articles. One of the primary goals of the class is teaching students that academic writing is not conducted in a vacuum. ""We want students to learn how to enter into conversation with other writers, and we want to draw students' attention to the language they use in theii arguments,"" said Professor Joseph Bizup, Director of the Undergraduate Writing Program. Shayne Legassie, a Literature Humanities instructor who has had experience teaching Logic and Rhetoric and both the pilot and final University Writing courses, shared the same opinion. ""UW, CC, Lit Hum, and other core courses try to get students to see written work in a new way—not as the carrying out of an order but rather as an intervention in an ongoing intellectual discussion."" The essay-writing components of Lit Hum and CC tend to overlap, causing confusion among some students, according to Shilarna Stokes, a teaching fellow who instructs a University Writing course. ""There are a lot of people who have the idea that UW is meant to help them write essays for Lit Hum or other classes,"" Stokes said. ""It has its own worth."" Bizup disagreed. ""In University Writing, the main emphasisis on the students' writing,"" he said. ""In Literature Humanities, the main emphasis is on students' engagement with the literary texts. 1 don't see this as a conflict. I see the courses as complementing one another."" As designed, this complementary role for University Writing extends beyond Lit Hum to all other parts of Columbia's undergraduate education. The fact that revision and editing is incorporated into University Writing has garnered positive student responses. ""I like the workshopping,"" John Ruan, CC 'lO, said. ""Before UWI never revised and I never knew how much better my writing could be,"" said Ruan. The course, however, is often not suited to every student's interests, according to Ruan. ""I don't like how the course is structured so that you're forced to write essays based on assigned articles.'... It would be better if we could pick our own texts."" ""I've had my fair share of grumbling over the work required in University Writing class, but there's no denying the necessity of it,"" countered Leanne Penna, CC 'lO. When asked about the feedback the University Writing Program receives, Bizup responded, 'We are constantly gleaning responses and suggestions from students, instructors, and faculty. We are constandy working to improve the course for Columbia's students."" Legassie and Stokes both agree that the principle of academic writing needs to be articulated more clearly to students. ""I think a writing class is a great thing, but there needs to be more awareness across the curriculum that one's development as a writer is a lifelong process,"" Legassie said. ""He [Legassie] couldn't be more right,"" Stokes said. Writing is not a set of skills but a process and cannot possibly be done in one semester."" She added that many instructors feel it should be a year-long course. 'To some extent I feel that as a Literature Humanities professor I have to teach half my students how to write in the first semester because they will not have a writing class until spring,"" Legassie said. ""It's challenging to teach a class where only half of the students have had training in the conventions of writing in the humanities.""551s NEWS B« ANALYSIS"
423,Editorial Beyond the West Major Cultures must be reformed,23 March 2007,"Beyond the WestMajor Cultures must be reformedWhile the Core Curriculum courses Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization focus on the developments of Western civilization, the Major Cultures requirement aims to provide students with an understanding of the important historical, literary, and intellectual developments of the rest of the modern world. The goal of broadening students' educations is a good one, and the program's existence at Columbia is laudable. But the program has its shortcomings; in particular, students often complain that they do not get a thorough grounding in their culture of choice. The administration is currently considering improvements to the program, such as requiring more intensive colloquium-style courses in order to better fulfill the program's mission to give students a strong understanding of more than the Western world. This goal is a valid one, and administrators should move forward judiciously to improve the Major Cultures requirement and ensure that Columbia furthers its students' education without overburdening them in the process. As the requirement stands now, students must take two courses chosen from three lists: A, which are general courses, and B and C, which are more specific courses elaborating on concepts presented in the A courses. Students must take one List A course, and either a second List A course focusing on a different culture, or a List B or C course to explore more deeply the culture from their List A course. One reform to the requirements that has been suggested is to add courses to List A while improving the existing offerings. But it seems unlikely that this solution really would solve the curriculum's problems. It would effectively provide more general information and less of the enhanced understanding that students desire. These problems have led to the idea of implementing a more extensive Lit Hum/CC-style requirement of a colloquium course that would be based onthe major texts of non-Western cultures, exposing students to their historical, literary, and philosophical backgrounds. On the whole, this idea looks to be an improvement over the current requirement which often allows students to escape without a basic grounding in their culture of choice. The merits of this idea include the fact that it would provide small discussion-oriented classes and that it would systematically expose students to the great thinkers of non-West-ern cultures. Still, this suggestion does have some shortcomings: Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization depend on a student's existing base of knowledge of the history of Western civilization, which may not be possible for a colloquium on all of non-Western civilizations. As well, because such a course would encompass many varied cultures and civilizations that are themselves remarkably different, the course again could run the risk of being too shallow and over-reaching. But this last drawback could be circumvented by careful planning of the curriculum, as it is in CC and lit Hum when they are properly taught If changing the requirement to only a two-semester colloquium course is inadequate, a possible compromise would be to require in addition one or two more specific courses such as those on lists B and C. This would enable students to develop a broad foundational knowledge of the civilizations they study, upon which they could build in the later classes. On the other hand, this would leave students with even fewer credits to fulfill their major requirements, or alternately, require them to overload themselves in order to finish on time —neither of which is a desirable outcome. There is no clear best course of action for improving the Major Cultures requirement, but Columbia owes it to its students to provide them with a sound, well-rounded education, and working to improve the Major Cultures requirement would be a significant step in that direction."
424,IN FOCUS: Reviewing and Revising the Core,23 March 2007,"BY BRANDON HAMMERWhen 1 arrived on Columbia's campus at the end of August, I had no idea what to expect from the Core Curriculum. Sure, I had said in my application that it was one of the main reasons I felt drawn to the University. But I really did not know how it would feel to read a Lit Hum book every week or be asked to write ""college level"" essays. After a semester and a half, though, I've found that while I appreciate much of what 1 have learned from and continue to study in the Core, I still see a lot of room for change. The centerpiece of the Core for first-years is Lit Hum. This class has taken me on a whirlwind tour of some of the finest pieces of literature that have both emerged out of and shapedWestern civilization. I've found that this course is not just, as most people cynically say, ""a bunch of bullshit to talk about at cocktail parties."" Rather, I've found that I've seen how authors from Homer to Augustine to Cervantes came to terms with their humanity and social context, and how, in doing so, they have defined and redefined fundamental concepts, including glory, honor, love, and humility. Nonetheless, I find that this course does not completely fulfill its stated goal of encountering ""particular conceptions of what it means to be human."" This problem stems from the contradiction between the common name of this class, Literature Humanities, and the real name of it, Masterpieces of Western Literature and Philosophy. For, while I certainly begin to understand and debate the idea of humanity from reading and discussing Shakespeare and Plato, I feel that the debate and extent of my understanding cannot begin to be completed, or even sufficient, without reading the great wbrks from other parts of the world. Therefore, I think Lit Hum should include literature and philosophy that is relevant to humanity from all societies, not just the West.Aside from Lit Hum, Columbia College requires first-years to take University Writing and Frontiers of Science. Both of these classes have seemingly essential missions, but both have very practical problems. The ideology behind Frontiers, at first, seems great: to both give students a scientific basis of understanding and inform us of the most exciting and important developments in science today. The latter aspect has been a success. I have found the lectures about the universe, global warming, and quantum physics to be both engaging and essential to my understanding of the world around me. The problem, though, rests in the structure of die rest of die course. The means of grads ing is most frustrating, for the Weekly l\ Individual Assignments and the exams (I consist of very arbitrary questions thatessentially seem to ask, ""Can you guess what Scientific Habit of Mind I'm thinking you should use here?"" Moreover, these ""scientific habits,"" or methods of thought, seem very irrelevant to those of us who do not intend to go into a field of science. I, for instance, don't see the idea that ""correlation does not necessarily imply causation"" influencing my life after this class. Thus, 1 think the course should be changed to teach us about the frontiers and breakthroughs in the scientific world and allow us to discuss what these advents mean for the world. Like Frontiers, University Writing has a seemingly essential mission: to teach students to write college level papers. However, while some students have joined Columbia after having written novels, others have not had as muchexperience in writing. Moreover, the idea of judging writing based on just writing has always seemed futile and ambiguous to me. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the essays and perspectives I encountered and, like all English classes, appreciated the critiques and advice I received. The other main Core requirement I sought to fulfill this year has been the two semesters of science. In the first semester, I took statistics, and now I am taking astronomy. While both have been interesting, they seem irrelevant 1 will always appreciate that I now know where Venus is in the night sky, but knowing where the planet is won't really help me when I graduate. But if economics or personal finance were required courses, then I would understand the fundamental principles that drive many political and social forces that we see today in the world. Without a knowledge of basic economics, for instance, I really don't understand what it means that China is pegging its currency to the dollar, and therefore cannot fully grasp the lasting impact of that action. Moreover, I only know how to handle my personal finances t from what my parents taught me and r would greatly benefit from learning the importance of credit and other economic aspects with which I am clearly unfamiliar. I will probably take some economics course • because I realize the importance of knowing how to deal with finance, but I think it's essential that the University teach us the basics of finance and economics before 1 learn the physics of flying to the moon. In all, I've found that I appreciate the Core much more than I thought I would when I first arrived on campus. But there is still a lot of room to change. Lit Hum can teach the greatest Literature Humanities from all civilizations. Frontiers can change its focus so as to seem more relevant. University Writing can take steps so as not to have a published author and a novice writer in the same class, and the science requirement can be made to be an economics one that will focus on more practical and essential knowledge for a citizen of a globalized world. . hr T ... .• ' »»rv 'rr-.rr />rf+ •?>■«-< The author* is a Columbia College first-year."
425,Major Cultures: An Unfulfilled Promise,23 March 2007,"BY ALIDAD DAMOOEIMajor Cultures was introduced to the Columbia Core Curriculum to give students a more global perspective and understanding. While this is an important goal, the current organization of and approach to Major Cultures just does not fit well into the rest of the Core Curriculum. There is something lacking. As it stands, students chose courses from a List A, List B, and List C ""menu"" of sorts. List A courses are broad introductions to other civilizations, List B courses are more focused on particular aspects of these civilizations, and List C courses discuss topics relating to these cultures within the United States. While this approach provides basic cultural literacy, this structure does not create a cohesive educational experience as other aspects of the Core do. In Contemporary Civilization, students can see the progression of thought as a sense of historiography unites the entire syllabus. However, in Major Cultures, this often does not happen. This is a shame because Major Cultures has the untapped potential of being one solution to the criticisms often laid on other aspects of the Core, namely its heavy emphasis on Western culture. Literature Humanities focuses on the development of Western literature, Contemporary Civilization on the development of Western political theory, and Art and Music Hum on the development of Western aesthetics. I do not contend that we must change these fundamental aspects of the Core, nor do I think that our schedules should have to accommodate an increase in Core requirements.While Major Cultures attempts to provide some international perspective, it does not provide the insight into non-Western thought that courses like CC provide for Western thought. A simple survey of the history or politics of one or two non-Western cultures is not enough. A more cohesive educational experience that delves into the thought, literature, and philosophy of other cultures through the examination of primary texts could provide a much more substantive experience. It is one thing to memorize a list of philosophers; it is another thing to read and contemplate their philosophies. Courses that trace the development of thought and the intellectual interaction between different cultures would provide a more complete global education. They could also help bridge the many gaps that are created in classes such as CC, which do not fully investigate the intellectual contributions of other cultures to the philosophy and thinking of Europe. This could improve not only Major Cultures, but also the entire Core by contextualizing the contributions of Western thinkers within those of mankind. Of course, a single school-wide Major Cultures course that follows the model of CC or Lit Hum would be infeasible. It would be impossible to do justice to the many texts and thinkers of cultures currently unrepresented in CC and Lit Hum. Rather, the solution would be to offer a greater number of small, discussion-based courses that trace the progress of literature or philosophy in other cultures. This would still allow students to choose what non-Western culture they would like to study and the experience would be much more fulfilling.The colloquium model merits further consideration as an example of this type of education. For instance, first introduced in 2002, the Colloquium on Nobility and Civility teaches students about Eastern cultures through discussions on major literary and philosophical works. However, such courses are often difficult to manage, as they require team instruction and can only accommodate a limited number of students for any given section; due to such difficulties, there is a very limited number of colloquia currently offered. Unfortunately as our world becomes increasingly interconnected, the Columbia education must adapt to the globalized nature of world affairs. Through technological advancements, different cultures and peoples are interacting more than ever. The need to become an international institution is something that President Bollinger has acknowledged and for which he openly advocates. Yet this objective has yet to be reconciled with the nature of our Core Curriculum. As the president's Task Force on Undergraduate Education convenes to discuss issues such as, in the words of Bollinger in one of his emails, ""how well our curriculum serves the rapidly changing needs of an increasingly globalized world,"" it is necessary that the Task Force and president reevaluate Major Cultures. It all boils down to a single question: what does it mean to be a global university without a curriculum to demonstrate it? Words, ideals, and goals are nothing without concrete action. The author, a Columbia College sophomore, is the academic affairs representative on the Columbia College Student Council."
426,"Denby Praises Great Books Conference Speaker Says Core Combats Ignorance, Extremism",26 March 2007,"Conference Speaker Says Core Combats Ignorance, ExtremismBY DAVID XIA Spectator Staff WriterAt a conference on Core Curricula in the 21st Century, organized this weekend by core lecturers in Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, Columbia administrators, faculty, and students took a critical look at Western Humanities-based courses in higher education. David Denby, CC '65, Journalism '66, and a film critic and staff writer for the New Yorker who took core courses at Columbia a second time in 1991 to pen Great Books, a journalistic recount of his experience, kicked off the conference with his keynote address on the role of core curricula in wartime. Denby began his speech by describing the film ""300"" as a ""pornomilitary fantasia —a muscle-magazine fantasy crossed with a video game and an army-recruiting film,"" and pointed to general education as a means of combating ""ignorance and extreme belief."" Professors from Columbia, the University of Chicago, and Stanford—among other schools which have some form of core curriculum —discussed the evolution and place of a core in both a liberal education and aglobalized world. On Saturday, a student panel with Isabel Bussarakum, CC 'O7, Mark Krotov, CC 'OB, Spectator film columnist and Editor in Chief of The Birch, Jenni Old, CC 'O7 and executive cochair of the United Students of Color Council, Jeff Shrader, CC 'OB, moderated by Jonathan Blitzer, CC 'O7, discussed representation within the Core. ""Students have never really had the opportunity to voice their opinions in such a formal setting,"" said Classics major Sydney Cochran, CC 'OB, executive board president of Columbia Queer Alliance, an organizer of the student forum. Much of the discussions focused on the question of whether core curricula should be based more on course content or critical thinking. Denby explained that his return to Columbia's Core in '9l was caused by what he called the ""theory-based political attack on the Western classics."" After writing Great Books, Denby maintains he does not recognize the ""Western classics in the most extreme versions of the opposition from within the University—dead white males, that embarrassing phrase, the hegemonic discourse and all the rest of that."" Shrader said that the critical think-ing skills taught by Columbia's Core are more significant than the cultural background of its texts while Krotov said that the Core has not given him all the skills stated in its mission statement Citing a personal example, Bussarakum said Colloquium on East Asian Texts was the hardest class she ever took because ""these skills work well for the Western tradition, but they don't work well outside ofthat"" Students and faculty alike expressed that there is much at stake in investing in a core curriculum. While no one proposed abandoning core curricula, Oki and others' shared that feelings of an unfilled gap left by the Core. At the end of the dialogues many questions were left unresolved. The fact that a discussion was begun, however, was in itself meaningful for some.""I would consider progress simply an hour of dialogue,"" said Blitzer. ""There's not really a narrative here. It's nobody's history,"" said professor Philip Kitcher, the Chair of Contemporary Civilization, in the closing remarks, adding, ""It isn't such a bad idea to put Confucius side-by-side with Plato.""

427,Editorial Including Undergrads Students must have greater role in task force,28 March 2007,"Including UndergradsStudents must have greater role in task forceTJie President's Task Force on Undergraduate Education was formed this past fall with the purpose of evaluating the state of the undergraduate curriculum at Columbia. Made up of senior administrators, faculty, and the student body presidents of Columbia College, SEAS, and General Studies, the task force currently meets in individual working groups to address the issues of science education, globalization, teaching, and the structure of the curriculum. Given that the role of the task force is to evaluate undergraduate education, it is crucial that the administration incorporate students' input dirgptly into its research. Although a few student leaders sit on the task force, more must be .done to ensure that students have a strong voice in the decisions. The more input it solicits, the better the task force's position will be to serve the needs of the greater student community. The task force does not have direct power to enact specific changes to the curriculum. Instead, it serves as an advisory body, giving recommendations as to what changes are needed. This is not the first incarnation of such an undergraduate review. In fact, boards like this are formed about every decade. In the 19905, the Committee on Undergraduate Education, which included only faculty, issued a report recommending, among other things, stronger majors and more room for non-major courses within a student's schedule. However, many of the committee's findings remained unaddressed. That the task force includes senior administrators and students inaddition to faculty could make a difference in what recommendations ultimately are made and their likelihood of being enacted. The task force has considered several methods, such as surveys and forums, to solicit students' opinions. They have also considered holding town hall meetings open to the entire student body. However, larger forums like town halls are not likely to happen until significant progress has been made within the working groups. In addition, the task force should consider organizing small group discussions in specific Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and other Core classes. The committee also plans to reach out to alumni who have graduated in the past two or three years. Members are hoping that former students' experience with the Core will provide them with a greater perspective on what should be done. Getting broadbased student input and the opinions of alumni will provide the committee with better feedback than simply adding five to 10 students. Many good ideas for soliciting student feedback have been outlined by the task force. Now it must set concrete goals to ensure that its outreach plans are implemented. As it moves forward, it must keep its mission in mind and be vigilant in ensuring that student input is not ignored. Only then can it make the best recommendations possible and ensure that the curricular problems facing Columbia's undergraduate population are properly addressed."
428,"Not Just ""Dumb Jocks""",4 April 2007,"BY DAN BAJGERAs a student-athlete, I have encountered the myriad stereotypes and prejudices of many professors and students. In fact, after reading my first essay, my University Writing professor expressed surprise that I could write so well, saying he thought I was ""just another dumb jock."" Consequently, I have grown accustomed to the misconceptions of others. The books in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization should make Columbia students familiar with die Greek ideal of possessing both a strong body and mind. The Core Curriculum includes a physical education requirement and even a swim test out of a commitment to developing both the mental and physical aspects of students. Critics should pay closer attention to the text of The Iliad and The Odyssey and recognize that the Homeric values of glory and honor are deeply interwoven into the fabric of modern day athletics. The Columbia campus is enriched by the presence of athletes, just as it is enriched by the presence of artists, musicians, writers, and activists. If Columbia wanted, it could only accept students with perfect SAT scores. But, if that happened, there is a good chance many of the student organizations on campus would remain empty—for instance, the band might not have a drummer, or Columbia's reputation for activism might dwindle. In addition to test scores and grades, admissions officers take talent into account For example, being a concert pianist writing poetry, or throwing a baseball could factor into an admissions decision. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions pursues this kind of diversity so that ""intellectuals"" can be exposed to different viewpoints and personalities, engendering a vibrant and creative campus life. Ginia Sweeney's piece reflected both elitism and naivete towards the Ivy League admissions process. Neglected were legacy students, children of faculty members, or students whose parents donate large amounts of money to Columbia. All of these factors go into a decision for admission, and some weigh more heavily than others. As such, suggesting that the application process at Columbia is entirely equitable for everyone except athletes is blatantly wrong. The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in English and Comparative Literature."
429,Post-docs Get a Shot,6 April 2007,"BY CHRISTINE ORTIZ Columbia Daily SpectatorA new program from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is offering post-doctoral students a chance to get their foot in the door of the highly competitive academic world. During the two-year Core lecturers program, post-doctoral students are able to teach sections of Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities as well as a lecture in their home departments. Philip Kitcher, chair of the Contemporary Civilization program, said he believes that there is a difficult transition from Ph.D. to tenure track in the humanities and social sciences. He said he hopes the Core lecturers program will give doctoral students incentives to finish their Ph.D.'s, acting as a stepping stone for candidates who wish to get a professorship and start on the road to tenure. Provost Alan Brinkley first proposed the program, which is now in its second year. ""He believed it would be a good idea if the University had a program for people that finished their Ph.D.'s to lead sections of Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities,"" Kitcher said. Kitcher, along with Nicholas Dirks, vice president for arts and sciences, formulated the framework for the current program. In the program's inaugural year, ten lecturers from backgrounds including philosophy, history, architecture, religion, English, comparative literature, Slavic languages, and Italian were selected to teach CC and Lit Hum. ""It is really great to have such a diverse, qualified, enthusiastic, and fabulous group of teachers that bring a variety of perspectives on the text,"" said Deborah Martinsen, associate dean in the Center for the Core Curriculum. According to Kitcher, there is a rigorous application process and the competition is highly competitive. Beyond the Core classes, Core lecturers have sought out other means to contribute to the academic life of Columbia, includingsponsoring a conference on the Core Curriculum, which was held in March. Spearheaded by Debra Everett -Lane, a second-year lecturer in CC, the conference became a means for the Core lecturers ""to get together and organize because we have ideas and experience and feel there's more that we could be doing,"" Everett-Lane said. In addition to the conference, the lecturers are taking part jn syllabus reviews for both CC and Lit Humand have given input on the latter's final exam. Lecturers. complained that they lacked a sense of community. ""One of the minor problems is to find more ways of giving lecturers a real place in the University since they're not in a department like a grad student or a junior faculty,"" Kitcher said. Kitcher said the program's success is undeniable, though he said that he could not predict how it would evolve over time.A LEG UP | The Core lecturer program is a highly selective program aimed at helping post-doctorate students get on the road to professorships."
430,"Starting in Fall, New Course Required for English Majors 'Critical Reading, Critical Writing' Updates Former English Course",10 April 2007,"'Critical Reading, Critical Writing' Updates Former English CourseBY ZAHRA KHIMJI Columbia Daily SpectatorStarting this fall. English majors will be required to take a new class, Critical Reading, Critical Writing, to hone their literary analysis abilities. The class is a modernized version of an English course that has existed in the past. Faculty designed the course with the input of student representatives. According to English professor and undergraduate advisor Michael Rosenthal, Columbia's department of English and comparative literature brought the re tooled class back because of a ""lingering feeling and a desire of some students."" He said the restructured course would better equip students with basic skills such as being able to critically interpret literature as well as write well-structured and focused papers. Rosenthal stated that he is ""confident that it will be popular."" Students also expressed their belief that the course would fill a need.English major Patrick Jarenwattananon, CC 'O7, said that the new requirement will give English majors basic tools that will help them with their studies. English major Swetha Regunathan, CC 'O7, called the implementation of the revised class ""a good move,"" saying that she hoped ""the course won't teach students how to read theory, but rather how to read a text and write thoughtfully and elegantly about it"" Rosenthal said that the course's previous structure consisted of individual sections being taught by individual faculty members. The revised version will have faculty members giving one lecture per week with graduate students directing smaller seminars. Regarding the expectations for students within the course, English professor and associate undergraduate advisor Erik Gray said that it ""is up to tire people teaching it"" Each term, graduate students will choose their own assignments, and sections will vary from one teachingassistant to another. Gray said that the course is designed to help students learn how to read secondary sources as well as training them to read original texts more carefully and critically. He said that Literature Humanities and University Writing do ""not specifically teach students to write a paper"" and that their focus is different from that of Critical Reading, Critical Writing. As opposed to University Writing, which addresses structure and approaches to writing, the English course will focus on reading literature. Rosenthal said that English majors need a class that is more advanced than Lit Hum, saying that the Core course is like an ""introduction to the English major"" that, depending on the professor, may or may not focus on critical analysis. Besides giving students the ability to critically read and write, Gray said that Critical Reading will serve as ""a connection between you and your classmates."""
431,Our Real Free Speech Problem,11 April 2007,"BY DAVID EISENBACHLast fell, I created Friendly Fire, an interview series broadcast on Columbia University Television, after reading and hearing a chorus of prominent individuals from across the political spectrum—from Nat Hentoff to Mike Bloomberg to Bill O'Reilly—question Columbia's commitment to free speech. Even Fox's right-wing firebrand Sean Hannity and his liberal nemesis Alan Colmes could agree that Columbia had a free speech problem. As a teacher and a proud alumnus of Columbia College, I wanted to defend Columbia by engaging our critics publicly and challenging their assertions that our University stifles free speech. But after hosting events with a few of Columbia's harshest critics, including Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice and Bob McManus and John Podhoretz of the New York Post, I've concluded that Columbia does have a free speech problem. But it's not ours alone, and we share this problem with every other university, community, and govermnent that tries to guarantee a truly free and open exchange of ideas. What I discovered hosting Friendly Fire is that the very nature of free speech is problematic. Particularly tricky is deciding how we as a university or a society can encourage an open airing of ideas that are inevitably going to be offensive and upsetting without beating each other up, figuratively or literally. After all, free speech is not always nice, and it's not always politically correct A solution to this problem is to offer a forum like Friendly Fire, where controversial speakers are given the opportunity not only to voice their opinions but also to defend them. Following aprovocative interview, guests face a tough Q and A from our Columbia-educated audience. I was incredibly proud to see our students apply the philosophical lessons they learned in literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and their other courses as they challenged and interrogated guests. One of my students even stumped the formidable Post columnist John Podhoretz with a question about the woefully inadequate media coverage in the early days of the Iraq war. Creating a free speech forum that allows for the rigorous but civil exploration of tough issues isn't easy. Sitting on stage during the events, I could feel the intense emotional energy that passionate debate generates, and I now understand how easily an event can become a free-for-all like the Minuteman fiasco. Friendly Fire, however, was able to present three informative, entertaining discussions without incident We showed the critics that Columbia is not stifling free speech—that in fact the University is providing a forum for it Even the guys from the Post were impressed. Our discussions also revealed something surprising about Columbia's critics. When I asked Nat Hentoff why he wrote that the University was ""engaging in the dangerous undermining of the First Amendment across the land,"" he conceded that he might have been using ""hyperbole."" When I asked Bob McManus why the New York Post dismissed Columbia as ""a PC Playpen,"" he chuckled and said he was just using the ""playful language"" common in all his editorials. There are great benefits to having controversial speakers come to Columbia to defend their ideas. One is that our own ideas and beliefs cannot beconfirmed unless they are challenged. Another is that we discover the thoughts of writers are a lot more nuanced than their published words —after all, they are in the business of selling newspapers or driving up ratings. Regardless of whether the audience members agreed or disagreed with our guests, I think everyone walked away from each event with a better understanding of the messy world of ideas. My plan is to continue bringing controversial speakers to campus to face Friendly Fire. But that brings me to another problem raised by free speech: freedom to speak is important, but access to a platform from which to be heard is critical. At Columbia, just like in the ""real world,"" gaining access to those platforms costs money. The expense of this year's Friendly Fire series was shouldered entirely by the Columbia bookstore. Neither the guests nor I received any payment yet the security and staging costs reached thousands of dollars per event Going forward, we cannot expect the bookstore to carry the burden alone. In order for Friendly Fire to survive, we will need the support of the University. I believe University President Lee Bollinger's frequent statements about Columbia's commitment to free speech. The true test of any commitment however, is not in the words we use to express it The true test comes with the sacrifices we make to secure and maintain our commitment. The author hosts Friendly Fire, a free speech conversation series broadcast on CTV. He is a Core lecturer and teaches courses on American politics and media."
432,It's Hard To Reconstruct the Big Easy,17 April 2007,"BY RUTHZEE LOUIJEUNEAs we keep up to speed with current events, we read the same headlines: ""Sectarian violence in Baghdad,"" 'Two American soldiers dead in Afghanistan,"" ""15 British soldiers freed,"" and other hot (controversial) topics that are making us stop in Lerner Hall to pick up a copy of the New York Times. While these issues of foreign policy are vastly important to America, the overwhelming press coverage of international issues has overshadowed the coverage for the many burgeoning domestic concerns of this nation, as evidenced by the lack of support for the reconstruction of New Orleans. On Aug. 29, 2005, one of the worst natural disasters in American history ravaged communities in the New Orleans and lower Mississippi area. Almost twenty months later, some areas have been able to recover, while stagnation plagues the reconstruction of low-income and hardest-hit areas. Thousands of victims are still without homes, without schools, and without hospitals. Yet their needs remain unaddressed by this government. Dr. Edward J. Blakely, former president of the New School and experienced urban planner, has recently been appointed executive director of the Office of Recovery Management, in order to bring a sense of order and progress to the people of New Orleans. Nevertheless, he and other city planners are still struggling to obtain increased funding from the federal government whichhas prioritized other projects and issues over the reconstruction of New Orleans. What has allowed the victims of Hurricane Katrina to float to the peripheries of this nation's consciousness? In his 2007 State of the Union address, President Bush mentioned matters critical to the American people, yet highlighting the ongoing plight of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina must have slipped from his memory. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been the iconic symbol of failure that continues to disappoint Katrina victims. One must not interpret the failures of FEMA, however, as the sole cause at the beginning or the end of the spectrum for the reasons behind ongoing difficulties in New Orleans. Mayor Nagin and Governor Blanco must also serve the reconstruction interests of their constituents and not other interests. We must hold our government as a whole accountable for the protection of its people, regardless of class, color, or country of origin. Dialogue on Hurricane Katrina has dwindled from our conversations and our articles for two reasons: first, it makes us uncomfortable, and secondly, we have difficulty relating to the misfortunes of others who are miles away. It is uncomfortable to admit that there are specific communities to whom the American government turns a blind eye. We make a conscious choice not to admit it, for it would disrupt the ideals of universalism preached to us in Columbia College courses like LiteratureHumanities and Contemporary Civilization. If we were to hark on this idea of universality, however, this would confound the second reason, seeing as universalism should increase our ability to see ourselves in others, especially since the victims of New Orleans share the same American identity as members of Congress, as our President, and as many of us here at Columbia. Hurricane Katrina is no longer an American issue, but rather an issue of particular communities. If Hurricane Katrina and the current reconstruction era are representative of anything, it is the deeper racial and economic wounds of this nation. It must not be interpreted as a partisan issue. Recovery, relief, and protection do not practice party politics. We must challenge our government and ourselves to critically analyze who is deemed important to and included in the American polity. Such critical analysis will help us understand why New Orleans, 20 months later, is in danger of becoming a playground for corporate interests, ensuring that marginalized communities in the Big Easy remain under water. The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in political science. If you would like to find out more information about the post-Katrina situation or find out how you can be of assistance, please refer to the various activities occurring this week through N. O. W. (New Orleans Week)."
433,Episode Six: The End of the Begining,24 April 2007,"In the previous episode, I promised some coherent thoughts about how we might use our information technology to improve our education systems. I intend to do a little of this, but in the meantime I've come to a realization: this is my last column. The once-dim light of liberation has become dazzlingly bright, and I'm hammering this out in between final projects. If you're reading this, you're probably killing time between your last few classes. The specter of exams looms large, hi another week, your future will hang in the balance in a series of three-hour trials-by-fire, your success or failure dependent entirely on the caprice of cruel and overcaffeinated graduate TAs and whether or not you manage to remember the right quotation from Milton's Areopagitica or how quickly you can multiply four-by-four Hermitian matrices in your head. But all this you know—l am merely restating the well-understood. I wish to give voice to the two questions that logically follow. The first—""ls there no other way?""—is asked often enough, and is understandable but not particularly enlightening. The second—""ls this actually working?""—is, I would submit, somewhat thornier. Even honest answers will vary, of course, and depend on what you think an education is actually for. Let me for the moment say that there are two ends towards which an education can be directed, and let me call them ""technical"" and ""humanistic.""Technical education is often equated with vocational training, but should be understood as the development of techne, the art or science of doing something. Humanistic education, in contrast, can be understood as the pursuit of the ""why"" of using our techne—we have acquired these skills, but in whose service shall we apply them? To what end? Shall we use our powers for good, or for awesome? What, to make it perfectly explicit, shall we do with our lives, and why? In theory, a democratic society with well-educat-ed citizens will choose good policies. It will adapt to changing circumstances, it will interact benevolently with its neighbors, it will engage in war solemnly and only in the most dire necessity. But ours is a society of poorly-trained human beings in which technical wizardry is paramount We manufacture weapons with trivial ease—the difficulty, it seems, is in using them wisely. The university continues to struggle with the task of encouraging students to ask the central questions of humanistic education. Recent events in this country—the heightening xenophobia that has accompanied every military incursion and orange alert since the beginning of the ""War on Terror,"" the shrill, fact-free posturing on both sides of the political spectrum, the absence of informed, civil debate in the mainstream media, the impressive disregard for scientific knowledge in critical matters of science policy—the list goes on—are uninspiring. These events seem to suggest a substantial and increasing strain on the nation's educational apparatus. To those who don't spend much time using it, the Internet may seem a strange place to look for aid—certainly, there's a lot of trash out there. But the central problems with higher education as it stands are logistical, not theoretical. Making humanistic education available to a wider population isabout opening up the closed conversations which, for the moment, are happening in the classrooms of those students fortunate enough to land in sections of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization and their analogues elsewhere with the best professors. But if the conversations are centrally about ideas, as we are told they are —we are taught that we are in conversation with Montaigne, sitting around the fire with Woolf, or watching Socrates drink his hemlock—and if these ideas can find sufficient expression in the written word, then these conversations can be digitized. Digitization holds out the promise of solving the faculty-to-student-ratio problem by allowing the conversation to take place out of real time and in virtual space. Let us be clear: this isn't a sales pitch, but a warning. The digitization of the university isn't something I need to agitate for —it's already on its way. Like most technosocial developments, it'll be on us before we have time to think carefully about what its implications are, much less how best to manage them. Things are happening faster now—we're going to have to devise better methods for learning about them, and for acting on our learning. I'm going to make a bizarre point to wrap this up. Away messages on instant messaging services are harmless (if rather vacuous) digital post-it notes for the global digital fridge, but they may have also been the first step on the long road to a global collective consciousness. I feel like we may want to watch out for this sort of thing. For now, this is left as an exercise for the reader. M.

434,"Graduates Oversaw Changes In Morningside, Conflict on Campus",16 May 2007,"BY JAMES VIELKIND-NEUN Spectator Senior Staff WriterColumbia is a disparate place. Students keeps themselves as busy as the city that surrounds them, which means that ""campus community"" is a slogan largely reserved for recruiting pamphlets. But despite the separate paths students have taken, the ""campus community"" has found a united focus when major news has broken. For the Class of 2007, it has been a regular occurrence. From admissions letters, this class was reminded that in 2004, Columbia was celebrating two and a half centuries as a place of higher learning. The 250 th class admitted to the University was showered with an anniversary bash worthy of a King, or his College: Wyclef Jean performed at Homecoming; Ric Burns, CC '7B, debuted a documentary film about Columbia's history; a giant cake in the shape of Low Library proved to be an anticlimax when students realized the for-alumni-only confection was hollow; and Ben Stein, CC '66 hosted a Columbiana competition between the undergraduate schools (the College won) before fondly recalling how nice it was to stumble the streets of Morningside Heights drunk. Stein retreated to the tavern formerly known as the West End for some drinks of a refreshing sature. The 'Stend, the storied hangout beatniks and underage guzzlers ""whet _ Columbia hadits first beer,""was made over i:, i u fluorescent-orange Cuban restaurant called Havana Central in 2006. The conversion came a year after Amsterdam Cafe, the mirror dive bar one avenue east was remade into an upscale Tapas lounge. Before the bars, grocery stores were changing the face of Morningside Heights. Morton Williams brought 24-hour glitz to 115 th Street and an expanded Westside Market will soon reopen. The bigger news in the community is Columbia's expansion. Less than a month after the glamour of the main events of Columbia's C 250 celebration passed, University President Lee Bollinger held the first of many meetings with students about the proposal to build a 17-acre campus in the Manhattanville section of West Harlem, and details of the multibillion dollar plan gradually emerged. The next spring, Bollinger presented renderings to Community Board 9, and the proposed campus has since become a towngown point of contention that has strained Columbia's interactions with its neighbors. Many are concerned the University is moving toward asking the state to use the power of eminent domain to acquire all the property in the proposed footprint, and local business owners have vowed to mount a legal battle if it does. Columbia is now working with a specially formed local development corporation to negotiate a community benefits agreement for the project that will address the needs of current residents and business owners as its planners navigate the lengthy land-use reviews that will be required for the project While some students have expressed concern about Columbia's all-or-nothing approach to the proposed campus—earlier this year the Student Coalition on Expansion and Gentrification declared South Field blighted in an ironic protest of eminent domain and sponsored an art exhibition to show a creative take on the current community—they have not needed to look off-campus for opportunities to be active. Before move-in was completed during freshman orientation, canvassers for Graduate Student Employees United Local 2110 had distributed buttons supporting an ongoing drive to be recognized as the official union of research assistants and teaching assistants. Organizers claimed that a majority of graduate students signed union cards,but Columbia refused to recognize GSEU. In the spring of 2004, the union called a strike. Demonstrators inflated a giant rat, and many students expecting to finish their core classes that spring were greeted at Hamilton Hall with a sign proclaiming ""Union Now!"" hung around Alexander's neck and empty rooms. Administrators held firm, and the strike fizzled. A smaller version reprised in 2005, facing a similar end for the summer holiday. The other demonstrations in the spring of 2004 began brewing in December 2003. Long-standing feelings of marginalization among students of color were inflamed by a series of racially insensitive incidents: the Columbia College Conservative Club held an affirmative-action bake sale; the marching band made jokes about the Ethnic Studies major in flyers promoting its semiannual ""Orgo Night;"" and the printing of a cartoon in The Fed, a satirical newspaper, depicted a string of offensive stereotypes about AfricanAmericans in a mock history commemorating Black History Month. In response, an ad hoc group called Columbia University Concerned Students of Color organized a weeklong sit-in on Low Plaza where demonstrators wore signs proclaiming ""We have been silenced."" They demanded administrators take steps to make Columbia a more tolerant place, and spurred the creation of the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Issues of tolerance flared again two years later after two students painted racial epithets, homophobic slurs, and anti-Semitic graffiti on the door of a suite in the Ruggles dormitory. The pair was charged by police with vandalism as a hate crime. The suit was later dismissed after a plea deal that included sensitivity training for the vandals. The incident touched off another round of protests in April 2006 by a new ad hoc group, Stop Hate on Columbia's Campus. Demonstrators formed a human circle creating a ""safe space"" for all students on Low Plaza Three days of protest led to a commitment by the Office of Multicultural Affairs to hire an advisor for LGBT students and mandate diversity training for incoming first-years. An underlying issue for both SHOCC and CUCSC was the notion of a University as a space for the free flow of ideas where various viewpoints are tolerated, engaged, and debated. In both instances, protestors responded to breaches of the unwritten code that mediates discourse on campus. In response to this, student leaders organized to create a Community Principles Initiative to delineate the shared values of students in the University. In the spring of 2005, this debate over academic freedom took center stage. In a documentary by a Boston-based Zionist group called the David Project, several Jewish students alleged that they were intimidated in the classroom by professors in the Middle East Asian Languages and Cultures department who are openly critical of Israel. Outside media attention —including a front page story in the New York Daily News denouncing Columbia as a ""Poison Ivy""—whipped up debate over exactly what and how professors should teach and how students could seek recourse if they felt they were treated unfairly. A specially commissioned report concluded there was ""no evidence of any statements made by the faculty that could reasonably be construed as anti-Semitic,"" but recommended an overhaul of student grievance procedures. The protests have dogged Bollinger, a renowned free-speech scholar who has placed less emphasis on day-to-day management than developing and implementing a vision for a grander Columbia. While the expansion is one cornerstone of those efforts, Bollinger speaks of Columbia as a ""global university"" that will prepare students to think multidimensionally and participate in an era of unparalleled globalization.As various committees debate changes to the University's curriculum and overhauls of student life, Bollinger has begun to implement his vision by strengthening relations with alumni and convincing them to open their wallets to fund his dreams. There have been several high-profile successes. This year, the University officially kicked off a $4 billion capital campaign to upgrade facilities and bolster its endowment In March of 2006, Dawn Greene, the widow of the late lawyer and banker Jerome L Greene, announced a $2OO million donation to build a science research center in Manhattanville.. Then, in April of this year, media mogul John Kluge, CC '37, announced that he would bequeath $4OO million to improve financial aid at the University. In recent years, Columbia students have urged administrators to be more generous in defraying the cost for students from needy families, and after pressure from the student-driven Financial Aid Reform coalition, agreed to replace loans with grants for families earning less than $50,000 a year. Then a man named Jim Gilchrist came to visit A California native and the founder of an anti-illegal immigration group called tire Minuteman Project Gilchrist was invited to speak on campus by the Columbia University College Republicans. Not a historically rightleaning student body, students from several groups organized protests against a man they perceived as racist They marched. They turned their backs and booed during the introductory speech. Then some of them rushed the stage. What ensued was a melee during which one student was kicked in the face, ending Gilchrist's presentation just minutes after it began. Columbia was once again in the news with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly saying students were engaged in a ""left-wing jihad"" before suggesting that Columbia be renamed the ""University of Havana-North."" Exactly who should be allowed to speak—the echoes of earlier debates about academic freedom — had erupted two weeks earlier when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was invited to speak. Logistical concerns about security and the format of the polarizing figure's remarks caused Columbia to renege on tire invitation. Just days after Gilchrist's speech was interrupted, the Nobel Foundation announced that two Columbia scholars —Edmund Phelps for economics and Orhan Pamuk for literature —had received the Nobel Prize in the same week. Also in the fall, revolutionary Czech playwright Vaclav Havel took up a se-mester-long residence at the University. But unlike previous springs, Low Plaza has been largely devoid of demonstrators this semester. The largest demonstrations had nothing to do with Columbia, but rather the war in Iraq that has raged since most of the Class of 2007 arrived and human rights abuses in Sudan. That""s not to say there hasn't been news: the dean of financial aid resigned amid a growing scandal on the practices of studentloan companies. First-year students saw their Literature Humanities final thrown out last week when an instructor leaked the answers to students. There was malaise about the choice of a B-list actor as a Class Day speaker. Students within the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race released a report denouncing the state of ethnic studies at Columbia. Barnard President Judith Shapiro, announced that she would be stepping down, following a similar announcement made in the fall by Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science Zvi Galil. But the rallies, sit-ins, and marches that have been the mark of a passionate and often divided campus in past springs are nowhere to be found this year. The Class of 2007 comes together today for the last time as a University community, ready to pose for another recruitment brochure."
435,Survivng the Core,3 September 2007,"BY MARIA INSALACO Spectator Senior Staff WriterLove it or hate it, Columbia's Core Curriculum is a beast with which we must all do battle. With this in mind, here are some insider tips from up-per-classmen for conquering the Core, one class at a time. Literature Humanities • Like most literature classes, this one ( requires that you actually read the texts. Spark Notes can tell you that Achilles cannot control his pride and is driven by a desire for glory, but what can they tell you about Astyanax orAjax? . • Read your books with a highlighter. • The quotes on the final exams at the end of both semesters are the same for ALL classes, so even if your professor pointed out a few key lines in class, there may be other quotes on the test. Again, you have to read the books. University Writing • So much of this class depends on the instructor you get, so don't compare your grades to those of your peers. You'll either end up with an inflated ego or extremely frustrated. • Plan to finish your paper a few days early and see if your instructor will look at a draft. Similarly, once you get your paper back, see if you can rewrite it and turn in a new version. • Reviews about the Writing Center have been mixed. Some say it is the best way to get help on a paper, while others claim it's useless. If you're struggling with a paper, going to tire Writing Center once may be a good idea. Frontiers of Science » While everything is placed on a coursewide curve, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to do well in Frontiers, just the basics: go to the lectures, turn your homework in on time, and study for the final. • If science makes less sense to you than ancient Greek, try stopping by the Help Center or working with your seminar instructor. Gateway • Described by most SEAS students as an unavoidable evil, Gateway is a nit-picky, detail-ori-ented class that may leave you wondering how it actually prepares you for other engineeringclasses. The one piece of advice most SEAS students agreed on was to be sure that you perfectly understand instructions and that you follow them precisely on assignments. • Know how to navigate the Gateway Web site before Internet-based homework is assigned. Contemporary Civilization • You don't need to do all the reading. Wikipedia can be an invaluable tool in learning the main concepts for each work. • Don't skip class. Discussions are the foundations for exams and essays. Plus, missing class will really annoy your professors and make them more likely to grade your work harshly. If you have weekly discussion postings, suck it up and do them. • Study with classmates before exams. Make it a structured session where different people are assigned different works to present for review. While you might not understand Kant, one of your friends might have found him to be an easy read. Exchanging ideas will help you both. Major Cultures • These classes are reading-intensive, so don't mix them with Lit Hum and two history classes. • Don't tell your parents, but don't do all of the reading. Get to know others in the class, split assignments, and create short outlines. Skim with a highlighter and type notes during class. Before exams, gather as a group and make sure everyone is clear on the main concepts of each book or article. Warnng: this strategy only works if you diligently pursue it throughout the semester. Leaving it for two weeks before finals is a recipe for disaster. Art & Music Humanities • The extent to which these two classes are bearable (or maybe even enjoyable) depends entirely on finding a good professor and class time. If you work late on Sunday nights, taking a class on Monday at 9 a.m. is not the best plan, not matter how good the professor is. • Shop around. Register for this class each semester that you can get into it until you find an appropriate time slot and a good instructor. As always, you can find reviews of most professors on CULPA."
436,"Welcome, 2011. We Mean It This Time.",4 September 2007,"BY JOSH HIRSCHLAND SPECTATOR SENIOR STAFF WRITERFinally, a year of students who followed each other on Facebook through the entire admissions process and came out a super-bonded amalgamation of prefrosh. Before ever setting foot on campus, they were joining groups like ""Columbia 'll works hard but parties harder!!"" Coming to campus, not only would they be as annoyingl'y too-cool as past years' classes, but their collective haughtiness would be better organized. Against better judgment, I signed up for my fourth and final NSOP experience. The class got off to a rocky start. Students unloaded five blue bins' worth of stuff onto College Walk and sat sleepily through most of the opening-night celebrations. On Tuesday, students neglected to forfeit their seats on a crosstown bus to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to elderly New Yorkers who were trying to get home. And yes, they walked five abreast on the sidewalk, blocking anybody on their path. Far more prevalent, though, was theiroverall sense of unity and respect and their unabashed enthusiasm for what is to come. At the first Literature Humanities session of the year, they came prepared, gamely stepping to the mic to debate the Greek leadership in the ending days of the Trojan War. At the big party on Ellis Island, people not only showed up but kept grousing to a minimum despite long lines and being stranded in New York Harbor. Even at CU: Take One—nee The BlaZe and formerly CUnity—orientation leaders had to restrain their groups—afterwards, my group ate ice cream on Low Steps. For some reason, the students seemed to display a maturity that other first-years have lacked at this point in their Columbia careers. Perhaps the most telling moment of the New Student Orientation Program was Monday night when the CAVA ambulance never ran its siren. (Unofficially, the first CAVA-ing of a drunk freshman wasn't until Wednesday—as opposed to Monday, when it had happened in previ-' ous years.) More people attended a free ice cream event put on by Hillel than the biggest party of the week held in a firstyear residence hall. At the annual Community Forum, I watched with a jaded eye a video detailing Columbia's controversial history. The film neglected to name the members ofthe Minuteman Project as the ""controversial speakers"" who prompted last year's major protest and didn't mention that the Office of Multicultural Affairs was formed as the result of a week-long sit-in held in response to expressions of racism on campus. As I scoffed, though, I looked over at the two first-years who were sharing my pew who watched unfazed, as though they were above it all. Perhaps they didn't place as much merit in the deep divisions which are too often present on this campus as they should, but what appeared to me —then as during the rest of the week —was a group of students that was tied to one another, willing to work through the problems and toward unity. At the last formal event of the week, students dressed to the nines in suits, dresses, and fedoras, dancing in Lerner Hall at an event that seemed more like a senior prom than the first-year mixer that it was. As I watched, I thought to myself: maybe those extra months connecting online really did something positive. Maybe they forged a bond that will serve them better than previous classes. Or maybe I'm just a nostalgic, delusional senior. One thing is for sure: if the energy on display this week is any indication, these guys should be fun to watch.HANDS UP | Audience members vie for green T-shirts distributed by the Re-Up Gang during orientation concert."
437,Lit Hum Students Prepare To Retake May's Final Exam Jin Apologizes to Students in E-mail,5 September 2007,"Jin Apologizes to Students in E-mailBY DAVID XIA SPECTATOR STAFF WITERWhile most Columbia students are starting the new semester fresh, some sophomores are studying for the final exam of a Literature Humanities course that should have ended last May. Due to a leak of the Lit Hum final exam at the end of last semester, an ad hoc committee of faculty and administrators decided to invalidate the results of the test and to give enrolled students the chance to take a make-up exam next Friday. Instructors notified studentsof their grades for the semester without taking into account the compromised exam and then gave them a choice between keeping that grade or taking Friday's exam. Eva Gonzalez-Ruskiewicz, CC 'lO, confirmed earlier reports that the person in question was her instructor, associate professor Wen Jin of the English and comparative literature department In an e-mail to her students, Jin wrote, ""I apologize for having involved the class in the Lit Hum final incident, which has certainly caused much confusion anddistress for you. 1 inadvertently compromised the exam when trying to prepare the class for it and I accept full responsibility for the spreading of the information I provided during the review session."" Student reaction to the committee's decision have been mixed. ""If there was time before finals week was over, I think they should have offered a second final at that time,"" said Lori Khrimian, CC 'lO, whose work commitments over the summer did not leave her any time to prepare for the make-up test she would have liked to take. ""Unfortunately, I do think they [the committee] did the right thing,"" Gonza-lez-Ruskiewicz said. For Jason Zhang, CC 'lO, preparation during the summer months was notoverly burdensome. ""During the summer you're not as busy as you are during the school year so you have more time to study and prepare."" The committee's announcement, emailed out in May, did not say whether students would be allowed to change their minds after the end of last semester. Student sentiment toward Jin also varies. ""I believe the professor is the one fully responsible,"" Matt Kudelka, CC 'lO, said. ""I think it was the students' responsibility to spread the answers ... so that one student doesn't have an unfair advantage."" '1 think they're being a little harsh about it"" Gonzalez-Ruskiewicz said. She said she believed her instructor acted out of the best intentions. ""She wanted us to prepare and show her our best effort instead of cramming everything in at the last moment"""
438,Students Retake Botched Lit Hum Final,13 September 2007,"BY DAVID XIA SPECTATOR STAFF WRITEROn Friday, Sept. 7, dozens of Columbia College sophomores retook the Literature Humanities final exam from last semester. The retake resulted from assistant professor Wen Jin's disclosure of questions on tne exam to her class, from which they spread like wildfire among the class leading to the invalidation of the exam. According to Kathryn Yatrakis, dean of academic affairs for Columbia College, a total of 46 members of the class signed up to take the replacement exam. When asked about changing the Lit Hum final exam to an unstandardized format to avoid similar problems in the future, Yatrakis said, ""In many ways a standardized exam instigates and encourages discussion amongst all first-year students no matter what section they attend or instructor they have."" Michael Rosenthal, a professor in the English and comparative literature department agreed. ""It'd be a terrible mistake,"" to disband a coursewide exam that supports the ""integrity and coherence of the course,"" Rosenthal said, remarkingthat the incident that had never happened before at Columbia and will likely never happen again. As for Jin, she retains her title as assistant professor in the English and comparative literature department, but, according to administrative and faculty members, she is no longer teaching Lit Hum. She is currently teaching two courses: PostModernist Texts & Theory and Asian American Literature & Culture. According to Rosenthal, much of the faculty was disturbed by Jin's choices. ""I hold the professor totally responsible for what happened,' he wrote in an e-mail. It has been a difficult situation for students, faculty, and administrators alike, but Yatrakis pointed out, ""I'd rather focus on the good number of students who let us know what had happened as well as those many, many students who studied hard for the exam and felt let down that their hard work was not as clearly demonstrated as it other wise might have been."" Each student's individual instructor will grade the retake and change students' final grades accordingly. David. Xia can be reached at david. xia @columbiaspectator. com."
439,Meet Me on 116th and Pompous Ass Avenue,27 September 2007,"BY VESAL YAZDISpectator wants you to pick the next first-year columnist. Three finalists will run during the week and readers may vote for their favorite online at Columhiaspectator.com. Oh, the pangs of Literature Humanities burn within my very core and spread like a cancerous disease, reaching my very extremities! Without inducing any further gagging, Lit Hum is the melting pot in which Columbia provides two avenues of distinct dichotomy. One path is for the would-be-but-will-never-be philosopher, and the other is for the normal, sane Columbia intellectual. Let me make the distinction more obvious: one group throws terms like ""a priori"" and ""neo-democratic"" as many times as they can in discussions of Use Iliad , while the other group is content with phrases like ""Achilles totally hammered those crazy Trojans"" and ""Do you reckon Patroklos and Achilles got it on?"" 1 must say, there is another group that doesn't say anything at all,which is a shame, since they could be instrumental in overcoming the former group, here known as Group Pompous Ass. As far as 1 know, the core, of which Literature Humanities is a part, is intended to foster breadth of knowledge and to teach students the ways of analyzing text and constructing intellectual argument. I certainly didn't enroll for a heated debate between members of Group Pompous Ass on how The Iliad may represent a democratic society, which allowed Achilles to protest Agamemnon's behavior. You can't be serious, trying to transplant a modern political construct in a book with some big guy on clouds throwing lightning bolts and some sissy who stole some other guy's lady (referring here to Paris and Menelaus, of course). To some extent, I admire the attempt. 1 remember our first Lit Hum class. We had the chair of Lit Hum, Gareth Williams, introduce us to our first analysis of Homer's text. As soon as the first comment was made, a domino effect occurred, and it didn't take long to see many eager hands flying in theair and people approaching the microphone. Funnily enough, almost all of them received applause. Even funnier was the fact that the speakers thought their comments deserved applause. Sadly, half the auditorium was patronizing and parodying our fellow colleagues. If anything, Williams salvaged any remnant of dignified discussion, responding very diplomatically to the sometime questionable comments made in relation to the stimulus text. Now, I'd also like to point out that I do not discourage the pursuit of greater knowledge and heated intellectual discussion. In fact, there are people who can carve out the big, verbose calls but actually make sense. I admire those rare breeds of people. But when you're a high jumper running to get over the bar of greater knowledge and instead slam straight through the bar and face-plant on the ground, that's when it's time to wake up to reality and take it one bunny hop at a time. Another typical Group Pompous Ass characteristic is the ability to say the simplest things in the most verbose, vomit-inducing way pos-sible. And to top it off, they have another member of the Group Pompous Ass to reiterate exactly what the other member said, two seconds later and in slightly different words. Group Pompous Ass serves to impede progress, make mountains out of molehills, and force the eyes of the sane person to roll out of his or her sockets. The next time I had class, I decided to provide some comic relief. Recall the embassy made to Achilleus in order to try to get him back to the battlefield. My argument was that Achilleus made uncharacteristic statements on honor on the basis that he was completely intoxicated. Before the embassy left to visit Achilleus, they had ""filled the mixing-bowl with pure wine and passed it to all""; they had passed the courvoisier and ""drunk as much as their hearts wished"". Not a good start to their plea. As they approach the shelter of Achilleus, amongst all the battle and strife, we come across ""Achilleus delighting his heart in a lyre."" Achilleus is clearly in his own magical world of musical rapture. Upon acknowledging his guests, he calls Patroklos to ""mix usa stronger drink,"" implying they had already had a strong drink. The passivity in Achilleus' statements can only support my probable theory that he was tankecf. For some reason, my theory didn't go down too well with my professor, who laughed and swept it quickly under the table. In light of this, I think the burden of responsibility here to create the right Lit Hum environment lies with the professor. My Lit Hum professor is actually fantastic. He seems to have mastered the art of diplomacy and of dodging Group Pompous Ass comments. So if your Lit Hum class is starting to reek of pseudo-intellectualism, your professor has the ability to control where the discussion starts and where it ends, who contributes and who is denied. Professors revolutionize not just the standard of teaching, but also the method of teaching, so that the core can take on a more evolutionary role, molding around the needs and wants of an ever-changing incoming class.

440,"After 30 Years on Campus, English Professor Seidel Goes to California",28 September 2007,"BY DANIELLA ZALCMAN SPECTATOR SENIOR STAFF WRITERWhen I walk into Michael Seidel's sixth-floor office in Philosophy Hall, he's seated at his desk contemplating a yellowed copy of Finnegans Wake squarely centered in front of him. ""You know,"" he says, ""every time 1 read this book it becomes ricner. What a novel!"" Seidel's enthusiasm is contagious—since joining Columbia's English department in 1977, he has taught everything from Literature Humanities to a course on the modern comparative novel. This semester —his last at Columbia—Seidel is teaching two final seminars: one on James Joyce's Finnegans Wake and another on Vladimir Nabokov and Samuel Beckett before moving west to California at the end of the year. What's been your favorite class to teach? Lit Hum is the all-time favorite, then Joyce next. The Finnegans Wake seminar has been exceptional. That class—crazy in that no one in the country is insane enough to teach it at the undergrad level except me and no one crazy is enough to take it except Columbia students—has produced one play by a School of the Arts enrollee, one documentary film by an undergraduate on the Joyce Society at the old Gotham Book Mart, one newspaper piece by an undergrad on Joyce's daughter, Lucia, one long essay by an undergrad on Joycean hospitality for an academic journal, and even helped with a book on Finnegans Wake by Columbia's own Philip Kitcher, who sat in on the seminar and contributed brilliantly to it in its first year. The most ridiculous paper topic you've ever seen? The 18 chapters of Ulysses as 18 holes on a golf course.Have you ever failed a student? Oh, yes! In fact, after I failed one particular student, her mother gave me a gift certificate for dinner at a fine New York restaurant because she said that I was the only honest person her daughter had ever dealt with. The most embarrassing moment you've bad as a professor? As chairman of the English department I dashed off a letter to Deans Bynum and Yatrakis, hit the spell check and change button to correct any errors, and the letter arrived to Deans Atrocious and Benumb. What's the biggest change you've seen in the Columbia campus over the past 30 years? In the undergraduate students. There's no doubt about it. When I started at Columbia, if you were selling pencils on Broadway you could get in. It was a very different deal. It was when New York was in the doldrums. And as New York goes, so goes Columbia, and the change has been extraordinary. Your favorite guilty pleasure reading? I've found that most academics like mysteries. I don't, but I will read some good westerns, like Cormack McCarthy. Your favorite book that you've authored? Streak —it's about Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak. He's just a childhood hero. Besides, that's the only book that's made any money. Advice for current Columbia students? Just remain New Yorkers. Your favorite run-in with a famous author? I saw the back of Samuel Beckett'shead once, in Paris. Unmistakable coiffure. If you could only teach one book to Columbia students? Ulysses. If you could make one change to the Lit Hum syllabusf I would add Paradise Lost —as 1 did. If you could date any literary heroine, who would you pickl Elizabeth Bennett? No, too easy. I would like the face that launched a thousand ships. Let's go with Helen of Troy—but only if you give me Marlowe's line [from Doctor Faustus], After literature, what is your greatest pleasure in life? Baseball. What was your favorite class when you were in college? That's hard—there's a favorite teacher and a favorite class. My favorite teacher taught metaphysical poetry, but my favorite class was on modern British literature. When you were 10, what were your vocational aspirationsl Clearly, a baseball player for the Yankees. What now? Well, my wife has just opened a brand new independent school north of San Diego, and pretty soon I hope to be teaching some seventh through twelfth graders. Are you going to have them read Ulysses? Maybe! An elective in Joyce. But not Finnegans Wake —not just yet. Danieua Zalcman can be reached at danielD.zalcman@columbiaspectator.com."
441,Letters to the Administration To The Columbia University Dean of Admissions,24 October 2007,"To The Columbia University Dean of AdmissionsBY EDWARD BEAULAC SPECTATOR STAFF WITERAs you are no doubt aware, college admissions have become increasingly competitive over recent years. While in the past, strong high school students were all but guaranteed admission to good schools, nowadays, even students with perfect SAT scores may end up on the street, unwanted degreeless. Students' chances of gaining admission to top undergraduate schools are further lowered by the onslaught of intelligent, hard-working students from overseas seeking a stateside education. As a result, the oudook for promising students who wish to gain entry to schools like Columbia is very grim. Many argue that one of the real problems of this increased competition for acceptance is the fact that the decisions that lead to admission are often arbitrary. When criteria such as GPA and SAT scores are all equal, admissions officers such as yourself are forced to determine acceptance based on recommendations, essays, and other information sources that don't lend themselves so easily to objective comparison, leaving qualified students conftised when they aren't accepted to the appropriate schools. This needs to stop. We need an objective way to decide between otherwise identical candidates so that we may ensure that only the finest are admitted to our esteemed and noble institution. We need a means of identifying the quick wits, guts, and thirst for glory that typify the ideal American high school student. We need to bring back the epic Nickelodeon game show Legends of the Hidden Temple to use as a final test for candidates for admission. Don't laugh. Stanford University did a study that concluded, ""Those stalwart champions of Legends of the Hidden Temple, who solved the labyrinth ana bested the temple guards, have been shown to havea much higher IQ than the rest of the population and they also go on to achieve much greater levels of success than their peers who did not conquer the Sacred Temple."" (Disclaimer: 1 am required to state that no such study actually took place. Ever.) Ibelieve that the findings of this masterful, visionary study prove that the best way for us to break those ties in the admissions game is to send high school seniors headlong into Olmec's perilous temple. The Stanford study (Recall: there was no study) notwithstanding, this makes intuitive sense. One need only think of Indiana Jones, who pilfered numerous temples in a series of BBC documentaries about his life. What was he doing when he wasn't raiding sacred grounds for holy relics? He was a university professor. The parallels between this raider of the lost ark and the ideal incoming Columbia student are pretty clear. The skills required to solve the diabolically challenging puzzles in a temple, such as the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, are the same skills that students need to write a last minute paper on Jane Austen for Literature Humanities: quick thinking, intense focus, and the ability to do the manifesdy obvious with no sense of shame or humility.Admittedly, there are some problems with this model. The most obvious problem is that, as we all know, the temple guards are union members. Given Columbia's problems with unionizing graduate students a few years ago, it's difficult to believe that Columbia would extend health benefits and satisfactory wages to the immortals who guard Olmec's sacrea temple from pilfering children. After all, why would you provide health insurance to deathless shamans who are unlikely to need check-ups or dental care? The second problem with utilizing this American game show as a standard for admissions is ■ that it neglects international students. A show about stealing relics from ancient temples is clearly geared toward Americans and this method would significandy disadvantage anyone else. Luckily for us, Nickelodeon has already covered this base with Global Guts. Such a tide is obviouslv suited for an international demographic. Although there was no Stanford study done on Global Guts like there was for Legends of the Hidden Temple (again, I am forced to say that this is not true and I made it up), I feel that a similar constitution is required for finding success on both shows. Please take this suggestion into serious consideration. All too often, togh school students are left in the dust wondering where they went wrong. It's not their fault—they are currently at the mercy of arbitrary judgment. Bringing back the beloved Nickelodeon game shows of the early '9os will not only give these students a fair shot at objective consideration, it will also finally give Columbia students and alumni athletics worth watching.

442,"Columbians Line Up for Yogurt, Burritos",2 November 2007,"BY JORDAN FRAADE COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATORWhen two chain restaurants came to Morningside Heights recently, they fed into many residents' worst fears—that existent local businesses would lose ground to these national franchises. Local favorites like newspaper store Global Ink and Cuban restaurant La Rosita are out, and chains Chipotle and Pinkberry are in. And, if the lines outside are any indication, they're doing better business than almost anyone else in the neighborhood. Chipotle, a fast-food burrito chain that opened in June, regularly sports lines reaching out the door and onto Broadway. Pinkberry, the Southern California-based frozen yogurt chain, opened a store on Broadway last week, and has been doing equally well. Lines on the first few days of business stretched out the doors, and even now, they reach back to the front doors. Chipotle franchises are known for selling only naturally-raised meats and making the burritos to order, as-sembly-line style, rather than heating them under a lantp —practices which makes all the difference, frequenters said. James Mcßroom, CC 09, described himself as a regular patron of Chipotle. In addition to praising the quality of the food, he also noted Chipotle's convenience. Its presence in the neighborhood, Mcßroom said, provided a welcome complement to Taqueria y Fonda la Mexicana, the beloved eatery on Amsterdam Avenue that serves traditional Mexican food,rather than Tex-Mex. Rakeyah Evans, a recent Columbia College graduate, also emphasized the quality of the food, saying, ""It's fresh, it's good, it's fast, and it's nutritious."" Justin Faye, an economics teacher who lives on West 100 th Street, said he believes Chipotle would be popular even without college students in the area. Many Columbia students and neighborhood residents, conversely, see Pinkberry's popularity as a result of its ambience and word of mouth. Yanna Mikhailova, BC 09, said that curiosity brought her to Pinkberry for the first time. Several students from the Los Angeles area said that they told their friends about Pinkberry, and one student even said that he decided to go after his Literature Humanities teacher recommended it. Pinkberry's decor has also proven a major selling point. Sunny Shin,a teacher living in Harlem, said the store's lighting and design made it look clean and well-lit. ""It's new, it's hip, and it's trendy,"" Eric Wander, Journalism 'O6, said. The store manager of Pinkberry, who goes by JC, noted that he has seen equally long lines at Pinkberry stores on both the West and East Coasts. He attributed these lines to curiosity. ""The people in the neighborhood see a new business and they want to know what's opening in their neighborhood."" At the same time, he listed a healthy product, hip decor, and friendly staff as factors contributing to Pinkberry's popularity. He expressed hope that over time, Pinkberry would become an integral part of Morningside Heights, saying, ""We're glad to be in the neighborhood!""

443,Systemic Racism Here?,2 November 2007,"BY JONATHAN HOLLANDERLike many other members of the Columbia community, 1 was shocked by the response to the recent bias incidents on campus. However, mv dismay did not result from the actions of the administration, but rather from those of my fellow students, some of whom have seized upon recent events and twisted their meaning to reflect an activist political agenda. Not only do I believe that this smacks of political opportunism, but more seriously, it demeans the importance of the cause—opposition to racism—that these individuals supposedly represent. The first point that needs to be addressed is the assertion that racism at Columbia is nor only pervasive, but also condoned and tacidy encouraged by the University. In his Spectator article ""Not Just an Isolated Incident"" (Oct. 26), Andrew TilletSaks listed four racist incidents—and alleged several more —that pointed to systemic bigotry within the Columbia community. He then , made the assertion that Columbia was responsible for these abhorrent acts because of the racist climate created by the Core Curriculum and the administrations insensitive response to hate crimes. Before we accept this statement at face value, we should first apply some rational scrutiny in order to determine both the scope of the problem and its causes. Lets begin by assuming for a moment that all four of the racist events listed by Mr. TilletSaks were undeniably perpetrated by members of the Columbia community, despite the lack of evidence substantiating this claim. Either way, four racist incidents since 2004 in a University of 20,000 hardly seem systemic and institutionalized. Moreover, this doesn't even take into account the student turnover at Columbia, which would increase the number of students (and possible bigots). Compared with hate-crime statistics for New York City as a whole, racism at Columbia isactually less common. Columbia has a rate of .02 percent hate crimes per person (assuming 4 crimes divided by 20,000 people), while the city average is .024 percent (1900 crimes between 2000 and 2004 divided by 8 million people). Additionally, one should consider that many of the crimes in the New York City statistic reflect incidents of murder and physical assault, actions that thankfully have not occurred at Columbia. Even though racism at Columbia is less pervasive than in the city as a whole, I, like most reasonable individuals, consider any instances of racism to be too many This is why it is important to understand the causes behind these actions. During my two years at Columbia, I have consistently heard many activists argue that racism at Columbia is the result of the cultural insensitivity of the Core, combined with the University's ""hostile"" policies toward both ethnic students and academic departments. If the causes of bigotry were actually this simple, however, I doubt racism would be as troubling an issue as it truly is. Firstly, the idea that the Eurocentricity of the Core creates bigotry is fallacious for several reasons. One of them is that the Core is not as Eurocentric as some activists would have us believe. The Core includes four classes that could be reasonably considered Eurocentric Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, and Music Humanities. However, this is offset by the two Major Cultures classes and four semesters of foreign languages, which are designed to be diver-sity-building elements. Yet, even if we do assume for a moment that the Core is Eurocentric, how does this engender racism? Are we to allege that every bigot on this campus is a student of4ooo-per-son Columbia College, spurred to action because of the cultural insensitivity of the Core? This question actually leads us to the larger issue of what motivates a racist. Does someone hang a noose on a door because they feel thatColumbia University's lack of funding to the Afri-can-American studies department legitimizes their anions? Or rather, is it because of emotional and social insecurity, isolation, and most importandy, ignorance? Ultimately, when we use reason—the foundation of CC—to examine these outrageous contentions, we quickly see that they are little more than crass political moves designed more to elicit emotion than rational discourse. The final point to consider is the University's attitude toward racism as a whole. Columbia's administration has been routinely attacked for its supposed intransigence in response to hate crimes. However, what exacdy would be an appropriate response? Would University President Lee Bollinger's presence at an anti-racism rally seriously make it any more effective? To assert that Lee Bollinger—the man who defended affirmative action in the Supreme Court—is not just insensitive to minority issues, but is actually a closet racist, is absurd. The administration's actions have been motivated by the correct belief that the appropriate response to hate crimes is to allow the police to investigate, apprehend, and prosecute the offenders. Fundamentally, Columbia University is not a racist institution. Slavery, segregation, and the Holocaust were all racist events—Manhattanville is not. Racism is a powerful charge, and just because activists need something to protest does not give them the right to makelibelous accusations against their own University. Hijacking issues and incidents by labeling them as examples of racism is a dangerous tactic. It not only limits the open discourse of our University community, but more importandy, it demeans the value of die term, so that when real racist events do occur, they don't receive the consideration they deserve.

444,THEATER Columbia Rolls Out the Purple Carpet For CU Players' Agamemnon,9 November 2007,"Columbia Rolls Out the Purple Carpet For CU Players' AgamemnonBY JACQUI STOLZER COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATORWhile anyone can recognize the value of the literature studied in Literature Humanities, many students may find themselves wondering how it applies to anything but academia. A few members of CU Players had a similar thought. They began asking themselves, as producer Ameneh Bordi said, 'Why are we, the theater community at Columbia, not integrating with the Core?"" Last semester, a few of the group's members, including Bordi and director Maryalice Parks, proposed the idea of producing Agamemnon to the Core Curriculum Committee, which offered much encouragement and support. With additional support from various student councils and other groups, the cast of 16 has been rehearsing for the past month and a half, and it will be performing on Nov. 11, 14, and 16. After struggling to secure a space for production, the team ultimately agreed to use two spaces—Agamemnon will be performed in Low Library on Nov. 11 and in Roone Arledge Auditorium on Nov. 14 and 16. Consequently, much of the challenge of producing this show has been making it adaptable to two very different spaces and using both within the span of a week. If you skimmed this work or simply need a refresher, Agamemnon is the first play in Aeschylus tragic trilogy, the Oresteia. It tells the story of King Agamemnon's homecoming after the Trojan War. Because he sacrificed his daughter before the play begins, Agamemnon is subsequently assassinated by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover.While the text has all the elements of a classic Greek tragedy, Wednesday night's rehearsal revealed that this performance will be far from traditional. There are no Greek pillars or statues on stage, but instead there are several creatively arranged door frames. Chorus lines are recited neither monotonously nor in unison, but are broken up and appropriated to different actors, accompanied by compelling choreography. Despite the long passages that characterize the text, the stage is full of movement. The production and design teams have tried to make the show stimulating to a modern audience not merely with camouflage and coffee cups, but also by highlighting the play's relevance to today's issues. ""The mom mourning over the loss of her son in the war —you know that. You've seen it on the news,"" said Bordi. Another striking aspect of this performance is the intimacy created between the actors and the audience. The staging of the play is nearly in the round, inviting tne audience to feel like part of the action. ""You are in the town. You can see the people, and you can see their faces and understand what's going on with them,"" said Bordi. In facing many production obstacles, working with a difficult script, and striving for an innovative angle, those involved in the production of Agamemnon have had their hands full. ""It reallv turned into quite a large project. I don't think we knew quite how big it was going to be,"" said Bordi. But it appears that the team's ambition will be rewarded—they have produced a show that should not be missed. Tickets are $3 in advance, $5 at the door, and free for Lit Hum students. They can be reserved by e-mailing CUAGAMEMNON@gmaiI.com.AGAMEMNON Low Library, Sunday Roone Arledge Auditorium, Wednesday and Friday 8 p.m. $3 In Advance $3 At the Door Free for Lit Hum students"
445,"University May Merge GS With CC After Years of Discussions, Integration Appears Likely",12 November 2007,"After Years of Discussions, Integration Appears LikelyBY VARUN GULATI AND DAVID XIA COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATORThe School of General Studies is moving toward a possible merger with Columbia College, according to a report issued in May by the Task Force on Undergraduate Education. The report was driven by a desire to integrate GS into the greater undergraduate community. It makes specific proposals to expand GS's financial aid and housing and to integrate the School's student services and admissions with those of CC and SEAS. The document suggests a merger with the College as one way of achieving this. ""Out of our discussion has emerged, if not yet a consensus, at least an interest in considering a new relationship between GS and the other undergraduate schools, one that could even lead to an actual merger of GS and the College,"" the Task Force, which is comprised of administrators, students, and faculty members from CC, SEAS, and GS, stated in a report presented at a May meeting. Many view the proposal—versions of which have been discussed several times since the 1980s —to be closer to realization than ever. The measure has substantial momentum from several administrators, who acknowledge that a closer relationship between the two schools would help GS recruit more and better applicants by providing larger financial aid packages, housing, and administrative resources. General Studies Student Council President Niko Cunningham, who sits on the Task Force, expressed confidence that students will see tangible effects of such talks. ""There are students here today that when they graduate from GS, their diploma will say something different than mine does."" ""The curricular differences are minor at this point, and we're going to be looking into whether we should collapsethat distinction altogether,"" Vice President of Arts and Sciences Nicholas Ditks said of the potential integration. A LOOK BACK The discussions mirror those from 13 years ago when administrators made a concerted effort to integrate SEAS and CC through the creation of a joint Office of Student Affairs under Dean Chris Colombo. The integration allowed SEAS to access a much larger pool of financial and administrative resources, a crucial step for allowing the school to grow, according to SEAS Interim Dean Gerald Navratil and SEAS Vice Dean Morton Friedman. In the past 10 years, the school has seen its applicant pool triple and has gone from admitting about half of all applicants.to a record-breaking 18 percent, while still increasing the size of its student body. While the 1994 move has been credited for improving relations and fostering a sense of community between SEAS and CC, administrators say that SEAS has maintained its own identity. Although undergraduates in SEAS and CC live in the same residence halls, have access to the same advising resources, and are allowed to register for many of the same classes, Navratil stressed that SEAS retains its own faculty and departments. ""The fact that we partner with the College where it's a mutual advantage doesn't mean we're 'merged,'"" he said. No final conclusions have been made as to what degree CC and GS would be integrated, but it is possible that the merger"" would mirror that of SEAS and CC from the 19905, where the integration would be limited to a bureaucratic reshuffling and light curricular changes. This shift might alleviate many of the concerns voiced by GS students. Cunningham said GS is excluded in many ways from the structural and social environment reserved for CC and SEAS. He cited housing, financial aid, and even the Office of Multicultural Affairs as concerns. ""While SEAS shares in centralized services with the College, the school [GS] has preserved a separate identity ... GS doesn't share any centralized services,"" Cunningham said. MAKING THE CASE Although the idea of greater integration has been raised repeatedly in the past, the recent discussions come in light of the fact that differences in curricula and faculty between GS and CC have increasingly diminished. According to Peter Awn, Dean of the School of General Studies, in 1995 the University decided to separate GS from the test of its continuing education programs. ""If you look at any other university, colleges for non-traditional students are always embedded within a continuing education ... environment.... Now you have a freestanding college for nontraditional students,"" Awn said. Originally, the differences in academic requirements between GS and CC were a product of separate faculties in the two schools, according to Awn, who added that during the 19705, Columbia was ""one of the most decentralized universities in the Ivy League."" It was not until the 1990s that the faculties for the Col-lege, GS, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences were united under the Faculty for Arts and Sciences, currently headed by Dirks. The report targets three areas of concern for the Task Force to address: uneven academic stature of GS students, isolation from the undergraduate education, and the inability of GS students to participate in the undergraduate curriculum in equal degree to those in CC. An alignment of the curricula followed the unification of the faculty. GS students, like their counterparts in the College, have Core requirements including Art Fdumanities, Music Humanities, and University Writing, and although it is not mandatory, they may sign up for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations. ""There used to be two separate curricula between the College and General Studies, and that's all been eroded,"" English and comparative literature Professor Michael Rosenthal said. He added that an evening curriculum for GS students who have jobs during the day has been eliminated. Thus far, the Task Force has advocated an even closer binding of the two curricula by recommending the addition of enough sections of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization to the current two sections available to GS students, estimating the cost to accommodate all who are interested at $1 million annually. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we find that within the next five years even the Core Curriculum is going to be identical,"" Awn said. SEPARATE IDENTITIES? Beyond academics, integration between GS and CC will potentially affect admissions, financial aid, housing, and student life. The Task Force report suggests integrating GS admissions with the Undergraduate Office of Admissions for CC and SEAS with the understanding that GS students are evaluated under different criteria that are still as rigorous as CC and SEAS admissions standards. Navratil said moving under the same Undergraduate Admissions Office had been largely beneficial for SEAS, and an admissions merger would probably benefit GS as well. ""They [GS] will have access to a large amount of resources, and can grow into a larger organization.... They might just use that as we've [SEAS] used it, to increase the quality of the students,"" he said. ""There's a lot of things you can do with a deeper applicant pool."" On the other hand, Awn said, ""I tend to think that's a bit of a ted herring because Columbia College does its own kind of admissions very well. They wouldn't know what to do in dealing with non-traditional students."" To further attract applicants and support GS students, administrators have discussed increasing financial aid, which lags behind that of its two peer undergraduate schools, and expanding University housing for GS students. ""Most of us are financially independent [from our parents], so we get a lot less [aid] than CC students. That's something most GS students are very bitter about,"" Natalie Johnston, GS, said. ""Any GS student would give up any otner benefit just for that [financial aid being combined]. I mean, I would. That's been my biggest problem and I feel like I've been somewhat deceived.""The Task Force recommended a hybrid financial aid package for GS in which students with parental contributions receive aid comparable to CC students with alternate packages for those without access to parental contributions. The report also suggested providing expanded University housing for GS. The Task Force concluded their report with the suggestion that, as happened with the creation of the Office of Student Affairs, GS student services could be integrated with those of CC and SEAS. Among CC and SEAS students, the idea of GS becoming more socially integrated generates some unease. Daniela Cassorla, CC 'lO, said she thinks inherent differences in age and life experiences between the student populations of GS and the other two schools necessitate a separation of the services and functions the schools provide. Administrators and students on the Task Force say they want to preserve what keeps GS unique while not impinging on the unique identities of CC and SEAS. ""GS has a unique feature of having a non-resident, part-time college experience,"" said Navratil, who added that a merger would not necessarily change the school's function or character. ""We don't want to amalgamate it [GS] in a way that causes it to lose its very special distinct functions and identity,' Dirks said. Further, Seth Flaxman, CC 'O7 and former CCSC president, said ""I'm more concerned about how well an institution serves people than the ideological purity of the institution itself,"" adding that the proposal ""does not mean that every CC student's apocalyptic fear of old people stalking their dorm hallways will come to life."" ""If you really believe that nontraditional students who want a very traditional Ivy League education and who are as intellectually capable as any other undergrad,"" said Awn, "" if you think they add an important dimension to the intellectual discourse and the community life of this University, then we should embrace them as equals."" CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS A potentially significant factor for administrative integration is decreased costs, Rosenthal pointed out. ""It may be that if you combine the two [GS and CC], you cut out a layer of administrative expense,"" he said. Flaxman agreed, saying, ""This could be a really cheap way to expand the College without putting more students into classrooms, thus allowing us to be more competitive against Princeton, Yale, and Harvard."" Dirks responded to such comments, saying that ""It's not about downsizing.... It's about customizing the way in which we do these things so that we do it better."" Additionally, Cunningham said he believes that, at least in the short run, there will be increasing costs associated with the integration. ""There's an infrastructural cost that is undeniable. We have to hire more professors, get more seats in class for core classes.... There will be a lot of growing pains,"" he said.

446,Editorial RAISE YOUR VOICE Core Reform Major Cultures must become a more central part of the curriculum,13 November 2007,"Core ReformMajor Cultures must become a more central part of the curriculumThe following editorial is the second in a week-long series concerning activism and involvement at Columbia. The severity of the strikers' protest methods and the criticism surrounding their demands raises importatn questions about the place of students' voices in affecting change at the University. Reform to the Core Curriculum is a central part of the strikers' demands, but has also been a concern for many other students. The administration has suggested that it is willing to begin the slow process of change, and there is much to be said about the nature of Major Cultures and its place in the Columbia tradition.Among the laundry list of concerns from the students who are hunger-striking is a call for reform of the Core Curriculum. While many of the strikers' demands are overly broad and misdirected, administrators should heed their call for call for change to the college's class requirements. Every student should graduate from Columbia College having thought critically about tne ways race, class, and gender affect the human experience both in Western civilization and throughout the world. These issues are as much a part of our society as Adam Smith's invisible hand or John Stuart Mill's ideas of liberty, and the University's Core should reflect that. These hunger strikers are not the first students to call for major changes to the Core. For years, students have derided Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization for their Western focus. Both courses include only a handful of works by women and non-white writers and thinkers. In recent years, the Committee on the Core has made efforts to address these concerns, adding a twocourse Major Cultures requirement that aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of nonWestern cultures. While the addition was a good first step, as it is currently structured, it does notcompel students to examine meaningfully the mores and intellectual history of non-Western cultures. -Instead of an afterthought, Major Cultures should be the third prong of a rigorous and challenging curriculum. Like Lit Hum or CC, this should include a small seminar that immerses students in a particular culture and allows them to engage and understand it. This course should also address the ways in which members of the culture immigrated and live in the United States. This would provide students a chance to understand how race and ethnicity shape a particular culture's experience in our country, with particular attention to the struggles of assimilation and institutional designs that make life more difficult. There are already a handful of courses that do this, such as Latin American Humanities, a two-se-mester literature and culture class. However, the University should require every student to take a one-se-mester seminar that not only deals with a culture of his choice, but also address the issues of race and class that play ou within that society on a global level. Barnard is already taking steps to rethink its Nine Ways ofKnowing, and Columbia ought to follow suit. Although the list of demands from the hunger strikers is long, Core reform should not be lost in the shuffle."
447,Editorial Time to Concede Hunger strike should give way to negotiations that include entire campus,16 November 2007,"Time to ConcedeHunger strike should give way to negotiations that include entire campusWednesday night may have marked the peak of the ongoing hunger strike. The candlelight vigil and protest held outside Hamilton Hall and the rumors circulating around campus that the administration intended to shut down negotiations and forcibly remove the strikers' encampment on Butler lawn pushed the drama and tension to new heights. On that same evening, the administration announced more funding for the Office of Multicultural Affairs and a $5O million overhaul of the Core Curriculum's Major Cultures requirement. These actions came on the heels of a campuswide e-mail sent by Vice President Nicholas Dirks that addressed changes already in place relating to the strikers' demands. Now that the strikers and their supporters have gained the administration's ear, they ought to cease their confrontational course that risks alienating their fellow students and pursue avenues of negotiation that adequately represent the opinions of all students. Some of the strikers' demands, most notably the proposed changes to Major Cultures and the soon-to-be-required anti-oppression training, affect the entire student body, not just the coalition of strike supporters —and in making them the strikers have in effect presented themselves as a legitimate voice of the student body. Yet in truth this is far from the case: many students disagree with the strikers' demands, and many others are put off by their extreme methods. Moreover, many students are offended that the strikers are essentially speaking on their behalf without their consent. Regardless of the innate legitimacy of the demands—in some cases unquestionable, while in others, highly suspect —it is unproductive for the strikers to raise their voices above those of the student body in order to push through their agenda. It is equally disheartening that the administration has treated the strikers as though they represent the student voice.On the other hand, the administration is far from blameless. Many of the ""concessions"" the administration has made in fact are extensions of projects already in place. Additional faculty for ethnic studies were promised several years ago, and the University already has considered altering the major cultures requirement to be more like Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities. These programs have stagnated in Columbia's bureaucracy rather than moving forward to completion, and this is a legitimate cause for outrage on the part of strikers and non-strikers alike. Yet while the newfound openness the administration has displayed of late is heartening, it does not indicate a shift from systematic oppression to lack of prejudice—rather, it represents a temporary overcoming of the bureaucratic inertia and indifference that plague the administration as a whole. The University is appallingly apathetic toward its students regardless of their race, culture, or sexual orientation. The hunger strike has wrought tremendous ideological polarization on campus. Last night, a group of students protested the protesters, while Facebook groups for and against continue to gain members. If any positive change is to come to the Columbia community then the fissure which have been created must be mended and negotiations must be opened with student representatives that reflect the opinions of the entire student body. There exist legitimate fora for students to seek institutional change at Columbia, among them CCSC and the University Senate, that can claim a democratic mandate and broad canvass of student opinion—now is the time for them to be employed, and for the administration, for once, to listen: not to what a group of strikers with dubious popular support demands, but to what the student body as a whole thinks best.How To Submit to Opinion: Spectator Opinion is always seeking submissions from diverse areas of interest.

448,Editorial Better Together? Possible merger must consider differences between GS and CC,20 November 2007,"Better Together?Possible merger must consider differences between GS and CCLost in the frenzy of the recent hunger strike was news that the Task Force on Undergraduate Education has begun to examine the possibility of a merger between Columbia College and the School of General Studies. The idea has been discussed on some level for decades, but recent talks have taken on a more serious tone, focusing on the reality of combining the schools' curricula and administrative services. A move to unify the undergraduate experience and integrate the two administrations would be a smart one, but the differing needs of CC and GS students—both curricular and logistical—should not be ignored if such a proposal is enacted. In recent years, GS students have raised concerns about the disparity between the school's quality of life, educational experience, and resources as compared to those of Columbia College. By eliminating redundancies between the two institutions, a merger could reduce operational costs and the bureaucratic inefficiencies so familiar to the University, as it did when SEAS and CC joined to form a single Division of Student Affairs. But more importantly, the merger would correct the considerable differences between the CC and GS curricula. As it stands, GS students hoping to enroll in Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization must apply for a limited number of spots in designated sections. The Core, as a central part of the University's identity, ought to be made readily available to its nontraditional undergraduates. There are certainly logistical issues involved in such achange, first and foremost the need to dramatically increase the number of available sections. Likewise, the two schools would need to decide whether GS and CC students should be able to participate in the same seminars, given that the Core may have different meaning to students at different points in their lives. Consolidating the schools' admissions processes could also present significant complications. Any such lystem would have po recognize that there are major differences in the life'■experiences of the two groups. It would not be sensible to compare the application of a student with previous work and college experience against a student still taking SATs and AP tests. But in considering both demographics separately, it would be essential for admissions officers to avoid skewing the population too far toward either side. The composition of a combined student body should maintain a proportion of traditional to non-traditional students relatively consistent with the current ratio, such that the missions of the two schools are kept intact. Students often complain about the sprawling nature of Columbia's administration, and combining CC and GS would likely combat such decentralization while cutting operational costs. Still, the merger should not be viewed as merely an opportunity increase efficiency, but as a chance to address administrative inequities between the two schools and ensure that Columbia's undergraduates—traditional or otherwise—have comparable access to a world-class education."
449,Reform Effort Pre-Dated Strike Major Cultures Still Evolving As Class Sizes Are Scrutinized,5 December 2007,
450,Cultural Revolution the arts initiative's great leap forward,31 January 2008,"the arts initiative's great leap forwardby Daryl KingPHOTO BY DANIEL YEOWWHEN ASKED WHAT SHE THOUGHT of the Arts Initiative at Columbia, Carling Bateman, BC 'lO, replied blankly, ""What initiative?"" The Arts Initiative, launched in 2004, was an effort to fulfill President Lee Bollinger's wish to expand and develop the way Columbia takes advantage of the city. It is a vast communication network of almost 150 groups, departments, and programs on campus, including most of the major student publications and cultural groups. Yet students like Bateman prove that the Arts Initiative has yet to actively engage many Columbia students. In its latest move to raise its campus profile, the Arts Initiative has launched the Ticket and Information Center in conjunction with the Office of the Provost. The center is a place to buy tickets for both on-campus and off-cam-pus events, not exclusive to the arts, and to fmd information about what the Arts Initiative offers in general. According to Director Gregory Mosher's annual report issued last spring, Havel at Columbia was the supposed solution to the ArtInitiative's lack of presence. Caralyn Spector, program manager of the Arts Initiative, believes that the Havel program increased the initiative's campus presence. ""In terms of programming, the Havel residency was incredibly impactful,"" she said.For seven weeks, Vaclav Havel, the former and first president of the Czech Republic, held a residency at Columbia that featured joint ventures with the Museum of Modern Art, the Apollo, and other major cultural institutions in the city. According to the annual report, the one undertaking that had the most impact on the lives of Columbia students was the inclusion of Havel's masterpiece, The Garden Party, in the Literature Humanities curriculum with attendance required at the dramaticreading of the play. The former president held his residency from Oct. 26 to Dec. 17. Mike Molina, CC 'lO, did not connect personally with Havel's hit and run residency and The Garden Party in particular. ""I wish that there had been more of an introduction. No one knew who he was; he was only here for a little bit, and then he was gone. It was a weird thing to place on freshmen. He was awesome, and I enjoyed The Garden Party. But the majority of people didn't take advantage of the time that he was here,"" Molina said. Aside from Havel, Spector believes that the CU Arts Web site is one of the initiative's successes. ""The Web site acts as a portal for students,"" she said. There students can see listings of both part-time and full-time jobs at some of the art world's leading companies such as BAM, the Weill Music Institute, Ars Nova, the Metropolitan Opera House, and the Guggenheim Museum. In addition, The CU Arts Web site also features the $2O or Less: Student No Rush Program, where students can find reasonably priced tickets to off-Broadway theater, dance, and opera performances in New York City. Soo Han, CC 'O9, however, had trouble getting tickets to a show through the Web site. ""It is not very clear when tickets are available. One time, I tried to sign up two months before, and it was all sold out,"" Han said. One student worker at the ticket center, Ben Klein, School of the Arts, echoed Han's hesitation toward the CU Arts Web site and believes that the ticket center could better address students' needs. ""It has a much greater value than the Web site because it is a tangible place to go,"" Klein said. Another ticket center worker, Nikita Espangel, SEAS 'OB, saw the popularity of the center right away, saying that many peoplehad already bought tickets just hours after its opening and that the booth had received considerable attention from passersby. Spector wants the Ticket and Information Center to be a ""one-stop shop for the entire community."" And while she hopes ""it will help build a stronger community,"" she is not hesitant to admit the initiative is ""always a work in progress."" Ashley James contributed to this article,""IT HAS A MUCH GREATER VALUE THAN THE WEB SITE BECAUSE IT IS A TANGIBLE PLACE TO GO."""
451,The Right Way To Write,1 February 2008,"Sometimes it seems like coming home from college is one big test of how many times you can answer the questions, ""How is school?"" and, ""Do you LOVE New York?"" without exploding. It comes when you least expect it—from that annoying sophomore you bump into at the mall, your least favorite aunt, or your parents who ask you every night at dinner. Over winter break, I was starting to forget that there are inquiries besides this one. And then, in between these priceless questions being hurled at me from every direction, my favorite high school teacher asked me, ""So, what have you learned?"" Finally, a real question. I knew that ""what I had learned,"" in the simplest of terms, was not as broad and worldly as what my high-school self had hoped it would be, but it was also not quite as mundane as who the great Greek writers were. No, ""what I had learned"" was somewhere in between. And as my mind jumped from class to class, one pattern emerged: this semester, I learned how to write. I wrote about 14 papers, totaling somewhere in the range of a 100 pages. That's a lot, I thought to myself, as I smiled and patted myself on the back. Happy as this sentiment made me, my mind wouldn't allow it to prevail for long. Yes, I wrote a lot. And yes, there was a good deal of learning that went into this. However, as I look back on those 100 or so pages, while still managing to get a massive amount of sleep, I realize one thing about the proliferate amount of writing I was expected to do. At the moments when it sounds the best to me and is receiving its highest grades, it is, well, bullshit. You know the kind—a sequence of five questions in a row which I could never actually answer, but which somehow sound more scholarly than actually taking a rudimentary but fundamental stab at them, is what gets an ""interesting!"" from a professor. An introduction which draws on some personal narrative barely related to my paper is mentioned in comments as a ""really strong lead-in."" This is the opposite reaction that most of my legitimate writing gets: on one paper that I was particularly proud of for lacking in bullshit, I received a paragraph-long explanation of how my opening sentence should have used the phrase ""un-countable"" instead of ""countless. ' Yeah—l'm serious. It seems professors prefer to read bullshit just as much as I prefer to write it. In the late night hours before the Literature Humanities Final, I had to write my entire ""Retrospective Essay"" for University Writing. I was sick of everything on Earth at that point, so I decided to actually bullshit a paragraph about how I had bullshitted all the writing in the entire course. No surprise—my professor loved it. While I was disheartened by the realization that the writing I was least proud of led to the most success here at Columbia, my new analytical skills gleaned from Lit Hum discussions shed new light on the situation. If learning bullshit is the key to success at Columbia, it is probably also pretty important out there in the real world,"" and therefore a pivotal skill to learn and have. In other words, if everyone around me is bullshitting and being commended for doing so, maybe bullshitting is in fact the modern-day equivalent of supreme analytical writing. It seems that if we as a society accept this bullshit-type writing as the ideal, then we are in fact taking away the connotations of the words ""bullshitting"" and using ""bullshitting"" to describe the way one should write. It seems as though the former ideal for writing is becoming obsolete. It's being replaced by writing which is neither deep nor necessarily true, but which gives the appearance of being both. This is, after all, the way much of society functions—America is about appearances. Being ""hip,"" ""now,"" or ""trendy"" is not (don't even try to argue) about some state of mind—it is about an outward appearance. Is it so much of a stretch to think that what we think of as ""the best"" writing is beginning to mimic this cultural value? And if so, isn't learning to write in this way not only a good thing to do, but the most important thing we will learn to do during our time at Columbia? So here's what Isay —the next time you sit down to write a paper, go for what seems like the shallow approach—splice up your quotes to make them Fit, use the biggest words, throw trying to understand your subject matter out the window. Instead, concentrate on just sounding smart. When you turn this paper in (and get an A-plus, no doubt), don't feel bad about robbing yourself of the opportunity for some sort of academic enlightenment. Take a deep breath and allow yourself to accept that what you did was more important —you forcibly taught yourself the skill of tomorrow, and in the long run, this is going to serve you a lot better than knowing about some Google-able subject like global warming, international politics, or nanotechnology.

452,Longing for the Core Curriculum,21 February 2008,"BY NANCY SAUNDERSLiterature Humanities is at the heart of the Core Curriculum, at least for Columbia College. I often wonder if I should have taken Lit Hum upon arrival at Columbia. After all, Columbia College students have to take Lit Hum in their first year while General Studies students do not. Isn't it natural to think I am missing out? Is the flexibility in the GS Core in the best interest of its students? If Columbia CoUege sees Lit Hum not only as important enough to be in its Core, but fundamental enough to be placed in the first year, are GS students lacking an important piece of a Columbia undergraduate education? GS students come from a variety of educational backgrounds. Some already come with degrees from accredited institutions of higher learning, and some are transferring with up to 60 credits. As such, our Core is tailored with a bit more flexibility for those individuals who may have taken an identical or highly similar course elsewhere. Moreover, I understand that many of our students have already been exposed to a variety of information including the ""great works"" of Lit Hum and don't want to waste their time sitting through a patronizing reiteration of something they already know. For these reasons, there is more flexibility in our Core, and that's appreciated. It also seems to include an underlying assumption that we, being more seasoned, are best able to make our own academic decisions. And while I'm grateful for the vote of confidence, I do believe that the absence of Lit Hum (and Contemporary Civilizations) in the GS Core results in a failure to recognizethe impact that these courses, and the discussions which surround them, have on the greater Columbia experience. According to'the Columbia College Core Curriculum Web site: ""though celebrated for their content, [the Core] courses are equally important for their small class format. Taught in seminars limited to approximately 22 students, these courses ensure that education at Columbia begins with an emphasis on active intellectual engagement. In the Core Curriculum the pursuit of better questions is every bit as important as the pursuit of better answers."" The depth to which works are discussed with peers develops each students analytical skills. Moreover, it familiarizes them with works that will later be taken for granted as common knowledge. As the majority of students seeking a liberal arts degree from Columbia University nave taken Lit Hum, any professor may take for granted that their class is intimately familiar with that set of works. This could place a GS student who has not been exposed to those works at a disadvantage. Indeed, many contemporary works reflect back on earlier ones, and it would be reasonable for a professor to expect students to realize when and how this is done. In this way, some GS students may not even realize that they lack some fundamental piece of the puzzle. Considering the diversity of backgrounds in the GS community, it is also important to keep in mind that many have very few, if any, transfer credits upon arrival, and may not have had such close contact with Lit-Hum-like texts. These students, under the GS umbrella, are allowed the same flexibility. This can result in a lack of structure and academic stability.So, the question follows—as aGS student, should I have been forced to take Lit Hum at the possible expense of another literature course I might be more interested in? I believe so. In fact, I feel that we should take Lit Hum and another literature course of our choosing. The salient difference, to me, between Lit Hum and the other literature courses that fill our existing requirement lies in the course structures. The structure of Lit Hum —small, discussion-based classes in which entire works are covered—develops students' abilities to analyze. Indeed, it offers them a lens for doing so. Which is why, I believe, it has been included in the Columbia College Core and should be included in the GS Core. Other literature courses at Columbia offer valuable material to be analyzed, often with the assumption that the student has already developed the skills necessary to do so. In other words, it is for two separate reasons that I see both courses as invaluable parts of my educational experience, and as such I do not see them as interchangeable. So, I have come to the conclusion that I should have taken Lit Hum upon arrival at Columbia. I feel that it should be part of our Core so that we will enter other classrooms as well as the ""real world"" with the same academic foundation as our fellow Columbians. The Core Curriculum should lay the foundation for a solid academic experience— a common Core will come to define what it means to be Columbia-educated. And after all, isn't that why we're here? The author is a student in the School of General Studies majoring in political science. She is the vice president of policy for GSSC."
453,THEATER Harold Pinter Revival Tells of Home Sweet Homecoming,4 March 2008,"Harold Pinter Revival Tells of Home Sweet HomecomingBY NIKKI GOLDSTEIN Spectator Senior Staff 'WriterIf there s one thing that Columbia students dont need to be lectured on, it's the value of the awkward silence. Generally speaking, we're pretty good at making awkwardness endearing and cute. Take Bwog personals or class formals, for example. OK, maybe not class formals. But in the newest production of Harold Pinter's The Homecoming , awkwardness is taken to new levels, and the cast behind the show is even better than we are at making it really work. Pinter's play is centered around a traditional nostos —the main character, Teddy, goes back to his London home to visit his family after years of living and working in America. But the play doesn't quite fit into the typical LiteratureHumanities curriculum. When Teddy introduces his alluring wife, Ruth, to his sex-hungry father and brothers, the story begins to spin out of control as the family's dysfunctional nature is taken to wild extremes. This isn't the first time that The Homecoming has graced Broadway, but it may be the first time that it's flipped it upside down. With a star-studded cast including lan McShane, Michael McKean, and Raul Esparza, it's no surprise that The Homecomings 40-year. anniversary production has already extended its limited run. Although the plot technically focuses on Teddy and his return home, his wife Ruth (Eve Best) and nutty brother Lenny (Esparza) offer the two most commanding performances. Esparza finds the perfect blend of sleaze and biting sarcasm to make, his character equal parts hysterical and creepy, very much foiling the nature of the script as a whole and epitomizing Pinter's signature funny-to-a-point aesthetic. His command of Pinter's commonly used silences breathes a brilliantly awkward humor into the script that heightens the strange dynamic of the family as a whole. Best, on the other hand, takes a bit longer to step into the spotlight, often delivering her lines in a high-pitched squeal that's awkward in the not-so-cute kind of way. Only when her character begins to embrace her beauty and sexuality does her physicallanguage begin to command attention in a smoldering way that Barnard and Columbia girls could only dream of. A subtle movement of her legs in Act 2, for example, is meant to provoke the imagination of Teddy's brothers. Their heads explode, and the audience collectively goes gaga —men and women alike. It's a surprise that Esparza and Best steal the show from big-name actors McShane and McKean, whose performances are both chilling and moving. Even more surprising is the casting of James Frain, a Broadway virgin, for the pseudo-lead role (Teddy). Sadly, his performance falls flat against the stellar cast surrounding him, leading one to believe that he may have been cast for the sake of his oh-so-pretty face. The numbness of his character certainly adds to the shock value of the play, but Frain truly fails to find the subtle nuance and balance that Pinter so carefully injects into every one of his characters. It is clear that director Daniel Sullivan and his technical crew have strived to preserve the intent of Pinter's work, shying away from the reinterpretations, script adaptations, and overly artistic re-imaginations that so often characterize revivals. Everyone seems to agree that Pinter really knew what he was doing, and there's no need to question any of his original decisions. Along with this season's acclaimed play, August: Osage County, The Homecoming may bedoing more for the theater than satisfying audiences. For the first time in a long while, straight plays are commanding just as much attention as musicals—if not more —which have traditionally stolen the spotlight on this side of the Atlantic. Riding on the success of last year's Coast of Utopia, these plays are reinvigorating a side ofAmerican theater that has been previously neglected and ignored. All tilings considered, The Homecoming simply shouldn't be missed.

454,"College Offers Mini-Courses for Far-Flung, Nostalgic Alumni",27 March 2008,"BY KATIE DUNN Columbia Daily SpectatorAs Columbia College students reluctandy settle back in from spring break, they might be surprised to hear that their predecessors are eagerly signing up for a chance to revisit the Core Curriculum. The Columbia College Alumni Association launched a program last spring to offer to alumni clusters of classes based on Columbia courses including Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, and Frontiers of Science. Each mini-course is more than simply a Sparknotes- style refresher. Rather than following curricula prescribed by their on-campus colleagues, faculty members work specifically to apply the texts they teach to todays society. According to Executive Director of Alumni Affairs Ken Catandella, one of the programs key organizers, a given class might ""take Hobbes, Voltaire, and Plato, and apply them to the free market economy."" ""The mini-courses try to take the essence of the core and apply it to die reality of the world for alumni,"" Catandella said. Organizers see this approach as an important tool in making courses designed for college freshmen relevant to more seasoned learners. ""Their [alumni's] perspective on life when they read these materials is a little bit different, because they've been out of school and have actually had more real life experience,"" Executive Assistant of Alumni Affairs Mia Gonsalves explained. The program began two years ago, when three brief core reviews were offered at a Columbia College reunion. The enthusiastic response led to the creation of mini-courses last spring. The sessions are currendy offered in New York and Washington, D.C., and an abbreviated, one-class pilot program is being planned for Chicago this spring. More cities may soon follow. Deborah Martinsen, associate dean of Columbia College and lecturer for one such course, attributes the alumni demand for mini-classes to whatshe calls ""Core nostalgia"" and ""Core envy."" The latter, she said, expresses the sentiments of alumni members' friends and spouses, who complain they lack the critical-thinking skills the Core is designed to impart. Currently, the program is open to all CC alumni, who are also free to sign up their spouses and friends. Martinsen noted that her last class included a wide range of ""alumni from the class of 1951 to the class of 2005."" Catandella also proposes another reason for alumni interest in the mini-courses—that they provide intellectual engagement with the academic interests of todays undergraduates. ""They [alumni in the program] feel connected to what the students are doing currendy,"" he said, citing the offering of recent Cote addition Frontiers of Science, which was not available to many of the alumni involved in the program. Unlike those taught in Hamilton, the minicourses are a veritable bargain —$150 for three sessions, which typically include a small meal. In the midst of the Capital Campaign, the major CC fundraising drive launched last fall, organizers said they hope that the program Will also encourage donations. ""This really is a relational activity, although I suspect that happy alums and engaged alums are more likely to be donors,"" Catandella said. ""In that respect, I imagine it's connected. It's not really an outcrop of the campaign."" The often-bimonthly sessions last two hours each and typically occur in the evenings at the volunteered offices of alumni participants. Much like Core classes taught at the University, classes consist of small groups of 20 to 25 alumni. While the classes will not count toward any degree or certificate, Catandella said alumni receive a different sort of compensation. ""When alumni are able to be challenged again by the Cote Curriculum at the place in their lives that they ate today,"" he explained, ""there is a real sense of coming home, intellectually coming home."" news@columbiaspectator. com"
455,SHAKING THE INVISIBLE HAND,27 March 2008,"by Gixen OrbeyJeffrey sachs sustains world interestphotos bv Moll 1 Cpqss nJeffrey Sachs thinks it's about time the study of economics—and the U.S. government, for that matter—gets a makeover. ""I've been trying to suggest that economics itself needs to expand its vision considerably if it's going to be useful,"" he explained when he sat down with The Eye to discuss the ultimately hopeful message of his new book, Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet. Though the book looks to the future, it can also help us deconstruct misconceptions of the past—not just about our approach to sustainable development but about the man behind the term. Sachs' well-received first book, The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time , was called a ""landmark"" by Publishers Weekly and focused on the one billion people left behind by the market forces that make the rest of the world go 'round. The 2005 release featured a foreword by Bono and outlined nine economic and political steps developed by Sachs, in conjunction with Kofi Annan and the United Nations, to help the world's poorest countries out of this ""poverty trap."" In contrast, Common Wealth focuses more on the general issues that profit-driven market forces leave behind—such as the development of sustainable technologies and environmental conservation—and proves once again how startlingly little rich countries such as the U.S. would have to invest to look after the environmental and humanitarian problems that we all share and that the invisible hand can't fix on its own. For those craving a shotgun ride through Africa with Sachs at the wheel, Common Wealth will be a bit of a disappointment. Stylistically, it is more pragmatic than The End of Poverty, bereft of the vivid descriptions of his fieldwork in places like Malawi that illuminated the first book. But what it lacks anecdotally, Common Wealth more than makes up for with unrelenting, eloquent prose that analyzes the U.S.'s current state of affairs—this time without the polite regard for political correctness you might expect from Sachs—and bold, clearly delineated arguments. At 345 pages, 50 fewer than The End of Poverty, it also has a more digestible length. In short, Common Wealth is less Literature Humanities, more Contemporary Civilization. Indeed, it is impossible to read this remarkably comprehensive book without comparing Sachs to the likes of Adam Smith, whom Sachs admires as ""the first champion of economics literature."" The influence of Smith's Wealth of Nations is strongly felt throughout the text. £ £ hat is what literature really means, great literature,"" Sachs says, considering Smith's work. It is 8 a.m. on a Monday, and Sachs' office at the Earth Institute is already buzzing with energy, a belly of activity in the great slumbering beast that is Low Library. To Columbia students, Sachs is more than a professor—from this veritable Fortress of Solitude, he is our superhero-in-residence, an economics nerd with stage presence, just as adept at drawing up financial solutions to the world's problems as he is at fielding questions about whether he keeps a pad of paper and a pen on his nightstand in case he comes up with ""The Answer"" in his sleep (he does). But although it is his key role as a mouthpiece for sustainable development that partners him with celebrities and tends to get more press, he is first and foremost an economist, and as anauthor, the complex and sometimes seemingly contradictory economic problems of our society are what he wants his readers to understand. ""The world is facing enormous ecological and environmental problems,"" he writes in Co?nmon Wealth. ""But running out of natural resources is not the right way to describe the threat."" His book explains, for example, the economics of why the gap between the rich and the poor is growing—even as humanity is getting richer in terms of income per person—in a trend called ""convergence."" Most important, where it goes furthest out on a limb, Common Wealth manages more successfully than other works have to convince the reader that humanity shares a ""common fate on a crowded planet."" In outlining the progress of nations over time, Sachs makes a strong argumentthat we are entering a new global stage of history. He makes it seem not unrealistic that just as certain industrializing nations collapsed in the 19th century, depending on how soon they ""began to understand that they could not simply leave their own poor to wallow in deprivation, disease, and hunger without courting crime, instability, and disease for all,"" we could all fail, together, if we do not mobilize our resources to save each other. The book's signature assertion is that the ""activist philosophy, which holds that the self-organizing forces of a market economy should be guided by over - arching principles of social justice and environmental stewardship, has not yet been extended robustly to a global society."" Common Wealth is a pioneer in making that crucial extension—and in this respect,reading it feels kind of like doing your CC homework, except that the issues are current. They are the defining issues our generation will face, and in that respect you'll know you can do more with what you learn from Common Wealth than impress someone at a cocktail party. Before you read it, though, Sachs wants to clarify something about its title. ""Remember that my main theme here is not redistribution,"" he says. ""In fact, I don't talk too much about rich countries redistributing income to middle-income countries or even to poor countries, I talk about how to invest effectively in the future."" ""I'm not an egalitarian,"" he stresses. ""1 believe we should help the poor. I believe that we don't need to have in our society poor people the way that we do."" On March 11, Zhang Weiqing, China's minister of the State Population and Family Planning Commission, reported to the New York Times that China would not be reversing its one-child policy for at least another decade, ending recent speculation that adjustments would be made in response to the AP-reported ""forced abortions, sterilizations, and dangerously unbalanced sex ratio"" resulting from the legislation. Sachs' attitude toward these claims is that China did what it had to do. ""A tremendous decline in fertility rates was very important for China,"" he says. ""But the whole two chapters [in Common Wealth] on demography emphasize that this kind of fertility reduction can be achieved voluntarily, I believe."" Indeed, of the three parts that compose the middle bulk of Common Wealth— ""Environmental Sustainability,"" ""The Demographic Challenge,"" and ""Prosperity for All,"" characterizing the three problems at hand—the section on demography is the best expounded, the most revolutionary, and will likely be the most interesting to readers already familiar with the sections on the environment and poverty. ""I felt that it was important to lay out the problems, give the scale of the challenge that our generation sees and then talk about how foreign policy, global cooperation, and individual action can address these things,"" Sachs says, referring to the structure of the book. Prescriptive writing is mostly reserved for part five, ""Global Problem Solving."" ""There are hints of solutions along the way, or more than hints,"" he says, recognizing a possible frustration readers might feel. ""But I tried to put all the pieces together towards the end."" After a pause, he laughs, ""I hope people get there."" Even if they don't, the diagnostic middle portions of the book are fundamental. Population control is paramount according to Sachs, but he clarifies that if it is going to be achieved safely and voluntarily, as he maintains, it can only be done through ""a lot of focus and public policy."" ""That's really what I'm advocating everywhere,"" he says. ""That we take this up, stop hiding it. Our government doesn't even talk about it anymore because of its politics, and that is a huge mistake."" He adds, ""This issue needs to come to the fore again."" Though he doesn't express explicit support for any one presidential candidate when he addresses the mistakes of our government in Common Wealth, Sachs' repeated allusions to the successes of John F. Kennedy—in particular his quoting of Kennedy's famous Pace Address at American University in 1963—makes one thing clear: as Americans, we need a paradigm shift. We need ""tobelieve in the very possibility of cooperation with a seemingly implacable enemy,"" and we need a president who will lead the way in this respect, much as Kennedy helped diffuse an impending catastrophe in the U.S.'s relations with the Soviet Union. With the timing of Common Wealth's release, Sachs in a sense capitalizes on his own historical context—after all, in the swing of the presidential primaries, when we have a woman and a black man as two of the leading candidates, can there be a better time to advocate for hopeful change? In a section called ""Six Trends That Will Shape This Century,"" Sachs writes in a confident, almost prophetic tone. The first trend, ""The Age of Convergence,"" highlights the need for effective communication between cultures, which even further necessitates the nomination of the right sort of political leaders. It is ""when markets don't effectively address"" the problems of society, Sachs explains, that we need to explore ""what can be done in terms of public policy."" Unlike Adam Smith, Sachs can do more than write about the changes he thinks our government needs— he can actually affect change in his position as a political advisor, and this is exactly what he does. ""One of the things that I'll strongly recommend to the candidates is a new department for international sustainable development,"" he says. ""It's not enough to have a presidential science advi-sor."" Sachs feels that while in the future candidates should ""certainly have some more knowledge of science and engineering,"" and that ""even some formal training would be helpful,"" he thinks the main solution lies in ""reorganizing our government."" ""I've written a report on that recently, when I was a member of a Congressional commission on our development aid,"" Sachs says. ""I said that we need a whole new department which brings together expertise and which is able to absorb this kind of information, because we don't have that right now."" Just as Common Wealth doesn't hold back on its critique of the government, Sachs in person is blunt. ""I see our government acting blindly,"" he says. ""It has very little sense of other societies and the challenges that they're facing. It can't grapple with problem-solving in the areas of demography and climate change and so on, not only because the will isn't there, but also because the means simply are not there right now."" Sachs is no stranger to finding himself on the receiving end of critique. Though Time has twice named him one of its ""Top 100 Most Influential People,"" and Angelina Jolie probably has one of those ""Jeff Sachs is My Homeboy"" PoverTees in her closet, plenty of sources have voiced opposition to Sachs' methods and beliefs. Tire New York Times literary supplement called The End of Poverty's financial solutions ""single-minded,"" and Sachs' number-one critic is an economist himself—William Easterly of New York University, currently on sabbatical at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Easterly included an extensive critique of Sachsin his 2006 book The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much 111 and So Little Good. In the book, Easterly argues that ""nobody can fully grasp the complexity of the political, social, technological, ecological and economic systems that underlie poverty"" and draws attention to what he calls the ""arrogance that 'we' know how to fix 'them.'"" Most specifically, Easterly argues that ""large-scale crash programs, especially by outsiders, often produce unintended consequences,"" and, citing Sachs' apparent dearth of strategies for accountability, claims that often ""simple dreams at the top run afoul of insufficient knowledge of the complex realities at the bottom."" In a recent e-mail responding to The Eye's question about which issues he hoped Sachs' new book would resolve, Easterly writes: ""I read the new book. I was disappointed that Sachs seems to be moving even further away from common sense and good economics."" While he felt that Sachs' 2005 solution to poverty was ""an ineffective plan by the ineffective U.N., and lots of money [was] spent without anyone being held accountable,"" Easterly writes that with Common Wealth, Sachs ""applies the same approach to all the world's remaining problems ... while he restates unchanged his failed approach to global poverty."" When it comes to the issue of accountability, responses to various aspects of Sachs' Millennium Villages project have swung back and forth like an ugly game of snap. In the January issue of Scientific American magazine, right below Sachs' running column .titled ""Sustainable Developments,"" an editorial by a young aid worker named Eva Kaplan argued for more accountability in the campaign to supply bed nets to combat malaria in sub-Saha-ran Africa, claiming, ""There is anecdotal evidence that some people have employed the nets as wedding veils or fishing aids."" Meanwhile, Mark Grabowsky's Feb. 28 cover story in the journal Nature provided data that supports the Millennium Villages project, saying that the ""new tools and strategies made possible by the substantial increase in resources over the past ten years"" mean ""hope is arriving in Africa."" In response to Kaplan's piece, Sachs says that ""the article was all wrong in my view, and seriously deficient in information. The fact of the matter is we're on the verge of a tremendous breakthrough in malaria control. It's already showing up in many places and it's exactly based on the kind of approach that I've been advocating for nearly a decade now."" Sachs speaks of the campaign against malaria with a giddiness that reveals how much the project means to him. ""It's going to be scaled up even faster now, and it's going to be hugely successful,"" he says. Easterly is correct in suggesting that Sachs fol - lows a similar path in Common Wealth to the one in his first book. But the criticisms that paint Sachs as a sort of indiscriminate benefactor or denigrate his primarily financial approach to global problems seem to miss a key point. It is important to remember that, appearances and celebrity endorsements aside, Sachs is not a superhero after all—he is an economist, and we should ask ourselves to what extent we can expect him to come up with the plans to finance solutions, implement them, and then also analyze the plans himself. Furthermore, his primarily financial approach to global problems can be"

They might exclaim that their favorite interactive hobby just has no place in their pursuits as aspiring academics, business people, and financial analysts. What those students would fail to' realize, though, is that video games can actually be a very productive means of expediting their intellectual, academic, and career pursuits. While that may sound strange, the fact of the matter is that you need some way todecompress mid-study session so that your intellectually saturated cranium doesn't spring a major leak. Video games are a great way to wind down while soaking up some useful intellectual and artistic tidbits of the potentially exam-salvaging nature. Either that, or they will just provide an amusing distraction without even forcing you to get off of the couch on which you've been carefully studying Foucault for the past 10 days. So take a break and try out some of these academically inclined games —sorted below by pertinence of subject area—during your finals crunch, and I promise that you'll be less stressed and will still eventually get into Harvard Law. Exam: Art Humanities Final. Study Solution: Okami for Wii and PS2 — Capcom's Zelda-esque adventure masterpiecestats an ancient Japanese wolf-god and is saturated with beautifully imaginative environments and a stunning watercolor visual style that truly makes it one of the most aesthetically artistic games ever released. Okami is perfect, in other words, for developing your artistic sensibility and honing your ability to ""appreciate"" less awesome artworks by old dead white men for your Art Hum exam. Exam: Economics Final. Study Solution: Bioshock for Xbox 360 and PC —A daunting mixture of free-market analyses, supply-and-demand diagrams, and federal banking networks getting you down? Bioshock's sophisticated story line, rife with political and economic commentary, will surely help prepare you for the exam and help you do better than the inevitable class average of 32. The lastboss fight even pits you against an evil capitalist entrepreneur wbo is enslaving and oppressing thousands of young minds in an attempt to further his own personal power trip (i.e. it will be very similar to your Econ final). Exam: Calc 111 Final. Study Solution: Professor Layton and the Curious Village for Nintendo DS— Professor Layton will prep you for your tough-as-balls Calc 111 final by challenging you with a series of simple geometric puzzles! Or, at the very least, the game's mixture of adventure and mind-stimulating math problems will get your brain cells humming in preparation for your professor's nasty essay question about gammavariable derivative tangential equations. You can even download additional challenges off the Internet for those of you who get somekind of sick pleasure from the perpetual use of your brains. Exam: Literature Humanities Final. Study Solution: Mass Effect for Xbox 360 —The reason I recommend this storyfocused sci-fi shooter as preparation for your Lit Hum final is threefold: 1) you can woo a lover by the end of the game, so it's a little bit like Pride and Prejudice , 2) you get to slaughter lots of big, burly bad guys, so it mirrors the Iliads plot pretty closely, and 3) you can custom name the main character ""Plato and thus make the game instantly relevant in terms of remembering what the hell the Symposium and the Apolopi were about. Add in the fact that the games choose-your-own-path structure isincredibly fun and expansive, and you have a game that should absolutely be incorporated into your literary study Exam: Any kind of Oral Final Exam. Study Solution: Rock Band for Xbox 360, PS3, and PS2— Rock Bandwill substantially improve your ability to verbally fabricate complete bullshit on the spot by forcing you to recite the lyrics to classic rock songs into your television screen over and over again. Sound strange? When you realize that you'll be singing songs like ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" by Jet and ""Gimme Shelter"" by the Rolling Stones, you'll understand more clearly why memorizing the wordsto these songs would be of immense value in improvising during your Women's Studies 101, Third World Poverty, and Social Injustices oral finals.

457,Jason Resnikoff,21 May 2008,"Columbia College Jason Resnikoff's mother watched proudly as her son got stabbed in the back by a vicious murderer. But she wasn't upset —Resnikoff was playing the Duke of Clarence in a student production of Shakespeare's Richard 111. Ever since high school, the Columbia College student has been passionate about Shakespeare. To him, Shakespeare is ""something essential, something good for the soul —not just an extracurricular activity or a pastime."" When Resnikoff auditioned as a first-year for a part in King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe's production of Macbeth, he did not get it. Instead, he pursued Jiis interest in. theater by becoming involved in Barnard's theater department and in student theater groups such as LateNite Theatre and Chowdah sketch comedy. The summer before his sophomore year, he worked on perfecting his favorite monologue from King Lear. He did not simply memorize thettexast —as Resnikoff explained, he ""learned it by heart so that the words bubbled out"" of him with a certain ""emotional rhytlim.""At his next audition, he got the part of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, which set him on the path toward what he described as a ""rewarding and meaningful"" theater experience at Columbia. Since then, he has been cast—mostly in the part of the sympathetic villain —in many Shakespeare productions, playing the Duke of Clarence in Richard 111, Don John in Much Ado About Nothing, and Hubert in King John. Last semester, he was cast as King Lear in KCST's production of King Lear. This was Resnikoff's most challenging part yet in his theater life, as the play itself was difficult to understand. According to him, the meaning in Shakespeare's work evolved in his mind similar to the way Michelangelo ""released"" Iris sculptures from the marble. ""It was a revelation—l finally got it,"" he said. ""This guy's touching on truth."" Aside from what he calls the ""visceral and intellectual satisfaction"" of theater, Resnikoff has also developed an academic interest in history. His thesis on the history of the Second World Warhas gained him two honors, the Garrett Mattingly Prize in History and the Chanler Historical Prize. Writing about history requires persuasiveness, according to Resnikoff, who described it as ""like being a lawyer of the past."" Through classes such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Reskinoff has developed his critical-thinkingabilities and an appreciation for reading. His interactions with ""inspiring"" professors, such as history professor Barbara J. Fields, whom he regards as a mentor, have contributed to his development. ""Senior year in high school, 1 wouldn't have been able to recognize myself today,"" he said. ""My education here has liberated me."" —Zeynep Memearn"

459,Global Core: A First Step Toward Change?,9 September 2008,"BY SCOTT LEVI Spectator Staff WriterIt's understandable if you had to read the official announcement ushering in the new ""Global Core"" a few times before you could figure out what it meant. The newest tweak to the Columbia College Core Curriculum does not seem to depart much from the existing Major Cultures, though its proponents say that it is just the first step of a holistic makeover for the controversial Core requirement. The Global Core was unveiled in mid-August after years of discussion about what to do with Major Cultures, a relatively recent addition to the Core. Major Cultures was intended to offset the largely European curriculum offered in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, but has been criticized for being superficial. The critiques of Major Cultures came to a head during last fall's hunger strike, when protestors demanded that the University reform the requirement. As part of a settlement ending the hunger strike, Columbia comrn itted to converting Major Cultures classes to seminars. What the Global Core amounts to thus far is a consolidation of Major Cultures courses into one list. The Global Core will apply only to the class of 2012 and its successors, though continuing students can elect to pursue it in lieu of Major Cultures. Administrators of the Core say that it lays the groundwork for further reforms and has been a long time coming. ""The changes to the [Major Cultures] requirement —and really, the beginning of more formal discussions about the requirement — are the result of two years' work discussing the requirement with faculty and students,"" said Patricia Grieve, chair of the Committee on the Core and a professor of Spanish and comparative literature.Professors didn't keep quiet about their opinions of Major Cultures, either. ""From the very beginning, concerns expressed by faculty had to do with die structure and teaching of the courses,"" said Kathryn Yatrakis, dean of academic affairs at Columbia College. ""When the Global Core was approved ... it was clear they were so eager to start having a place in the curriculum."" ""The classes had no connection to one another and ranged from simple historical overviews to language classes,"" agreed Jes-sica-Becker, CC 10 and a student representative on the Committee on the Core. In an effort to resolve this disunity, the Global Core will shift to a single compilation of courses grouped by the department they come from rather than the breadth of material they cover. The language used in naming the Global Core reflects what many view as the increasing importance of global forces in shaping perceptions of culture. ""Comparative and interconnectedness are words we use a lot when talking about the Global Core,"" Grieve said, referring to the theme of integration the committee intends to make the epitome of the program. To communicate those messages in a uniform way, the average class may ultimately become a seminar. ""A seminar fosters conversation, allowing students to develop a more thematic understanding of the chosen cultures,"" Becker said. But that kind of structure still seems a long way away for the new requirement. ""That will take just a litde bit of time,"" said Yatrakis, who was unable to estimate exactly when the courses would become seminars. ""It has to do with expanding resources—space and faculty. If you're designing a course that is four 20-person seminars, more classrooms will be needed than for an 80-person lecture."" scott. levi @columbiaspectator. com"
460,DIGITAL MANIPULATION,9 October 2008,"by Anna FeuerIs the Internet changing our experience of the Core?cover photo bp Andra Mihalireading homer in the digital ageby Anna FeuerThe most technologically efficient machine that man has ever invented is the book. —Northrop Frye t's an experience with which every Columbia student is familiar. I'm online, on Course Works, skimming a PDF of an essay by Epicurus for my Contemporary Civilization class. Sitting in the sun on the Low Library steps, I've got my laptop balanced on my knees and music playing softly through my iPod earbuds. On the screen, two or three Internet tabs compete for my attention. After a few paragraphs of Epicurus, I succumb: I open Facebook and begin chatting, promising myself that I'll turn back to mv CC homework in just 10 minutes.Contrast that scene with old black-and-white photographs of Literature Humanities classes from the 19505. Blurry and water-stained, one photograph depicts 18-year-old boys, some with hands raised, seated around a seminar table headed by an animated professor. Fifty years later, the Core Curriculum has seen several changes—most significant is the inclusion of women and minorities in the previously WASP-dominated courses. But there's another difference to be noted: Colum 7 bia students in the 1950s wrote their essays with paper and ink and took notes in the margins of their books. Many of today's students aren't taking notes by hand but typing them into MacBooks. White earbuds peek out of every student's bag—one even spots a Kindle here and there. These objects signify a change in academics—a revolution, in fact—that cannot be overlooked. Established in 1919, the Core represents an incredible continuity of academic thought—that Homer speaks to me in the same way that he spoke to pre-World War II Lit Hum students attests to the timeless universality of the Great Books. But one of the Core's most considerable pressures has been the arrival of a digital culture in which all current students are wholly—and somewhat unconsciously -absorbed. Do today's students, most of whom spend more time with their iPhones or Blackßerries than with pen and paper in hand, read The Republic in the same way that Columbia sophomores did 50 years ago? Given the neurological and psychological changes brought about by the Internet, the Core takes on new significance for those who were taught to type before they learned to write cursive. I'm not thinking the way I used to think,"" wrote Nicholas Carr in The Atlantic's July/August 'cover story. ""I can feel it most strongly when I'm reading. Immersing myself in a book or lengthy article used to be easy. ... Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages.""Carr's article, titled ""Is Google Making Us Stupid?"" was one of many published this past summer that addressed the effects of digital media on reading comprehension and attention span. Of course, there have been dramatic changes in our reading material—we've all spent countless hours procrastinating by reading blogs, not to mention MySpace, Facebook, and Web sites like Fan Fiction.net. But recently, scientists have wondered if Internet culture has spurred internal changes as well.Neurological research shows that a brain raised on gigabytes and pixels may function differently than a brain used to paper and ink. In 2007's Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain, Tufts University neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf emphasizes that ""human beings were never born to read""—that is, we have no genes specifically allotted to enable reading. A child's brain must synthesize the more basic neurological structures for vision and language in order to grasp the meaning of a printed word. Consequently, the development of the written word profoundly expanded the human capacity for deep thought. Wolf writes, ""As literacy became widespread in a culture, the act of reading silently invited each reader to go beyond the text; in doing so, it further propelled the intellectual development of the individual reader and the culture."" As reading necessitates more complicated brain circuitry, it also enables us to think more complicated thoughts. The medium through which we process text determines the wiring of our bra""in circuitry. Forexample, those who learn to read ideograms, such as Chinese characters, develop very different synaptic patterns from those who learn to read alphabets. ""We are not only what we read,"" Wolf says, ""we are how we read."" What happens, then, when our writing systems become computer-generated? As of now, cognitive scientists have only speculated about the neurological effects of URL syntax. However, Wolf worries that the fast-paced nature of the Internet will undermine the kind of deeper thought that reading enables. ""Will the split-second immediacy of information gained from a search engine and the sheer volume of what is available derail the slower, more deliberative processes that deepen our understanding of complex concepts, of another's inner thought processes, and of our own consciousness?"" Wolf asks. Once the brain experiences the instant gratification allowed by search engines and other online information storehouses, will the brain cease to engage in more meditative and intricate thought? By contrast, some researchers argue that online reading generates more complex neurological pathways and thus enhances our ability to analyze and integrate information. Joy Hirsch. neuroscience professor and director of the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory at Columbia University, argues that the Internet is well-suited to the human brain. ""When in digital reading mode,"" Hirsch says, ""the brain processes huge amounts of multimedia information in a more high-level, integrative fashion. The brain is an informationgathering system. The Internet exercises the brain."" She writes off Wolf's concerns about the negative effects of digital media: ""The more global nature of the Internet enables us to integrate disparate topics. High-level integration is what humans do best. The Internet is one of the best things that's happened to the brain in decades."" But science aside, critics also worry that the experience of reading—the curling up on the couch, lost-in-a-good-book kind of experience—is in jeopardy. Now, instead of reading To the Lighthouse with their roommates in a Butler Library alcove or while lounging on a blanket in Central Park, students discover Woolf by the glowing light of their computer screens. We've all crawled under the covers with Woolf or Dostoevsky or even just a Cosmo magazine, reading late into the night by lamplight. It's an entirely solitary activity: we turn each page at our leisure, excitedly opening the book again when we crave another hour or two of time alone. I don't find online reading to be the same experience, not with multiple tabs open and Facebook beckoning me from my favorites bar. Lee Siegel, author of Against the Machine: Being Human in the Age of the Electronic Mob, distinguishes between reading a book and reading online in a National Public Radio interview: ""The great thing about a book is that you're allowed to be passive. ... You're learning how to be alone with yourself. But when you're reading on a screen, there's always the potential for interactive engagement with the text. You're thrust again into the transactional world of everyday life."" There is a difference, Siegel affirms, between the information one finds on Google and the knowledge extracted from a good book."
461,Students Leave Campus to Pursue Dating Scene,22 October 2008,"BY CLAIRE STERN Columbia Daily SpectatorHannah Cain had just settled into her new lifestyle at Barnard when she met Mario Weddell at a party one evening in October, in a typical New York fashion. The two college freshmen hit it off right away. ""It was love at first sight,"" Cain said. But unlike the typical campus couple, the two aren't likely to cross paths on the steps of Low Library. Weddell attends Fordham. On a campus where the dating scene has consistently received dismal scores from insider college guides, it is not uncommon to find Columbians picking from a pool of thousands of Manhattan's eligible mates. For Cain and Weddell, the benefits of having individual space are complemented by frequent visits to each others' neighborhoods. Cain said she visits Weddell anywhere from three to five times a week, especially on the weekends. ""The train ride itself is only 12 minutes, so it's not that bad. It ends up working out half and half—l'll go to Fordham and he'll come up here."" Student opinions reveal that this trend—which is not necessarily a new thing—could stem from the common frustration of leaving a bar or on-campus party, or for some, Butler Library, without a few new phone numbers.Elliot Smalling, CC 'll, said that he makes a regular effort to head downtown to hangouts that lack any connection to Columbia. ""Its difficult because I feel like the Columbia dating scene is not as varied as I would like it to be,"" Smalling said. ""So it's not necessarily that I'm attracted to older men, but if you're not going to leave Columbia that's what you have to choose from."" But for many, this is not without its fair share of problems. For instance, Smalling feels that he's perceived as immature because he's not living in his own apartment. ""It's hard to find common ground with someone with such a completely different lifestyle,"" he said. And maintaining a relationship with someone who lives a hundred blocks away can be difficult. ""As time goes on you get more comfortable and the relationship evolves,"" said Frank Nestor, CC 'lO and a member of the Columbia Swing Dance Club who met his lady friend when dancing downtown. ""But what [the relationship] evolves into might be the problem."" Nestor explained that the logistics of playing the wider field can be challenging. Since his girlfriend attends the School of American Ballet, the only time the two spoke before they were officially dating was on the dance floor on Thursday nights.""There is a certain convenience to someone being a dorm away,"" he said. It appears that female students are more active in their off-campus pursuits. Club promoter Mike Kanevsky said that in his job, he often encounters girls dating older men who live in the city. ""The one thing I've seen is that girls that go to clubs have fake IDs and get in underage,"" Kanevsky said. ""So rich guys tend to date younger girls that go to Columbia or Barnard."" Lara Avsar, BC 'll, stays away from Columbia men, she said, preferring ""older, more mature guys"" and calling it a ""major advantage"" if they do not attend the University. ""It is kind of known on campus that not all Columbia guys are the most datable,"" she said with a chuckle. Nestor suggested an added benefit of separation. Now, he realizes that the distance —though not nearly as large as the hundreds of miles dividing some students from their romantic engagements —has made him more committed. ""The fact that I'm putting in an effort shows thai I really want to see her,"" Nestor said. ""There's a clear level of interest and commitment to the person."" news@columbiaspectator.comMORE THAN A FEW DORMS APART ■ A sizable number of Columbians, frustrated with what they perceive as a limited dating scene on campus, turn to the city for romantic stimulation. Though they differ in their opinions on distance and commitment, they avoid whispering sweet nothings about Literature Humanities to their lovers."
462,The Value of Diversity for International Students,10 November 2008,"BY AMIN GHADIMIFor an international student like me, there is no place like Columbia. Harvard sits atop the U.S. News and World Report rankings, Georgetown has an impressive international relations program, and Oxbridge costs significantly less than 50,000 dollars a year, but none of that really matters. With its pedagogical philosophy and its approach to the concept of education, Columbia offers a truly singular international education. We all know that Columbia values diversity. We experience it for the first time during NSOP week. We see it on College Walk. We hear it in our Core class discussions. We deal with it so much that it may even become banal to us. But it is perhaps only the international student who, because of his or her ostensible foreignness, appreciates how important this diversity is. Internationals are often told about the difficulties of adjusting to a new school and a new country at the same time. Before sending its students abroad, my high school in Japan organized a ""senior transition meeting"" in which it warned seniors of the potential culture shock we would experience in a new country. During NSOP week, I joined my fellow international students in a meeting that exposed us to the different climate of ""the American classroom."" Though certainly helpful, both meetings were superfluous. Columbia's commitment to diversity offers everyone, including me, a comfort zone and a place to feel at home—but not a crevice in which to hide from exposure to different and even conflicting and provocative viewpoints. For me, Columbia's dedication to diversity speaks to my religious identity as a member of the Bahai Faith. On April 12, 1912, Columbia University opened Earl Hall to the Son of the Founder of my religion. He delivered a speech in which he addresseda common element of Columbian philosophy and my faith: he said, ""It is our duty to put forth our greatest efforts and summon our energies from all directions in order that the bonds of unity and accord may be established among mankind."" Columbia demonstrated a commitment to diversity almost a century ago in giving one of the central figures of the Bahai Faith a platform to speak from, and this commitment still resonates; in last year's World Leaders Forum, President Bollinger raised the question of the persecution of Baha'is in Iran in his address to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It is at Columbia that I find my religious beliefs acknowledged and respected. With such a commitment to diversity here, assimilation is not difficult—in fact, there really is no need to assimilate. At the same time, and perhaps more importantly, Columbia's diversity provokes just as it welcomes. Last week, President Bollinger welcomed Sir Salman Rushdie to the inauguration of the Institute of Religion, Culture, and Public Life at Columbia. Last year, to the World Leaders Forum on the same campus, he welcomed President Ahmadinejad, who represents a regime that seeks to put Sir Rushdie to death. Does diversity then become a self-contradiction —can we, for the sake of diversity, paradoxically tolerate those who cannot tolerate diversity? What does this mean for an international student who may bring with him or her ideas and beliefs that conflict with those prevalent at Columbia? How do we reconcile the contradictions diversity engenders? I feel that Columbia seeks to answer these questions —or rather, to force us to answer these questions —in part through the Core Curriculum. Frontiers of Science seeks to train us to think rationally and scientifically, while Art Humanities makes us look at the world from a diametrical perspective. Literature Humanities is steeped in Western culture, while the Global Core seeks to compensate for that. It is asif Columbia's emphasis on diversity of thought and analysis of different points of view is tailored for international students. Columbia teaches us how to synthesize the different cultures and ideas we were exposed to in our upbringing, thereby reconciling them. In this way, I believe that internationals almost viscerally feel the importance of having this exposure to diversity—it speaks to a central part of our identity to think about education as a means of appreciating and solving the question of diversity. It is true that Columbia is, in all its racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural heterogeneity, a microcosm of New York City and of the United States. The diversity we encounter in the city complements and enhances that we experience on campus, while the election of Senator Obama to the Presidency makes any talk of the importance of diversity to the identity of America entirely redundant. But to dismiss Columbia's diversity simply as a reflection of its surrounding culture is to fail to give the University adequate credit. The creation, maintenance, and fostering of the diversity on which we pride ourselves is difficult and controversial, but for the international student especially, that commitment to diversity is invaluable. That Columbia respects diversity but is never afraid to question and challenge it makes it a global leader in international education and the obvious choice for internationals thinking about which college to attend. Any international student can probably attest to being stalked and spammed in high school by admissions officers preaching about how they seek to diversify their campuses—something Columbia has already done and continues to do. This commitment to an international student body is important, for it is from the style of education at Columbia that global solutions to the most pressing global questions emerge.

463,THEATER Graduate Students Take on Chaucer in MFA Initiative Columbia Stages,12 November 2008,"Graduate Students Take on Chaucer in MFA Initiative Columbia StagesBY LOUISA LEVY Columbia Daily SpectatorLiving in New York City, Columbia students are surrounded by an immense world of theater, but some of the most interesting entertainment takes place right outside their doorsteps. Within the Theatre Department in the School of the Arts, third-year Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) graduate students are given complete freedom to push the envelope in their thesis productions. The Canterbury Tales is one of eight graduate thesis productions put on by Columbia Stages, the production arm of the theater department. Six of these shows—including Baal, which ran in October—are the directors' theses, one is the actors' thesis, and one is a collection of one-acts written by graduate playwrights. Until five years ago, these shows were produced without an all-encompassing infrastructure. When Steven Chaikelson became chair of the graduate theater department, though, he created Columbia Stages to solve that problem and, as he put it, ""improve the way we operate."" Columbia Stages also enables the graduate theater program to bridge the gap between the graduate school and the rest of the University. Columbia Stages' shows are now free with a CUID, and the department is making an effort to connect to students in other ways, like staging Lysistrata and Medea for this year's Literature Humanities students, or starting the Talk-Forward Series, which invites Columbia professors to speak about some aspect of each thesis production. According to Chaikelson, ""the primary reason for Columbia Stages' existence is to produce the graduating students' work."" The playwrights' theses give the writers the rare freedom to be elbow-deep in their piece, influencing their show every step of the way. They work closely with a director, often called in from ""the outside world,"" as Chaikelson put it, and work with mentors such as lauded playwrights Edward Albee and Tom Stoppard. Third-year directors also have complete control over their thesis productions. ""In terms of subject matter and other types of things,"" said Chaikelson, ""it's pretty much no-holds-barred."" This year, The Canterbury Tales is the third-year actors' thesis. Like the other thesis productions, this one also explores the boundaries of conventional theater. The actors chose the piece themselves and have played a large role in its development. Director: Yuriy Kordonskiy ""created a safe space in which to explore even the craziest of possibilities,"" actor Amanda Broomell said. Last May, the actors prepared their own improvisations, and the piece grew from there. Though the original sketches didn't ultimately make it into the play, ""it was the beginning ofbiting into this material,"" Kordonskiy said, and it began the process that will culminate with the production that opens tonight. A third-year graduate playwriting student, Ken Kaissar, adapted The Canterbury Tales for the production. Kaissar, whose play Ceasefire was a regional winner in last year's Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival, started working on the project last March. He collaborated closely with Kordonskiy, adapting each tale and producing what Kordonskiy called a ""mountain"" of material that eventually took the form of a journey. ""The journey became a metaphor for life, the journey we are all on, and storytelling became a metaphor for what we all rely on to get through our journey,"" Kaissar said.According to Broomell, Kaissar ""generously and Eiumbly took in our feedback and allowed us to develop each scene based on the discoveries we made during rehearsals."" The difficulty with this sort of rehearsal process is that there is a limited period to make many changes. The script was not solidified until shortly before tech rehearsals. But Broomell said that the challenges of the show ""did bring our class together in that we inspired and fed off each others' ideas."" Collaboration has been key in this production—in addition to acting, the performers sing and play instruments onstage. ""Not only do we get to be a group of actors,"" said Broomell, ""but we also get to be an orchestra of musicians.""The decision to set aside traditional rules of the theater opens up the play to alternative interpretations. ""We created our own world, our own time period,"" Kordonskiy said. The elimination of restraints allows the production to take on the magical quality of the beginning of the rehearsal process when there were no sets, props, or preconceived ideas. As Kordonskiy put it, ""Anything can happen."" The Canterbury Tales runs from Nov. 13-22 at the Riverside Theatre. Tickets are $l5 for the general public, $5 for seniors, andfree with a CUID or other valid student ID. Go to columbiastages.com to learn more about the rest of the season.BOUNDLESS JOURNEY ■ Unrestricted creativity allows MFA graduate students a more organic approach to theater, which gives them a great deal more control over the production as a whole than they would have otherwise. For example, students fill all possible roles of production and performance in a current adaptation of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales."

465,The Classical Language Requirement,22 January 2009,"BY JAKE MILLERWhat was once traditional has now become a radical proposition: that Columbia College students be required to take Latin or ancient Greek, rather than a modern language. Yet there are good reasons for such a requirement: Studying a classical language improves verbal skills and introduces students to other cultures more effectively than studying a modern language. Because of the formalized study of grammar they entail, classical language courses improve verbal and analytical skills in a way that modern language courses do not. Classics majors have higher combined Graduate Record Examination scores than virtually any other students, including modern language majors. Of course, because of the third variable here—the self-selection bias—that statistic is irrelevant. However, it is surely relevant that the combined GRE scores of classics majors showed a drop at about the same time that classics programs began de-emphasizing the languages and teaching more civilization courses. This indicates a relationship between the verbal and analytical skills tested by the GRE and experience in the classical languages. These skills are most likely affected by the close analytical work required by the intensive study of grammar. As a student of French, Latin, and Greek, I can testify to die fact that the level of analytical and grammatical work I do in French is not comparable to the work I do in Latin or Greek Nor could it be—most modern languages have much simpler grammars than Latin or Greek,and in any case, the emphasis in modern language courses is on communication, not on the formal study of grammar. Once the grammars have been mastered, the focus of classical language courses is purely literary. As a result, studying a classical language teaches students more about other cultures. For example, a two-year course in Greek might consist of two semesters of Greek grammar, and then a semester each of reading Plato and Homer. While the student of German is learning how to older a sandwich, his counterpart in Greek is reading the Republic. This more literary approach certainly pays off when it comes to appreciating the cultures of Greece and Rome. Finally, learning a classical language would enrich discussion in both Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Imagine if students could refer to the literary features of the original Greek text of Medea. No language is as represented in Literature Humanities as Greek is, or in CC as Latin is, and even those texts that weren't originally in Greek or Latin often refer extensively to the classical texts to which students would be exposed in their language courses. I realize that the Core is already criticized for its Western focus, and the foreign language requirement could be seen as an opportunity to pursue the study of another culture. However, judging by enrollment numbers, most students are pursuing European languages anyway. Further, it is highly questionable whether one learns much culture in an elementary Arabic course, when the primary focus of the course is linguistic. Finally, there already is a part of the Core devoted to non-Western cultures: the Global Core. If the Global Core is insufficient for that purpose, then that is a problem widi the Global Core. There is no reason to force the language requirement to serve the same purpose. Such a complaint would merely be specious: although it is true that Greek and Roman cultures contributed mightily to the foundauons of Western cultures, their attitudes toward gender, politics, andreligion were strikingly different from those ofWestern cultures of today. They were not even confined physically to the West: Roman lands included parts of North Africa. Indeed, it would be hard to find a modern society more ""foreign"" than either Greece or Rome. America arguably has more in common with modem Japan than with Sparta. ""The study of the classical languages actually exposes students to cultures that are in many ways more different from our own than another modern culture. Some might say that with increased globalization, it is essential that students be able to speak the language of another country. Knowledge of a classical language actually facilitates learning a modern language, more so than a modern language does for another modern language. Because the Latin and Greek grammars are so complex, in order to learn a modern language, it is usually just a question of what to subtract from the Latin or Greek grammar already mastered. Moreover, the level of a modern language attained after two years at Columbia is generally not high enough to permit students to immediately live or work abroad without further instruction in that language. Students who are interested in doing so have to take extra language courses anyway. In addition, utility cannot be the standard by which Core requirements are judged. Almost any discipline could benefit the modern student in some way, but it is unrealistic to include every useful skill in the Core—and as already shown, classical languages are themselves useful to know. I am not suggesting that we add a requirement, but rather modify an existing one to improve it. The study of classical languages has been in decline for a while now. Indeed, very few high schools teach them. College will likely be the only opportunity students ever have to engage with classical languages, whereas modem languages are widely taught even at the middle school level. We should be continuing this educational tradition, not allowing it to die without comment. The author is a Columbia College sophomore."
466,THEATER The Queens Sandbox Everyone's favorite Greek madwoman Medea takes to Columbia Stages this weekend in a production staged in a giant box of sand.,30 January 2009,"The Queens SandboxEveryone's favorite Greek madwoman Medea takes to Columbia Stages this weekend in a production staged in a giant box of sand.BY ITTAI ORR Columbia Daily Spectator""Where happiness begins, it now ends!"" Medea's tortured cry rings loudly, her bare feet sinking into sand. In her graduate directorial thesis, Alicia House (MFA, D-irecriirg) tocrk these words literally. Staged around an enormous sandbox, Euripides' timeless tragedy Medea will be performed by Columbia Stages Friday and Saturday at Riverside Theater. For those of you who slept through Literature Humanities, Medea—a second-class citizen and outsider to Greece—is abandoned by her husband Jason in exchange for a younger princess. Exiled from her land, Medea flies into a terrible rage. ""We women are the most unfortunate creatures!"" she laments, determined to take matters into her own hands. Our support for her wanes as rage plays out in the sandbox. At times Medea's two unfortunate sons run around building sand castles and Jason kicks up sand in anger, but mostlytheir mad mother (played by Jessica Bates) stomps around in it, a child-killer and a child herself. There are moments when the sandbox, however powerful in its associations, upstages the story. Toward the end, Jason (played by Alexis Savino) takes up a tiny plastic shovel from the sandbox and points it angrily at Medea. Whether this was inspired by the actor's blind despair or somehow contrived washard to tell—though either way it read awkwardly. The play's few problems lie not with House's inspired vision, but rather with its execution. Despite this ambiguity, the design of the show remained moving and clear. Together House and first-time set-de-signer Ji-Youn Chang create stirring childhood imagery to accompany the well known story of a woman tired of being a woman.Choosing a play this ancient and wordy can be extremely challenging, but House and her team hold the audience's attention. The ancient becomes relatable with evocative char-acter-object relationships—no doubt inspired by Anne Bogart, head of the MFA directing program. The play is strongest when the chorus takes the stage around Medea, their choreography (by Banaue Miclat) tactile andvisceral, though their singing talent could be used more—so much of the tragedy is too much for just spoken word to hold. The well-tempered nurse portrayed by Janet Prince—a commanding stage presence in her own right—complements Bates' exposed performance as Medea. Her fretting gives voice to our own increasing horror as Medea's thoughts become bloodier. The final electrifying scene opens as the curtains of the gigantic on-stage window reveal the murderess, her bloody hands stretched to heaven. Before her, water begins to pour down from the rafters, forming rivulets on the glass panes. The unconscious is everywhere, as it should be in this primordial tragedy. Who knows what further leaps and bounds House may take from here. Medea is showing at Riverside Theater, located at 91 Claremont Avenue at 120 th Street. It is showing Friday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Tickets are free with student ID or $l5 without.ALL CHILD-KILLER, NO FILLER | Euripides' villainess Medea haunts the stage of Riverside Theater with her impassioned rhetoric and morbid actions in Columbia Stages' newest theatrical production."
467,Extending a Hand Across Cultures,4 February 2009,"BY JOHNNA WUMany times, sitting in John Jay Dining Hall, I look across the room and see clusters of my fellow classmates —friends sitting with friends, eating, laughing, chattering, a group of black students at one table, a group of Indians at another. In calculus, I see my Chinese classmates sitting together in the corner of the room, the dull sound of the chalk moving across the blackboard punctured by their whispers. Columbia emphasizes diversity of the student body as essential to enriching the learning experience. Selecting candidates from a wide range of countries and states, the University hopes to foster interactions among students of different backgrounds. Even though admissions always looks for more ways to increase the existing diversity, many students tend to bond more tightly with others of the same cultural background. I also see that, more than even a common cultural background, it is shared activities and close living quarters that ease the process of forming friendships. But culture clubs that support diversity by promoting the heritage of a certain ethnicity could unwittingly, and ironically, foster cliques through the frequent social interactions among members of the same race within these clubs. People in these clubs naturally identify with others of their heritage because of thecomfort that comes from being with those who can understand one's cultural upbringing. It is only to be expected that some international students will hang out more often with people who hail from the same country or speak the same language as they do. Some of my Asian-American friends, in regretful tones, make the observation that Asians are one of the more ""cliquey"" group on campus. Bur if this perception is true, it would only be natural when one considers that the undergraduate student body is roughly 20 percent Asian, making them the largest racial minority groups at Columbia. Moreover, what constitutes the idea of the Asian ""clique"" itself is blurry. In fact there is much diversity in what one might call an Asian clique, for Chinese, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Japanese often mingle together, even though the cultures of each differ considerably. If Columbia wants to encourage more interaction among people of different ethnic backgrounds, the dorm floor would be a good place to start. Enhancing the diversity on the floor effectively fuses the living experience with a learning one, to use the phrase that is the underlying concept of the Living and Learning Center. On my floor in Furnald, 1 live with people who are Georgian, Romanian, Indian, Chinese, and Armenian. And our interests are as far-ranging as our nationalities, for our intended majors span through economics, biology, physics, music, and international politics. Yet, we have made close friendships by discussing the books we read in Literature Humanities, sharing the music we enjoy, and laughing at the same jokes. We have become such good friends that we all want to block together again next year, realizing that living together in close proximity facilitates the formation of friendships, since, given our exterior differences, we might not have become friends had we not been forced-to dealwith each other on a daily basis. Although the University strives to include a broad range of cultural and racial diversity, much can still be done to achieve more equal geographic representation. It is true that by drawing roughly 15 percent of the student body from other countries, Columbia successfully promotes interactions with international students. However, a disproportionate number of students come from the New York and New Jersey region while the Midwestern and Southern states are underrepresented. Although it is true that not as many students apply from the underrepresented areas, efforts should still be made to include more of them at Columbia in order to build an even greater range of diversity. While we do have a natural tendency to be with people of the same cultural background, we should not limit ourselves in this way, but rather strive to step out of our'comfort zones and initiate more crosscultural interactions. So next time you go to John Jay or walk into that lecture room in Pupin, why not sit next to someone with whom you wouldn't imagine having anything in common? Strike up a conversation. Take that risk. Columbia, like many other educational institutions, seeks to foster many kinds of diversity on campus. Despite the improvements it can make in creating more equal representation across geographic lines, admissions does its best to put together a class of culturally and racially unique students. But we, as the students, must also do our part to cultivate a truly diverse environment. It would be a pity not to take advantage of the fact that we are in the country's most co- politan city with as heterogeneous a group of c .ssmates as one can imagine. Through increased socialization with students of different ethnicities, we can seek to understand a commonality among us that could crystallize into lifelong friendships."
468,Academics Find Lack Of Professional Security,5 February 2009,"BY LIZA WEINGARTEN Spectator Staff WriterWith a narrower range of job possibi lilies throughout the country, graduate and post graduate students are discovering that a Columbia degree or teaching position at the University does not guarantee as much professional security as it once did. Though some institutions have put hiring freezes into effect, the University is utilizing less extreme money-saving methods for the time being. The Arts and Sciences division, which houses Columbia College, has implemented a hiring review board, and has deferred some faculty searches. ""We're not feeling it now at Columbia the same way our colleagues [at pubiic universities] are,"" Nicole Wallack, acting director of the Undergraduate Writing Program, said. The UWP still employs only Columbia graduate students to instruct the first-year University Writing course, and instructors are able to use their compensation to pay off their student bills.A steady salary is not the only reward from holding this position. ""In this current market, to have this as one of things you are able to teach is a plus,"" Wallack said. She expressed her belief that having this credential on a resume can boost a graduate student's desirability as a candidate for a job. At the same time, the UWP's policy is not a good representation of the climate of the professional world, even on campus, outside of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Geoffrey MacAdam, a post graduate in the French Department and a Literature Humanities instructor, had to terminate his two-year contract with the Core Curriculum to take a job in financial consulting. ""Occasionally people could hang around for another year, but what was made clear to me was that I couldn't."" MacAdam said, recalling that there used to be more elasticity in Core instructor's contracts. MacAdamadded that in a different economic situation, he may have been ""a little bit more willing to roll with the dice,"" but certain safety nets —such as adjunct professorships or teaching assistant positions—are no longer as common. For graduate students and post graduates going through what are now secure job searches, this tapering scope means that teaching is going to change, postulated MacAdam, adding that, ""folks [post graduate teachers] like me probably aren't going to be around too much."" ""Now, even for Ph.D.'s who are very open to doing somethingoutside the academy, finding a non-academic job is not a given,"" Richard Kurz and Jennifer Furlong, director and associate director, respectively, of Graduate Student Career Developmentin Columbia's Center for Career Education—wrote in an e-mail. ""It is hard to say whether the current situations in universities and colleges will make fewer people consider academic careers."" Kurz and Furlong reiterated, though, that the economic downturn is not likely to radically affect the'way in which graduate students and postdoctoral fellows go about looking for tenure-track faculty positions.As for the future of the UWP's unique graduate student employment program, the current economic state is no predictor. ""We have no idea about what the future of that [graduate student employment] will be,"" Wallack said. And, for post graduates like MacAdam who cannot realize aspirations of continuing their academic careers now, the future is just as vague. Down the line, in a stronger economy, MacAdam admitted he would be open to teaching as an adjunct professor. ""Once you walk out that door, though, it's hard (o come back,"" MacAdam said. news@columbiaspectator.com"

470,BOOKS Professor's Books Enlighten the Masses,26 February 2009,"Professor's Books Enlighten the MassesBY KAT BALKOSKI Columbia Daily SpectatorImagine a world that considered genetics more on par with astrology than with ""hard science."" Or one in which ambitious SEAS students completed rigorous problem sets on family structure in Amazonian tribes or on religion and castes in South Indian slums. To find out more about such a strange world, you might want to ask Columbia professor, author, and alternate universe enthusiast Jenny Davidson. In her upcoming talk at Book Culture, Davidson will discuss her newest work, Breeding: A Partial History of the Eighteenth Century. Davidson joined Columbia's English and comparative literature department in 2000. After teaching Literature Humanities for a few years, she now focuses more exclusively on the 18th century. She has also published two academic books, two young-adult novels, and is working on a third novel. When asked how she manages to juggle teaching and writing, Davidson said, ""They're deeply complementary, and they really do enrich each other. But anyone who's writing and teaching knows that the hardest thing is finding any time to write."" Just to add to her busy schedule, Davidson is also planning to run the Antarctica Marathon in March. A work of both intellectual history and literary criticism, Breeding focuses on the battle between nature and nurture during the Enlightenment. Davidson was well aware of the difficulties of analyzing such a debate, even on a linguistic level. ""I was drawn to the word 'breeding' as a key word because it seems to work both as a synonym for nature and for nurture,"" she said. More scientifically-oriented terms such as ""heredity,"" ""genetics,"" and ""biology"" were all coined in the 19th century. Davidson is particularly interested in how attitudes toward the threat of determinism have changed. ""For us, the threat of determinism comes very strongly by thinking about genetics,"" she said. Many tend to react negatively to comparing the mental faculties ofvarious racial or gender groups through genetics, and new fears have recently surfaced about the potential for genetic discrimination in employment opportunities and health care coverage. The 18th century is often portrayed as a golden age of egalitarianism and an era built on the principle that all men are created equal. Yet the idea of the ""blank slate"" did not carry with it any real promise of equality. ""It was culture that was felt to be so strong that it was almost—and horrifyingly—inescapable,"" Davidson explained. People might possess the same theoretical potential at birth, but social and cultural realities were essentially inviolable barriers. Davidson's most recent young-adult novel, The Explosionist , has strong thematic ties to Breeding. It tells the story of a teenage girl in an alternate 1930s Edinburgh, where the 19th century took an entirely different course—the Scottish Enlightenment continued to dominate intellectual developments, especially attitudes toward reason and emotion. ""I've always loved young adult books! I just read them very regularly and enthusiastically,"" Davidson said. She admires in particular the works of Diana Wynne Jones, Philip Pullman, and Garth Nix, authors whose books are as rich, complex, and lengthy as adult novels. A few years ago, while perusing the selection at the Bank Street Bookstore, Davidson was unable to discover any newer young adult fiction satisfying her criteria. ""It sort of gradually dawned on me, I guess I mighr have to write it myself,"" she said. The medium of fiction allowed Davidson to explore the implications of Enlightenment philosophy on a more intimate, human level. Her academic work had already led her to wonder about the emotional costs of internalizing an ""ethos of reason."" Writing The Explosionist\ve\ptdi her realize how high these costs might be. Davidson will discuss Breeding: A Partial History of the Eighteenth Century with Vassar College English professor Julie Park at Book Culture on Feb. 25 at 7:30 p.m. The event is free and open to the public."
471,CC enrollment to grow by 50 Harmony Hall now open to undergrads,24 March 2009,"Harmony Hall now open to undergradsBY JOY RESMOVITS Spectator Senior Staff WriterThe Columbia College Class of 2013 will increase by 50 students, in what Kevin Shollenberger, dean of student affairs and associate vice president for undergraduate life, called an effort to ""address our budgetary concerns."" To provide housing for the additional students, some graduate school housing in Harmony Hall on 110 th Street between _ Amsterdam and Broadway will be made available for CC/SEAS students participating in General Selection for housing this year. On Monday night, on the eve of the release of housing lottery numbers to CC/SEAS students, Shollenberger sent students the e-mail announcing the changes. ""College enrollment will be increased only to the level our residential facilities can reasonably support, and we have done extensive planning to ensure that,"" Shollenberger wrote. ""The next first-year class will include 50 more students along with some additional transfer students."" To ease the strain that the larger class will impose on an already cramped campus, ""25 sophomore beds in Furnald will be converted to first-year beds, and an additional residence hall will be included in the undergraduate housing invenr-ot-y-for ail CC/.S-&AS students,"" he wrote. . ■ The changes are coming as the University contemplates how to maintain academic qualitywhile coping with endowment losses, a priority that University President Lee Bollinger has repeatedly emphasized. In a late January e-mail sent to students, Bollinger reyealed that the University's portfolio had declined 15 percent over the sixmonth period ending Dec. 31, 2008. To address a tightening i budget, Bollinger asked each ""budget unit""—such as schools, centers, or offices—to plan for an eight percent decrease in the amount of revenue they receive < from the endowment fund for the next fiscal year. : ""Let there be no doubt, we still have to face hard choices in the months ahead,"" he wrote, adding later, ""Hopefully, by accepting and planning for i this new reality, we will be in < a position to move forward in strength."" In a subsequent inter- i view, Provost Alan Brinkley gave ; further details on the measures ; under consideration, saying that they could include targeted hiring reductions and the delay of i Sakai, the successor Web site to, 1 CourseWorks. Brinkley said the cutbacks would not cause ""irrevocable damage."" Although relatively small, the admissions increase mayrepresent the University's next ""hard choice."" Administrators were unavailable to speak last night after the reception of the e-mail, and Shollenberger's notice left several issues unclear. The e-mail implied that the College is increasing enrollment to raise revenue but did not explain if it could do so while maintaining its commitment to need-blind admissions. ""Columbia is not exempt from the financial challenges current times present, and the University has spent the past several months examining ways to preserve our institutional values while addressing our own budget shortfalls,"" Shollenberger wrote. ""It is with respect for these values and an awareness of our economic realities that Vice President [for Arts and Sciences] Nicholas Dirks has adopted a number of measures to address our budgetary concerns including increasing enrollment for Columbia College."" It is also unknown if or by how much Columbia will raise tuition for the 2009-2010 academic year. Though the most immediate limiting factor for enrollmentincreases is space, several other changes will be required—so extra students would prompt the creation of two to three more sections of certain Core classes such as Literature Humanities. Additional Resident Advisors would also be required to supervise the new dormitory. Shollenberger noted that ""the addition of Harmony's eight floors offers 72 single and six double rooms."" But it is unclear where the law and statistics students who currently live there will be placed. Harmony Hall is located at 544 W. 110 th St. near a synagogue and The School of Columbia, and it opens into a lobby containing chairs and a table.

472,Shirking professorial responsibility,1 April 2009,"BY DOV FRIEDMANWhen The Current hosted professors Mark Lilla, professor of humanities, and Mark Carnes, Ann Whitney Olin professor of history at Barnard, for a panel discussion, the ostensible topic was the Core Curriculum. Campus-wide debate and criticism of the Core are as much a hallmark of a Columbia education as the courses themselves. Yet the discussion between Lilla and Carnes yielded insight into something arguably more interesting than the Core itself: the responsibilities of professors as educators. Carnes explains his development of a new approach to teaching as something like an epiphany. While teaching Contemporary Civilization, he realized that its methodology was misguided. Carnes used Plato's The Republic to explain the flaw in the Socratic method. As the dialogue progresses, Socrates speaks more, while the students speak less. Pedagogically, there is something wrong with the passivity of students. Carnesspent years developing his Reacting to the Past curriculum, which uses elaborate game formats in which students take on roles as historical characters to radically alter the student classroom experience. Lilla's philosophy of teaching, however, seems opposed to Carnes's. Lilla argues that American teenagers come to college less educated than our international peers. It is his responsibility to steep Literature Humanities students in the intellectual tradition. He challenges his class and raises the bar of his expectations. In his model, the professor instructs from a position of knowledge, hoping to instill questioning and understanding in students. Lilla and Carnes have differentpedagogical approaches, yet as educators these men are strikingly similar. The idea that emerged most clearly from their discussion was a mutual passion for teaching and a willingness to go to great lengths to effect intellectual growth in their students. Carnes is leading a movement to incorporate Reacting-style teaching at other colleges. Lilla reads and comments on two-dozen multi-page reading responses for every class. In different ways, these professors provoke a reconsideration of professors' roles at the University. Carnes and Lilla both stressed the energy they have expended in creating a rigorous classroom experience. Both indicated that their efforts were worth the extra work, because the student response speaks for itself. The contrast between Lilla and Carnes on the one hand, and many experienced professors on the other, ispainfully clear. Lilla and Carnes reiterated a common criticism of the University: many academics are chiefly concerned with their research and care little for their teaching responsibilities. Undoubtedly, every Columbia student has felt this way about a professor in the past or will feel this way before he or she dons cap and gown. I have my own experiences. This past semester, I enrolled in a Global Core course with a prominent professor whose reputation as a lecturer was only outdone by his prowess as a writer. His writing captivated me, and when world news intersected with his area of study, I contacted him. I explained that I was looking to better understand the news that the media covered poorly. A simple book recommendation would have sufficed, yet this professor did not even acknowledge the e-mail. Is this how I, as a senior, am to remember Columbia? Is this a reflection of how Columbia wants to be perceived as an institution? When the pursuit of extracurricular education is stymied by professorial neglect, it is true irony: the person who has devoted him or herself to a life pursuing knowledge cares not to help students pursue the same. Columbia promotes the Core to prospective students as an opening of the mind—a chance for the entire college to have a shared intellectual experience that is the subject of passionate discussion on the steps of Low Library. We the students should know: the school was pitched to all of us once upon a time. The luster of this idealistic image—this marketing tool—is tarnished for everyone at some point. One way to conclude would be to propose policy changes in hopes that future students would have a different experience. Fine-tune the tenure process to incorporate professors' abilities to critically engage students. Provide incentives for experienced professors to teach Core courses, especially Lit Hum and CC. Finally, change the culture of this university. Promote a culture in which professors are eager to engage students outside of class and to cultivate their intellectual growth. Columbia is a fragmented, isolated place. Students are not alone in that feeling. When Lilla arrived at the panel, it became clear that in his three years here, he and Carnes had never met, despite both professors' prominence. Policy proposals from an outgoing senior are as valuable as the legislative priorities of a lame-duck president. Thus, the proper conclusion is an appeal to conscience. If the University stands for anything, it is the promotion of intellectual discourse and scholarly knowledge. Columbia has a responsibility to nurture its students' academic growth. Some of the best minds in the world are gathered together here in a startlingly small geographic space. It is time we start treating our intimate space like an intimate community as well.

473,CORE CRISIS,2 April 2009,"by Anna FeuerWhy the humanities' ivory tower may be in danger of crumbling,cover illustration by Matteo Malinvernothe future of Columbia's business modelby Anna Feuer • inside illustrations by Matteo MalinvernoThe ivory tower, often under scrutiny, has wobbled during the current economic crisis. Finally, critics proclaim, smarter-than-thou academics must turn their gazes downward as financial chaos takes hold of their ivy-covered halls. Is the end of the vaunted liberal arts curriculum at hand?The humanities, more than other fields of study, embody elite education's cloistered mentality. And as the recession wears on, they bear the brunt of shrunken endowments. Faced with budget cuts and hiring freezes, top universities have prioritized hard sciences over their philosophy, religion, and anthropology departments. Classics majors find themselves relegated to the bottom shelf. With strained resources and choked budgets, the humanities, while still holdouts for intellectual isolation, have found themselves on shaky ground.With its Core Curriculum—a program emblematic of the traditional liberal arts educationColumbia embraces the life of the mind more than most schools. The Core claims to promote learning for its own sake. As its mission statement notes, the ""enduring habits of mind developed in the Core will leave an indelible mark in the capacity to experience one's own life in a richer and more meaningful way."" The Core ultimately aims to promote students' self-culti-vation. Removed from financialor professional concerns, students may examine and challenge their own perspectives. But the recession has hit higher education hard: Ivy endowments have decreased by as much as 27 percent (Cornell), with Harvard and Yale's each down by 25 percent and Columbia's down by a slightly less drastic 22 percent. Having experienced portfolio losses of 15 percent over the sixmonth period ending Dec. 31, 2008, Columbia has seen an 8 percent decrease in endowment payout, affecting every part of the budget. Cost-cutting measures have included a hiring review board, the postponement of faculty hiring searches, a 10 percent decrease in the number of doctoral students, and a faculty wage freeze. Columbia has made some tough financial decisions, and it seems the choices will only get tougher. In debating which academic programs should carry the burden of the financial crisis, many schools have targeted the humanities. But for a place like Columbia to de-emphasize its liberal arts curriculum would be to sacrifice its fundamental educational philosophy.Wherever you are, and wherever you live in America, you cannot spend a day, you can hardly spend an hour of your life, without paying tribute to Columbia University,"" Upton Sinclair declared in 1923, referring to Columbia's large stake in the business world. In The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education, Sinclair describes how the activities of everyday Americans support the University: ""1 helped to build it up when I telephoned my friends to make X. engagements, for Columbia University"
474,A global guise,9 April 2009,"BY JAKE MILLERLet us presume—let us be uncontroversial—that it is valuable to study foreign cultures, that it is a worthwhile pursuit—for this is the premise that lies behind our Global Core requirement. This goal is ill-served by the present requirement, the wording of which is so vague —so infelicitous—that if it is read closely and taken literally, it reveals a veritable smorgasbord of flaws. What areas are sufficiently ""global"" that their study will fulfill our requirement? Let us turn to the bulletin in search of answers. There we are informed that ""the Global Core requirement consists of courses that examine areas not the primary focus of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization."" Where we wanted guidance, we find only a platitude—for almost every area in the entire world is not the ""primary focus"" of either Lit Hum or CC. What does it even mean to be the ""primary focus"" of Lit Hum or CC? Should we consider Spain an area of primary focus? Or Russia, with only Dostoevsky on the syllabus? What of those areas that are not covered at all—Poland, Canada, Ireland? No one could argue that those areas are the ""primary focus"" of Lit Hum or CC—yet we all know that a course on Irish literature or on Polish cinema would never be approved. But why? On what grounds, considering the text of the requirement, could such courses be disqualified?If we look at the list of approved courses, we will only find a few areas represented— East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and selected African and South Asian countries. Almost no other areas are represented on our list. And how have they arrived at this list? What secret criteria—for their criteria are certainly not evident from the text of the requirement —have they used to select these areas? One must see in this list an implicit ""area hierarchy""; their premise, evidently, is not —as I mistakenly stated above—that it is valuable to study foreign cultures, but rather that it is valuable to study these specific foreign cultures. Why these ones? The bulletin gives us no clue. Perhaps they are concerned that to reveal explicitly this hierarchy—as was the case in the Major Cultures requirement—would smack of illogicality. But it is no less illogical for being hidden—it is merely an illogicality forced underground. There is nothing in the text of the requirement that suggests such a hierarchy—which indisputably exists. I must pass over the other flaws and problems in the text of the requirement, although I would love to know what extent of space or duration of time qualifies as ""expansive"" enough. The list of approved courses provides no clear guidelines—it contains a course on Gandhi's India, a course on the U.S./Mexico border, and a course on popular music of the Caribbean, to name a few—courses which I would consider neither temporally nor spatially expansive. Instead, let us see how virtually any course that does not concern the few areas that can be legitimately considered the primary focus of Lit Hum or CC could fit this requirement.Take a random course from the catalog and test it against the requirement—a course which we all silently know would never be put on the approved list, because we all implicitly acknowledge the existence of the area hierarchy. Let us consider, for example, ""The Russian Short Story."" It passes the first test —Russia is certainly not the primary focus of Lit Hum or CC. The course is ""broadly introductory""—it is a ""survey of the Russian short story tradition""—and since it covers 200 years of Russian literature and involves the world's largest country, no doubt it is temporally and spatially expansive enough. It is ""organized around a set of primary texts"" and it ""focuses on a specific culture."" There is no reason, from the text of the requirement itself, why this course should not be on the list of approved courses. Try this experiment yourself—many courses lend themselves easily to the requirement. I am not objecting to the Global Core because I am Eurocentric, or indeed, for any political reason. I think foreign cultures ought to be studied. I am objecting to this requirement on the grounds that it is illogical, and that it is a monument to political correctness —an outdated view of the world as ""us"" and ""them,"" secretly enshrined in a list of approved courses that could not be independently derived from the text of the requirement itself. If the University wants us to take a course on these specific areas, then that desire should be made explicit—it should not be cloaked in the guise of a ""Global Core"" requirement. No one is deceived. The author is a Columbia College sophomore."
475,Three's the charm in Orestes'patricidal quest BOOKS Carson's translation: This isn't your parents' Aeschylus,10 April 2009,"BOOKSCarson's translation: This isn't your parents' AeschylusBY KAT BALKOSKI Spectator Staff Writer""OTOTOI POPOI DA! Apollo! Oipollo! Woepollo! O!"" Literature Humanities students may have actually enjoyed Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon"" had Cassandra shouted such exciting gibberish in the assigned version of the play. Compare these guttural exclamations of grief with the standard Richmond Lattimore translation: ""Oh shame upon the earth! Apollo, Apollo!"" Anne Carson's An Oresteia (Faber & Faber, March 2009, $27) updates Greek tragedy for a generation raised on Hollywood and Ritalin. The language is clear and contemporary, and the pagination is easy on the eye. Yet the accessibility of her style does not detract from the emotional power of her poetry. An Oresteia was commissioned by the Classic Stage Company in New York, and it is a compilation of Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon,"" Sophocles' ""Elektra,"" and Euripides' ""Orestes."" The play is ongoing at CSC through April 19. Although Aeschylus wrote a complete Oresteia, Carson decided to tell the tale of the House of Atreus using three different authors. The order of the plays and the order of the author's lives are both chronological. This juxtaposition reveals interesting stylistic distinctions that mirror historical transitions in classical Athens. In the hundred years between Aeschylus' and Euripides, Athens went from the height of its political, cultural, and military supremacy to a period of great unease. In Carson's introduction, the artistic director of CSC compares the progression of Greek drama to the movement of the sun: Aeschylus' is dawn, Sophocles is noon, and Euripides is twilight. Carson also provides insightful introductions to each of the plays. These brief passages are scholarly and analytical, but they feel nothing like academic writing. They are full of cultural references, ranging from Bjork to Francis Bacon, that make the plays feel more accessible to the modern reader. Carson often uses creative pagination techniques, isolating single words and making particularly emotional passages scurry back and forth across the page. Carson's language throughout all three plays is exceedingly forceful and vivid. She uses original Greek expressions of suffering, such as ""OIMOI"" and ""PHEU."" She also creates compound adjectives that capture the nuances of the original language, such as ""manminded"" or ""firstblush."" At times, the familiarity of her language can be surprising, and it infuses the plays with a modern sense of humor. In ""Agamemnon,"" when the chorus questions Cassandra about her relationship with Apollo, the following exchange occurs: Cassandra: The fact is we wrestled. Chorus: Had sex? Cassandra: I said yes but defaulted. The directness of this exchange is striking. It grabs the audience's attention much more forcefully than Lattimore's version, in which the chorus asks, ""Did you come to the getting of children then, as people do?"" Certain critics may argue that Carson's writing detracts from some of the rhetorical force of the original Greek. And indeed, her direct style transforms the subtleties of the language into more overblown emotional displays. Yet the appeal of Carson's poetry is undeniable, and her work should be considered a new literary creation rather than a simple translation."
476,Global Core to decrease class sizes Committee on Major Cultures discusses shift in lecture classes,15 April 2009,"Committee on Major Cultures discusses shift in lecture classesBY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Staff WriterA year after the creation of the Columbia College Global Core requirement, faculty members are evaluating potential classes and looking to downsize large lecture courses to smaller seminars—neither of which have been simple tasks. The Global Core requirement, which replaced the Major Cultures requirement in 2008—a less Western-centric curriculum was one of the demands of the hunger strikers last fall—is intended to ""address several world settings or cultures comparatively,"" according to the University Web site, Students will also have the option of taking classes about ""a specific culture or civilization, tracing its appearance and/or existence across a significant span of time and sometimes across more than one present-day country or region."" It is in the process of slowly shifting from large lecture courses to smaller seminars and increasing the number of Global Core courses offered. Patricia Grieve, the Nancy and Jeffrey Marcus Professor of the Humanities and the chair of the Committee on the Core and the Committee on Major Cultures, said that the process of evaluation for potential future Global Core courses has been ""both ... formal and informal."" Formally, she said, the Committee on Major Cultures, which oversees the Major Cultures requirement and will eventually become the Committee on the Global Core when the official curriculum change is fully implemented, will approve all courses for the College. But she added that ""informal discussions"" are also taking place among committee members, faculty, and students about the best way to pursue shaping the new requirements. Specifically, the committee speaks with faculty members in various departments to discuss courses they want to develop or that they think should bemoved from the Major Cultures list and placed into the Global Core. Presently, the classes of 2011 and above may still elect to fulfill the Major Cultures requirement, while the classes of 2012 and younger must complete the Global Core instead. Even though some of the Major Cultures List B and C classes—specialized courses on major civilizations and its manifestations in the United States of specific cultures—have been cut from Global Core, many of the List A courses, which are broader introductory classes, have carried over with the transition. But not all students have been enthusiastic about the transition from Major Cultures to Global Core. Louis Fisher, CC 'll, opted to stick with the Major Cultures requirement and took Theories of Culture: Middle East and South Asia and Colloquium on Major Texts: East Asia last semester. ""I had a really good experience in both of them,"" Fisher said. The committee wants student input, Grieve said. But she added that ""students have to show patience,"" and that there are ""good principles undergirding the thinking behind the Global Core."" Though there are srudents on the Committee on the Core, the Committee on Major Cultures solicits wider undergraduate opinions on thecourses. The students on the Committee on the Core, which oversees ail aspects of the Core Curriculum, held a town hall meeting to discuss the requirement last year. ""1 think Columbia's determination to make the Global Core into a more seminar-based requirement will only serve to benefit the students,"" Derek Turner, CC 'l2, said. He added that, from his experience with Literature Humanities, he has found that ""seminars are much better than lectures at engaging the students and making the topic much more personal and applicable."" But according to Grieve, the main problem has been finding faculty to teach the courses. ""Due to the current climate where many of the hirings have been frozen, we have to think very carefully about how we maintain the curriculum we want for our students,"" she said. And the floundering economy remains a hurdle. ""I don't think that the number of courses will be decreased but I do think that we may have to rethink the process by which we hope to incorporate even more seminars into the Global Core,"" she added. Presently, a new list of Global Core courses has not been posted for the 2009-2010 school year. The current list will remain in place for the 2009 fall semester. Grieve said that a new list will be posted - for the November registration for the spring of next year. , news@columbiaspectator.com"
477,All the world is a salon,17 April 2009,"BY PAULA GERGENMen and women are gathered around a table. Open books are spread across the table. Speakers take turns sharing their ideas. Occasionally, arguments break out, and no one's ideas can be clearly heard. These people learned from what they've read, but they have gained far more knowledge from what they have heard from one another. The era is the eighteenth century. Gathered in a salon, intellectuals debate literature, politics, and philosophy. The salon, an important gathering place for conversation and amusement, was not only a space for the communication of intellectual ideas—it also helped spread the ideals of the Enlightenment. Though these gatherings may not take place in fashionable living rooms today, they exist nonetheless and have in fact become an important part of the Columbia experience.The place is Hamilton Hall, (fathered around a table, students discuss and debate Dante in Literature Humanities. Next door, a Contemporary Civilizations class is talking about Marx's theories. Many of the Core classes feature debates similar to those that took place in the eighteenth century. Were it not for the papers and exams, these discussion-based classes would be analogous to salons. But the influence of salons on Columbia is not limited to the classroom. Remnants of salons pervade the campus. They materialize in the group of friends discussing a class ortexts at the Hungarian Pastry Shop. They exist in the corny Lit Hum jokes posted on friends' Facebook walls. They are found in their more classical interpretation —French Cultural Society's Thursday night conversations at Max Caffe, where students from all levels of French converse and discuss various ideas. They can also be found at the ""Symposium"" hosted by my Lit Hum professor last semester. They are everywhere. The age of the salons has been called the ""age of conversation."" Today's ""information age"" allows these conversations to continue on many new levels and contributes to an important exchange of ideas essential to the smooth functioning of a university. Technology allows students and teachers to communicate constantly and immediately. Courseworks postings, for instance, are an example of the kind of online intellectual discussion that was never possible back in the eighteenth century. Whether they are lounging in cushy chairs in a Butler or sitting at dorm room desks, students are able to converse and debate withtheir professors. These online salons are a vital part of our Columbia education. Learning does not merely occur by listening to lectures or reading a textbooks. Rather, learning is most successful when it becomes an interactive experience—an experience that allows people from different backgrounds and perspectives to share ideas and offer feedback and to create a continual learning process. When signing up for classes next week, students should keep in mind that though smaller classes may have the unfortunate side effect of giving more work, they also have more discussions. This allows students to gain valuable knowledge from each other, an experience that many large lecture classes do not foster. In between classes, papers, and exams, 1 try to remind myself that—despite the workload associated with the Core—having rigorous academic discussions is one of the reasons I came to Columbia. What I didn't realize when I filled out my application over a year ago is that the Core is not just the study of ideas and works from the past few centuries —is are also the application of these ideas. It is one thing to learnabout philosophers through texts. It is quite another to be able to live out the same kind of intellectual debates that we read about. 1 Whether it is a conversation , with oneself, taking a cue I from Montaigne, or a conversation with others, after the company of the Decameron, such discussions still take place in the twenty-first century at Columbia. By selecting discus-sion-based classes and bringing learning outside the classroom, students can, in principle, create one giant salon. The author is a Columbia College first-year."
478,Testing out,27 April 2009,"BY KEVIN SUNFor the vast majority of Chinese high schoolers, taking the National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gaokao) and trying to get into a good Chinese univei'sity are the most natural things in the world. Many kids' lives are oriented around these goals from infancy. Students are swamped with classes after school and on weekends, and the last year of high school is spent doing almost nothing-other than taking piles upon piles of practice exams, without learning anything new (except test-taking techniques). Finally, the exam arrives in early June after senior year. Over the course of three days of extreme stress, all of a student s life experiences, talents, abilities, and personality get distilled down to a single number: the Gaokao score. All the universities have to do is look at the final distribution and decide on their cutoff score for the year. Essentially, they are enrolling numbers, and the actual people come afterward. This system sucks. As I neared the end of high school in China, being a U.S. citizen, I decided that studying in the U.S. would be a pretty straightforward thing to do. For one thing, I would be avoiding the hassle of Chinese examination fever. Also, I had no idea what 1 wanted to major in, and most Chinese universities have students specify their desired department before even taking the exam. My classmates found themselves holed into specific areas like ""information security,"" ""water supply management,"" and ""railroad engineering"" before even taking a single class, much less having any idea what their majors were actually like. That just wouldn't work for me. I may have been one of the few U.S. citizens applying from a regular, noninternational Chinese high school, but I was by no means the only Chinese high schooler who wanted .out of the system. While the roots of China's screwed-up, life-consuming college exam system can be traced back to the imperial examinations of the Tang Dynasty, China has an equally illustrious, albeit somewhat shorter, tradition of having its talented students pursue studies overseas. Many of China's greatest thinkers, writers, and political figures of the Modern Era received some education abroad, and were instrumental in accelerating the modernization of their country over the past century. As the Communist takeover soured China's relations with the West, however, such exchanges came to an almost total standstill for decades. My parents were part of the first generation to have the opportunity to study abroad again, after the Cultural Revolution ended. Having completed their studies, they returned to China and made great contributions in their respective fields (and put me in an odd, not-really-international/not-typical-U.S.-situation). To this day, thousands of eager Chinese students continue to be attracted to places of higher learning in the West, especially in the United States. Despite, or perhaps because of, the number of Chinese students wanting to study abroad, the Chinese government's attitude has been oddly ambivalent, at least at the undergraduate level, so there is not a single public SAT testing center in all of mainland China. There are other difficulties, too. Students need to develop very strong English skills to have any hope of going overseas. Assistance in the application process is hard to come by, letters of recommendation need to be translated, and sometimes school • administrators might even be reluctant to provide transcripts. Stressful and undesirable as it may be, the Gaokao remains the path of least resistance by a wide margin. Living and studying in another country is a huge undertaking. Not everyone is comfortable going far from home to stay at a place with different customs and ways of life. And yet the Chinese internationals I know have all adjusted really quickly to the life in the States, and perform well even in classes like Literature Humanities, where one would expect them to be disadvantaged. And while they understandably enjoy the company of their compatriots from time to time, they get along and socialize with students from the U.S. and other countries just as easily. They are sociable, outgoing, open-minded, and can go after an objective with all their energies once they decide on it. It would be quite hard to imagine a Chinese student getting into an American university, much less an Ivy, without these traits. And these things are precisely what the Chinese exam system in its current form is unable to reflect. I suppose a lot of this applies to students from other countries as well. Surely, going abroad to pursue an education is never the easiest choice. Making that decision takes a special kind of person. International students are not afraid to take matters into their own hands in order to get what they want. With that spirit, and everything they learn while over here, it is to be hoped that they will do great things, wherever they were born. The author is a Columbia College first-year."

Curriculum and academics The new deans should follow up on hiring two senior tenure-track professors for the Center for the Study ofEthnitity and Race. With two professors expected to leave the center next year, CSER must continue to provide richer and more advanced offerings. Administrators previously reported that Global Core classes will decrease in size to emulate other Core classes like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. The administration should apply the same rigorous standards of these Core classes to the Global Core, and do their best to move away from large lectures to ensure that Columbia becomes, in feet, a university committed to global-minded education. Health, wellness, and dining Dining must provide more convenient, time-efficient, and economical options. Meal plans and health services should collaborate to accommodate students with food restrictions, such as allergies. The off-campus Flex system must be more reliable and efficient to attract a greater number of off-campus establishments. Dining Services should increase the number of locations that accept meal swipes, such as Ferris Booth Commons, especially since first-year plans are mandatory and students cannot cancel meal plans after enrolling in them. The University alcohol policy should encourage responsible behavior reasonable for of-age students. Forbidding alcohol in the common areas ofsuites for legal students maylead to solitary, binge drinking rather than moderate, social drinking. The University must show that it trusts the judgement of its seniors at events that involve alcohol, treating them as the future professionals they are rather than people who need constant supervision. Research opportunities and expansion The construcdon of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center and nearcompletion of the Interdisciplinary Science Building bring a chance to establish Columbiaas the leader among research universities. Opportunities for undergraduate research should be increased, centralized, and better publicized. Administrators should grant undergraduates an active role in Manhattanville planning and space allocation, especially since today's students will be among the alumni the University will count on to fund the construction of the new campus. Student advising The administration has made strides in restructuring student advising, but the new deans must continue to review the advising process. To start, all advisers should be familiar with Core requirements. Major advising should be provided to students earlier, and all major advisers should be fluent in their respective majors' requirements. Columbia should also provide students with programming to increase their fluency in practical financial skills, which are more crucial considering the economy. A new academic year and new administrators bring tliepromiseofchange. Deans Moody-Adams and Pena-Mora will lace the challenge of balancing Columbia's bureaucratic structure and fiscal constraints with the University s reputation for academic excellence and a high quality of student life. Students, whether through student council, clubs, or media, along with alumni, must hold the new administrators accountable and make sure the University continues to move forward."
480,"Academics expand with globalization, contract with budget cuts Global Core, Global Centers introduced in 08-09; due to large expense, Columbia slashes Ph.D. programs by 10 percent",11 May 2009,"Global Core, Global Centers introduced in 08-09; due to large expense, Columbia slashes Ph.D. programs by 10 percentBY SCOTT LEVI AND AMBER TUNNELL Columbia Daily SpectatorWhen Barnard history professor Owen Gutfreund, the popular, long-time director of the school's urban studies program, was denied tenure in December 2007, many students and faculty argued that he deserved better. But in fall 2008, Gutfreund received news suggesting his fate had been rewritten. Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation and Faculty of Arts and Sciences offered the specialist in urban history a joint appointment. Yet as proof of the blow the financial crisis has dealt the University, FAS announced this spring it could not afford to pay its half of the appointment. Instead, Gutfruend is slated to take a position at Hunter College of the City University of New York this fall. Gutfreund's story is not unique. Even as Columbia stays afloat in a market where universities flounder, financial concerns caused departures and prompted arrivals this year, and are now pervading the University's pursuit of its long-term academic goals. Some developments from the 2008-2009 school year, like the newfound autonomy of the School of International and Public Affairs, are not tied to the economic downturn. Others, including initiatives begun in previous years to globalize and refine bureaucracy, point to Columbia's constant awareness of the harm the current crisis is doing to higher education inside the gates and across the country. Making the cuts Data released this year suggests that as domestic and foreign financial troubles persist, students should expect to see fewer international and Ph.D. students on Columbia's campus next year. The American Language Program, whose English language instruction reaches vast South Korean, French, Chinese,.and Japanese populations in Columbia's undergraduate and graduate schools, received fewer applications. ""Economic changes and fluctuations in currency rates have had a significant impact on Asian clientele,"" Peter Awn, dean of theSchool of General Studies where the program is housed, said in February. According to Nicholas Dirks, vice president for arts and sciences, the University is admitting 10 percent fewer doctoral students due to the high costs of operating doctorate programs, and the diminished job market for aspiring professors. Going global Amid reductions in international students, the University has sought to expand its horizons in the world platform in other ways. In March, the Columbia Global Centers in Beijing and Amman, Jordan opened. They are meant to serve as research offices as opposed to the satellite campuses some peer institutions have opened. University President Lee Bollinger told Spectator in February that the research held at these centers aims to ""expand our global understanding and to make a contribution to the world but to do it in a way that's not local or regional, but linked globally."" Many view the openings as a tangible realization of Bollinger's, ""global university"" initiative. According to Kenneth Prewitt, professor of public affairs at Columbia and director of the Global Centers, by establishing the centers Columbia is taking connections it already has established around the world turning them into, ""a global network."" The bond between China and Columbia, for instance, goes back 100 years to an era in which Columbia became one of the first American schools to accept students from China. The University is just beginning its global expansion and hopes to ""cover every world region,"" including South Africa, South America, and Central Europe, according to Prewitt. He added that the next global centers will launch in India and Paris, the latter likely in conjunction with Columbia's Reid Hall for the study of French language and culture. While administrators traveled to Beijing for the opening in March, Barnard held its first ever symposium there, titled ""Women Changing China,"" featuring panelists such as English professor and women's advocate Wu Qing, novelist Geling Yan,Chinese-American filmmaker Ruby Yang, and media entrepreneur Yang Lan. This ties into Spar's mission to increase the international student population found at Barnard. Curricular reforms Undergraduate education received its dose of globalization as well. After last year's hunger strike demands capped an ongoing discussion about a change to the Major Cultures requirement, the Global Core premiered in mid-August to replace the old requirement. The Global Core was created to help solve the disunity of Major Cultures, which consisted of an array of courses ranging from broad introductory courses to language classes. The Global Core requires Columbia College students to take two courses from one vast list of courses, which predominantly deal with examin ing cultures comparatively or examining one civilization in depth across time. This requirement is different from Major Cultures, which had students choose two courses from three different lists of classes. Many introductory courses which previously counted toward Major Cultures courses have been adopted by the Global Core, while only some specialized courses carry over to new requirement. The Global Core aims to have students focus more on broad world cultures instead of only learning about one civilization. The focus on broad introductory courses has increased average class size for these courses by eliminating some of the smaller, specialized courses from the requirement. In the future, Patricia Grieve, humanities professor and chair of the Committee on the Core and the Committee on Major Cultures, said she hopes the Global Core will achieve ""parity with Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities"" in regard to academic rigor and seminar format. Presently, the class of 2011 and older classes may still elect to fulfill the Major Cultures requirement, while the. classes of 2012 and younger must complete the Global Core instead. Columbia is not the only one to have endeavored to make undergraduate education more relevant to the times. Barnard faculty is currently reviewing the Nine Waysof Knowing, Barnard's general education requirements, which have not been reviewed in depth in more than a decade. According to Muzna Ansari, representative to the Office of Academic Affairs and BC 'lO, professors have called several areas into question. One is the ""Reason and Value"" requirement —some, for example; want to ground it in more ""moral and ethical reasoning."" The courses that would fulfill this mandate would be more focused on urban studies and philosophy. Sorting out the Columbia bureaucracy Although the Faculty of Arts and Sciences responded to financial conditions by tightening its budget in a number of areas-, two major efforts to streamline contained no direct link to economic downturn. Administrators revealed plans this year to demystify the bureaucracy that supervises 29 departments—or 650 professors. A faculty-run review, begun in spring 2008 and brought to speed in the fall, seeks to address a culture of discontent among professors who express concerns that the labyrinth of governance committees decreases effective responses to their complaints. ""The faculty who have been involved for a long time largely agree that our current ... system relegates academic planning to a secondary role rather than a primary role, and leaves the faculty out of decision-mak-ing,"" astronomy department chair David Helfand said in an interview in January. The current review seeks to make more effective use of the tangle of committees whose advisory status and lack of mutual communication has diminished faculty participation. The Executive Committee of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, which is conducting the review, exemplifies the way governance has historically disheartened faculty, recycling a small group of unusually dedicated professors. Complaints range from minor inconveniences with faculty ID cards to administrative neglect to update professors on office relocation. ""Ultimately, the idea is to make people realize that the faculty committeesdo do important work, and that more people should volunteer to be involved,"" Dirks said in January. ""It has to be a broader group."" As the committee considers alternative models—including one that filters all proposals through a central body of faculty representatives—it is unclear whether major changes will be made to FAS's decentralized budget. On the other hand, Dirks' office, which currently chooses how to allocate SIPA's funds, is to hand that responsibility over to the SIPA administration in the fall. As 27 professors in SIPA are jointly appointed with other departments, SIPA dean John Coatsworth has said that freeing up the budget will increase transparency for donors while upholding significant curricular and research links. This comes at a time when SIPA revamps its degree programs, reducing the number of concentrations and offering regional specializations for students. ""SIPA will maintain close ties to the Arts and Sciences, but will have the financial and academic independence to develop in new and exciting ways,"" Coatsworth wrote in.an e-mail to SIPA faculty in March. Even so, SIPA is grappling with the issue of University expansion. Though administrators have stated that SIPA will resettle in a building on the Manhattanville campus in 2015, jointly appointed political Science and economics professors are torn between staying in their Morningside home departments and accompanying SIPA uptown. ""The links between political science, economics, and SIPA are very, very deep,"" political science professor Robert Jervis, who teaches at SIPA, said in April. ""If econ and poli sci do move, that will, over the long run, change the intellectual nature of SIPA."" His colleague, political science chair John Huber, has voiced his fear that a spatial disconnect could force SIPA to build its own specialized faculty. No formal decisions have been made about office movement. In an interview in April, Coatsworth said that ""over the course of the next 12 months, we'll know a lot more than we know now."" news@columbiaspectator. com"

482,Colleagues mourn beloved former dean,11 September 2009,"BY KATIE MAS Spectator Staff WriterCarl Hovde, CC '5O and dean of Columbia College from 1968 to 1972, passed away last Saturday in New Canaan, Connecticut. He was 84. The cause was cancer, according to Hovde's close friend and colleague in the English department Michael Rosenthal, PhD '67. ""He earned the admiration of students and faculty alike. He had the capacity to exude the rationality of things and negotiate between different views,"" Rosenthal said. ""He had a sort of inner dignity about him which was able to make things happen."" Hovde became dean during one of the most turbulent times of Columbia's history. University plans to build a gymnasium in Morningside Park with a separate entrance for neighborhood residents sparked an uproar among student activists and local protesters. This construction project, a symbol of racial tension as the civil rights movement reached a climax, was countered with sit-ins and rallies met by police violence. The unrest of the '6B riots poured into the following years and Dean Hovde is said to have played a large role in restoring peace on campus. Hovde was also a longstanding professor emeritus of English, who specialized in the American wing of the English department and taught Literature Humanities for many years. English professor James Mirollo, MA '5l, PhD '6l and one of Hovde's close friends, said that he was a ""stalwart of the Core Curriculum and a scrupulous scholar,"" who presided asdean when the Core underwent fundamental changes. The Society of Columbia Graduates awarded Hovde with the Great Teacher Award in 1975. He retired in 1995 and became director of the Friends of the Heyman Center for Humanities. In 1997, Hovde received the Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum. Beyond his many career accomplishments, Hovde's colleagues admire him most for his character. Rosenthal remembers him as ""a very altogether special person, a man of immense strength and grace who everyone loves."" Mirollo added that Hovde was ""a delightful colleague and dear friend, much beloved."" A memorial service will be held in St.. Paul's Chapel on October 22 at 3:30, according to Mirollo, and will feature reminiscences from Hovde's colleagues, friends, and family. A reception will follow in the Italian Academy. news@columbiaspectator.com"
483,"TV Booze, sex and a dash of stale melodrama on AMC",16 September 2009,"Booze, sex and a dash of stale melodrama on AMCCHRISTOPHER MORRIS-LENT Spectator Staff Writer""Its main theme is change,"" the ""Mad Men"" set decorator said to an NPR interviewer. Now that the third season is underway, I am confident that this was a flat-out lie—maybe one that the show's producers believe, too, but a lie anyway, since nothing ever happens on ""Mad Men."" If ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is a comedy without jokes, ""Mad Men"" is a drama without a plot. What happened in seasons one and two? Not a whole lot—barely enough, in fact, to be condensed into the ""previously on 'Mad Men'"" montage aired right before the first episode of season three. Here is some dialogue from those scenes: ""I want you to be my wife."" ""Just don't come home."" ""I had your baby... and I gave it away."" ""I'm pregnant."" Are you sensing a pattern here? This is the same kind of crap that sustains telenovelas and soap operas. ""Mad Men"" traffics exclusively in wellworn tropes and banalities. It is even less about advertising than ""The Big Lebowski"" is about bowling. Its subjects are love, adultery, working, and children. Its themes are trite. Its pacing is lethargic. And nobody seems to mind. Why? I think it has everything to do with the target demographic. The average ""Mad Men"" viewer considers himself above typical prime-timefare. He is at work when the re-runs of ""General Hospital"" are on. He objects to the notion of TV in general. He also abhorsiowbrow conventionality, with its bad dialogue, outlandish scenarios, and demand of total passivity. So he loves ""Mad Men."" He loves its fine writing, its meticulous historicity, and its sumptuous sets. And because plot is all that matters for a typical TV drama, he likes that there isn't one. He is the same mensch in your Literature Humanities class who, during ""To The Lighthouse,"" exclaimed, ""Plot is the least important aspect of a book."" None of this would matter if ""Mad Men"" didn't have the potential to be a great show. But it does. With such a relevant subject, you'd think the writers would use it to their advantage. After all, advertising is compelling stuff—it permeates our present consciousness and dictates our future media. I had a professor who viewed history as a series of information revolutions, and what better topic to put at the center of this than advertising? The forces were revolutionary, and the possible subjects were inexhaustible. And yet the writers, who pen flawless sentences about nothing, are content to make Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) the head of the television department and leave it at that. And the critics rave. But defining yourself in opposition to an ethos is not the same as having an ethos. ""Mad Men"" has little character beyond the woodpaneled offices, bottles of whiskey, and silhouettes smoking cigarettes. Without a plot, it turns into the kind of period piece that's contained within its era instead of vice versa, and it falls prey to the same superficiality it wants to float above.MAD BOREDOM I Despite its mass and critical appeal, AMC's hit show ""Mad Men"" can't please everyone —it dangles by a thread as a primetime show without a plot."
484,Core consistency,16 September 2009,"BY CAITLIN BROWNOn Wednesday, Sept. 9, 20(39, 20 fresh faces turned sour in the dusty twilight of Butler Library. Hunched over laptop computers, soaring through bits and bytes and cookies, these firstyear students on a mission to impress a certain Literature Humanities professor inevitably found themselves cursing out the stony wrinkles of Alma Mater. I sat among them, an Iliad-literate prep school graduate utterly unprepared for the baffling question professor Zeus had posed for the deliberation of the mere mortals: ""Why, then, is Trojan the number-one selling condom brand in the United States? Consider that""—to a smattering of titters —""for class Thursday."" As I read the Iliad that night, I sincerely hoped she did not expect a serious response, for the answer, I knew, was not in the stacks. Across campus, my roommate toiled, engaged in the same sort of preliminary over-preparation for the dreaded first Lit Hum assignment. I assumed, as Lit Hum is the foundation class of the Core Curriculum as well as the uniting literary fodder for discussions in the classroom and the dining hall and the laundry room, that she, too, would be grappling with a similar bizarre task.I returned, however, to find her hunched over a mangled red saucer sled, crafting a ""virtual representation of the shield of Achilleus."" It was then that I realized the following: although we all read the same texts, the discrepancy among the focal points of sections of Core classes makes for a wholly different learning experience for each class, and, indeed, each individual. This incongruity among sections of Core classes seems to contradict the reputation of the Core Curriculum as an educational foundation and a common bond. The Core classes, we are told, will be the bank of intellectualism from which we will draw ideas and skills for future classes and life in general. The lectures about Homer and Sophocles are a sort of hazing process, an admittance ritual into ""an intellectual community that includes Columbia graduates in different places, different careers, and different generations."" This stuff, they tell us, this jumbled syntax, these obscure passages —this is the stuff of Pul itzer-win ning novels and drunken cocktail conversations with other alumni down the road. Covering 24 books of Homer's epic in three to four class periods, a professor can only touch on so many things while still engaging each to a reasonable degree of depth. How will I comfortably bond with another Columbia grad over a martini and the Iliad when my Lit Hum professor lectured about Thersites the ugly and hers lectured about the role of hubris?Even more striking are the curricular differences between sections of University Writing. Dissecting an essay titled ""In Our Glory: Photography and Black Life,"" I inquired to a group of first-year friends as to the details of a related historical event only to find that they had all read different articles, the subjects of which ranged from New York to ""values of difficulty"" to Eminem. Although we would all eventually write the same essay assignments, there became evident an astounding lack of commonality in the primary aspects of seminars that were supposedly the same. This, then, begs the question: Should Columbia truly streamline the Core? Although the Core Curriculum varies to a surprising degree in nature and content, these deviations play a vital role, actually reflecting the Core's central philosophy that, though the content of these great texts is important, the analytical skills honed in their study are lasting, unifying, and powerful. The multitude of professors and consequent diversity of ideas that each brings to the classroom foster a college-wide atmosphere of potential intellectual pandemonium. The consistent teaching of fundamental literary analysis and effective writing skills, however, harness that chaos and allow instead for the successful integration of thousands of unique perspectives. The author is a Columbia College first-year."
485,Letters to the editor,17 September 2009,"Core Curriculum professors require experience, not just enthusiasm To the Editor: I was dismayed by Scott Levi's first assertion in ""How to Survive—and love—the Core Curriculum"" (Sept. 1) that ""The Core pushes you to shed preconceived notions, and you will do just that upon realizing that your doctoral student instructor leads as fantastic a section as that of his famed dissertation adviser."" Levi is right—tenure is no guarantee of professorial wisdom. A grad student might lead a better section than a full professor of philosophy. Likewise, a precocious resident might perform a better bypass than a cardiac surgeon. Given the choice, however, I'd take the surgeon. Levi says ""time [for] students, scholarly background, and workload"" are the criteria by which to judge a Core professor. I disagree. Because Core classes are required for so many students, the range of teachers is huge—and quite a few are pretty far from their area of expertise. Familiarity with the material is the one indispensable thing, and this means either Core veterans or literature and philosophy professors. I did what Levi is proposing. My Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilizationsprofessor (I can't remember any longer which) was a young, freshly minted Ph.D. He'd never taught the Core before, and freely acknowledged that, like us, he was reading things for the first time. It wasn't a great class. And it wasn't his fault. The volume of reading is enormous. Asking someone to learn and then teach all this stuff in a matter of days is like asking someone to eat a 10-course meal and then go swimming. People need time to digest. The professor who knows the books backwards and forwards, thanks to multiple re-readings and the study of secondary sources and who can contextualize, fill in gaps, and elucidate hidden connections, is the professor who transforms the Core from a burden to a blessing. Mark Bulliet, CC 'O2 Sept. 6, 2009 Optimism and honesty make NSOP, the Core, and Columbia a better place To the Editor: 1 just wanted to thank Spectator for starting out the new school year on such a positive note. Spectator has a crucial role inthe morale and dialogue of our University, and I really appreciated the honest, optimistic take on the Core and on student life at Columbia that you included in the first issue after NSOP. This is exactly the sort of language that contributes to creating safe spaces for discussion and continuing discourse. I much prefer the recent issues' tone to the offensive, abrasive commentary of past issues that complains more than it informs or gives advice for solutions to the problems we experience. I also pompletely agree with the staff editorial about creating some semblance of a post-NSOP survey. As a former NSOP employee, I know that there is a tremendous amount of work that goes into putting NSOP together. Though each new NSOP committee truly does its best to make NSOP as fun, informative, and accessible as they can, there is still an incredible amount of progress that the program can stand to make for coming generations of CU students, and that change begins and ends with the students. Rock on, Spec, thanks for such a great, open-minded start to my senior year! Laura Taylor, CC 'lO Sept. 14, 2009"
486,THEATER Students take modern 'Odyssey' downtown,22 September 2009,"Students take modern 'Odyssey' downtownBY AMANDA GUTTERMAN Columbia Daily SpectatorDescending the winding staircase into the underground box theater—only a few blocks from New York University's diaspora of buildings—it seemed only appropriate that such a journey should be made in order to view ""Homer's Odyssey."" With a small but flexible cast and a script remastered by Simon Armitage, ""Homer's Odyssey""—as performed by the Handcart Ensemble at the Bleecker Street Theatre—served as an intermediary between Literature Humanities' study of the ""Odyssey"" and the work's practical implications in modern life. The British Broadcasting Corporation commissioned and broadcasted ""Homer's Odyssey"" in 2004, though the play made its first stage appearance in New York this September. While all the September shows sold out online through Brown Paper Tickets, the Handcart Ensemble plans to reopen Armitage's adaptation from Oct. 2-18. An acclaimed poet and interpreter of classic texts, Armitage is known for converting works such as Euripides's ""The Madness of Heracles"" into scripts with a distinct theatrical feel. In ""Homer'sOdyssey"" specifically, the tension between modern and archaic speech characteristic of Armitage's work remains tenable throughout. David D'Agostini as Odysseus rolls his ""R's"" and uses occasionally flowery but accessible language, while the piggish sailors in his crew lapse into modern slang. Armitage's interpretation begins with Odysseus's washing up naked and starving on a beach in Phaeacia, barely distinguisF-"" able from seaweed. Nausicaadhe pubescent Phaeacian princess who rescues him, plays a much more important role in the play than in the original text. This grants the viewer greater insight than the reader into her character and reinforces the motif of women—from Circe to Athena to Penelope—as guides in Odysseus's journey. She swoons girlishly over the protagonist at every possible interval—could ""nauseating"" stem from ""Nausicaa""? Later, with the audience set up to be guests and observers at their table, Odysseus chronicles his adventures before the feasting Phaecian nobles. The gods appear frequently, but many plot elements are omitted, like the bag of winds, Scylla, and Charybdis. The underworld scene with Tiresias is most magical, with ghosts emerging from behind acurtain of black gauze. This contributes to the understanding of the play as continuous with the ""Iliad,"" as Agamemnon and Achilles appear, showing how even the greatest heroes are humbled by death. Achilles even seems to regret his decision to live a brief and glorious life, which was central to the plot of the ""Iliad."" Employing such stage elements as silhouettes behind backlit screens, life-sized puppets representing fantastical creatures, and poles that serve as sailing masts or hunting spears juxtaposed by the minimalism with props, the Handcart production colors the play with a modern edge. Costumes are classic takes on togas and armor, and the audience is a curious hybrid of elderly folks and the college theater crowd, integrating Columbia's young Lit Hum students with the greater contingent of people fascinated by Homeric epics. ""Homer's Odyssey"" will play a different role in Lit Hum classes' discussion of the Odyssey than the movie ""Troy"" of the ""Iliad,"" whose summary was inferior to that of Sparknotes in terms of quality. Rather, Armitage's interpretation is an expansion on the existing text with distinct points of emphasis that illupninate characters or events underdeveloped in the cursory hours of class."
487,What's your GPA?,24 September 2009,"An hour and a half of remedial math, some teenagers struggling to perform at grade level, some understimulated, everyone bored, an incompetent teacher who delegates the responsibility for class control and pedagogy to her more able, I mean more obsequious, students—and it's universally mandatory until the end of the semester. Public high school? Hell no—this was Frontiers of Science, and what I described above constituted my very first step into the Styx of higher education. Looking back on it, learning anything from the class was out of the question. My seminar leader was wretched, and education for the sake of education is simply not possible when there's a requirement that nearly everyone hates. I could have gotten something out of it, though: a grade; so I'm only a little embarrassed that after discovering I got a B-plus—-this after a late burst of sitting in the front, evincing interest, completing 'independent projects,' 'taking the initiative,' pretending to buy into 'peer learning,' and attaching clip-art to my homework—l considered transferring. This might have been good for Columbia and me, but I was rejected from everywhere I wanted to go because my grades were mediocre. It's like how SEAS will let you bow out, but you have to have the grades to do it. Many of my later bad grades have been my own fault, but not all of them. Learningshould always be the goal of a class. But if requirements curb curiosity and force venality, then they should at least be equitable in their student assessments. They aren't. CULPA pages are littered with reviews attesting to this. The grades issue is, I'm sure, tied to another way in which requirements are bungled: grad students. Grad students teach Art Humanities, Music Humanities, University Writing, and some teach Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations too, not to mention the introduction classes for your major. We might as well throw away the pretense that these are the most important classes of college if full professors aren't teaching them. But grad students —speaking very broadly—are bad in another way. They grade oddly and capriciously, more on effort than capability. An A-minus and a B-plus are often the only available marks. Everyone is above average, but only by so much. I suspect this is based on insecurity. Grad students are the antithesis of'too cool for school.' A friend and I conducted a post-mortem of our Art Hum instructor. He said that ""she was a tough grader for someone who didn't demonstrate very acute intelligence."" There has to be some way of demonstrating their superiority. It comes at the undergrads' expense —we are, after all, the paying customers. A less pressing issue is the imbalance in grades between different departments. Your GPA can be determined more by your major than by your talent and effort. This could be cut down by eliminating the A-plus. Which other school has these? They flourish only in our quantitative departments. All our valedictorians and salutatorians come from fields that give lousy speeches. If your abilities are really so remarkable, an A should be enough, and ifyou're working hard enough to get an A-plus, you're wasting your time. Academic success should come as a happy accident—not from hours of miserable travail. After applying a certain amount of effort, you start to hit diminishing returns. A race to the top in GPA is a race to the bottom in learning. This brings me to the problem at hand. Your GPA is a poor metric of what you got out of your experience, and an even poorer one for what you will get out of future experiences. This wouldn't be a concern if Professor Peter Bearman's cliche that 'your grades in college do not matter' was true. But it isn't. Bearman assigns them anyway, and they do matter —for grad school, for jobs, for whatever you will do after college. People talk a lot about grades at Columbia. The proof of their primacy is in the talking. On my visits to Reed, Pomona, and Amherst, the topic has been taboo—they are as meaningless and as seldom talked about as SAT scores. But our culture here has much more in common with a big, public research university than a small liberal arts college. The Darwinian market of New York exerts its workaholic pull. We are encouraged to compare ourselves to others, not others to ourselves, and find one or the other wanting. 'Comparisons are odious,' goes the old platitude. But what else do we have? 1 think the big lesson here is that people care about grades here as a means of asserting themselves over an experience over which they may have very little control. As in the case of this column, it is self-defeating. Chris Morris-Lent is a Columbia College senior majoring in English.

488,ROSENTHAL: A LOOK BACK,24 September 2009,"interview by Raphael Pope-SussmanA professor looks back on four decades at Columbia,cover photo by Alyssa RappA PROFESSOR LOOKS BACK ON FOOR DECADES AT COLOMBIAINTERVIEW BY RAPHAEL POPE-SUSSMAN • PHOTOS BY ALYSSA RAPP AND COURTESY OF MICHAEL ROSENTHALPROFESSOR MICHAEL ROSENTHAL has spent more than four decades studying, teaching, and (in his words) ""deaning"" at Columbia. This fall marks the beginning of his final year here, as he will retire at the end of the spring semester. Rosenthal, who received his doctorate from Columbia in 1967, began his career as an instructor in the English department. From 1969 to 1971, he was an assistant professor. Then, in 1972, he left the classroom to become associate dean of Columbia College, a title he held for almost 20 years. In 1989, he returned to the English department. More recently, Rosenthal has served as the Roberta and William Campbell Professor in the Teaching of Literature Humanities. He also is the author of three books, the most recent of which, ""Nicholas Miraculous,"" is a biography of former Columbia President Nicholas Murray Butler. In an interview with The Eye in his book-filled office in Philosophy Hall, Rosenthal discusses 40 years of Columbia, his love for the Core Curriculum, and his ""deadly"" jump shot.Why spend your entire career at Columbia? The freedom of an urban environment is really what appeals to me. Although, because I grew up in New York, 1 didn't want to go to school here. But once I came back to graduate school, I began to feel this really was my mature home. And that's been wonderful. To me, a community that is entirely academic is suffocating, and so I delight in the fact that one has one's academic environment here, but then you go five blocks away and you're in another world. That, to me, is life-giving. I think Columbia is very much a life-giving place, which is why 1 find it so attractive. And why I think when it works for students—which it doesn't always do—but when it does, it really works in serious ways. I mean, you know, the best thing about having gone to Harvard is that one doesn't have to worry about not having gone to Harvard. I never found anyone—and this can't be true—but all the people I knew were not particularly shaped by Harvard in any sort of way. And that's not true of Columbia kids. I think Columbia students, because of the curriculum, because of the city or whatever, when it works on them it really does give them something, it turns them into something interesting. I don't think Harvard does that. You went from instructor to associate dean of Columbia College in four years, then later returned to the English department as a professor. Has what you've called this ""strange, backwards career"" affected your perspective on Columbia as an institution? Well, I think it did. First of all, I liked what I call my ""deanly life."" It's fascinating to see how institutions work, and where the power is and how one negotiates all these things. But since the normal trajectory is to teach, until somehow, your ambitions for a certain kind of power or your boredom of teaching leads you to become a dean, 1 think it's sort of life-giving to begin deaning and then to decide in a fully conscious way that what one would really like to do is to return to teaching and to writing and to being with students.So I think my returning to the classroom, having been a dean, was invaluable to me as a means of understanding what the institution is about. I think Columbia faculty tend to live really fairly particular lives in departments. Departments are really what run the institution, not the divisions. And so you only learn essentially the affairs of the department. ... You don't really have a sense of what the whole thing is doing. When I became a dean, I didn't know anything about the college. I knew about the English department. So learning about the college was extraordinary and then learning about the institution. So who knows how it in any particular way affected my teaching, but I think it gave me a perspective on the University that I like to think was useful to the students ... when I returned to teaching.How has Columbia changed in your time here? Clearly, the fundamental change was the admission of women, which turned the place entirely into a more interesting, vibrant, vital, funny, terrific place. And so half the students that were admitted almost immediately were women, and that clearly changed the whole ambience and nature of the place. People always ask me, ""Are the students now much smarter than the students were?"" Because now there are 25,000 people that apply, so they statistically have to be, and I say, ""No, they're really quite different."" But it's not clear to me, you know, they're more sophisticated, they're more affluent, they obviously have all sorts of skills dealing withtechnology. But they're not as committed to books as a means of understanding the world as they were when I hrst got here. And you can lament that, but I think that's just the reality of things. When I was first teaching, if one mentioned Philip Roth or Norman Mailer or whatever, there would be kids whose eyes would light up, who would have read them, or would go and read them. Now if you mention those things, people just look at you as if, ""Who are those people?"" With some exceptions, obviously. Book culture, which was really so much a part of the Columbia spirit, has diminished. Other things have taken their place. That, to me, is a huge change. Kids are much more affluent now. More kids from prep schools. That has both a good and a bad effect on the place. The whole nature of early decision has changed the profile of applicants, in ways that are not always salubrious. ... TTie downside of early decisionism is that people who know about early decision are people who tend to be more affluent, who don't need to weigh scholarship offers. And so it's a different profile of kids. And what the consequence is—though 1 think the University doesn't want to talk about it—that the financial aid bill is kept under control. Now, on the one hand, that's fine, because money is money. And you have to look to the budget. On the other hand, that's not so fine. So that's a concern. You're a big advocate of the Core Curriculum. What do you find so appealing about the Core? I think the curriculum of Columbia College is a big piece of what's great about Columbia College. To read Homer and to read Aeschylus and to read Dante and Boccaccio—these are major formative intellectual, and even emotional, experiences. So I think that Columbia students are extraordinarily lucky, although I'm told that not all Columbia students come here knowing there is a Core Curriculum, which I find astonishing. But assuming they have chosen to come here because of the Core Curriculum, 1 think it's a great choice, and I"
489,Get some (Core) class,16 November 2009,"All Columbia undergraduates have to take them —the required classes that constitute our early years. But do they go on to constitute part of us? This week, four students assess the foundations of our education. Jennifer Fearon examines what it means to re-read classics in Barnard's First-Year English, Joseph Rozenshtein writes off University Writing, Sarah Ngu suggests it simply needs a few edits, and Neil Fitzpatrick merges the practical and the pedantic in his position on Literature Humanities."
490,Lit Hum a year later,16 November 2009,"BY NEIL FITZPATRICKMuch has been said about the Core. It provides a firm grounding in the Western canon. It contains too many dead white males. It is a perfectly good cause for a hunger strike. It is one of the reasons that many students (including yours truly) came to Columbia. The Columbia College bulletin calls it ""the cornerstone of a Columbia education."" My roommate calls it ""a royal pain in the ass."" One of the things not often said about the Core, however, is that it is useful. The bulletin does offer that ""the skills and habits honed by the Core—observation, analysis, argument, imaginative comparison, respect for ideas, nuances, and differences —provide a rigorous preparation for life as an intelligent citizen in today's complex and changing world."" And this is true. University Writing could make you a better writer, and Lit Hum will certainly teach you how to read and analyze quickly (or at least improve your Sparknoting skills). But one might argue that the skills and values supposedly instilled by the Core —analysis, argument, respect for diverse ideas—could just as easily be imbued by an alternative course of study—say, one found at any of the other top universities. The fact is that it is the content of the Core that sets it apart, and the content of the Core which most people would hesitate to call ""useful."" The content of which I write is that of the first four courses introduced to the curriculum—Contemporary Civilizations, Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities. They are classes chiefly concerned with the Western canon, and expose students to many of the great thinkers, writers, musicians, and artists of the Western world. The question is why. I am not, by any means, equipped to fully answer that question. As a sophomore, I have only completed one of the aforementioned classes: Lit Hum. Only time and chance will determine just how useful an education in the Core proves to be in the adult world of job markets and families. I can, however, attest to how useful the content of Lit Hum has been during my as-yet brief time in college. It began first semester freshman year, when I yialked into Modern Poetry, which I chose Bfe'iHiseTli'ked tWo of the poets mentioned in the course description, and not because I knew they were ""modernists,"" or because I had any real idea of what ""modernism"" was. The first lecture was a wake-up call—the first sign that my college education would be very, very different from my experience in high school. It took about two more sessions before the material stopped going over my head, and three more after that before I worked up the courage to raise my hand and participate. Most significant, though, was that as the semester wore on, my ability to analyze the poetry improved not just because I had been listening to my professor do analysis for months, but also because the works I was reading in Lit Hum were directly referenced in much of the modernist poetry we were studying. So when I came upon poems by Yeats like ""Adam's Curse"" or ""No Second Troy,"" my knowledge of Genesis and The Iliad helped me understand the context of the poems better than I ever could have from only reading the footnotes. The same was especially true later when we came to Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, both of whom referenced Homer, Ovid, and Dante so much that William Carlos Williams got sick of it all and decided to give the poet's version of a slap in a face by referencing a red wheelbarrow and some chickens. At least, I think that's what I was supposed to take away from the class. The education we are getting here with the Core—this grounding in the Western canonis not just knowledge that helps you seem smart at the proverbial cocktail party. Classes like Lit Hum add context to and enrich our education going forward. Even this year, in Contemporary Civilizations, Machiavelli references battles and historical figures straight out of Homer, Herodotus, and Thucydides. In Music Hum, we learn that Wagner, in writing opera, wanted to harken back to what he believed were the glory days of Ancient Greece, when, in the dramas we read in Lit Hum, all of the arts—literature, drama, music, dance, and gymnastics —were fused into one mode of expression. In psychology, we learn that Aristotle, of all people, could be considered the father of that field of study. Of course, one might argue that the content of the Core is only useful to people taking courses in the humanities, or only in the setting of other Core classes. And this is true to a certain degree—the literature read in Lit Hum may be more immediately useful to an aspiring English major than a math major. But to a large extent, the content of the Core offers context not just for ideas encountered in later academic settings, but also for the ideas that govern our world—why we study math, why we search for truth, how to best govern a state, how we can learn from history, what the purpose of art is, etc. It is this context which could be said to be the goal of education, the opposite of ignorance. It is what will allow us, both in our lives as college students, and perhaps even later in that world of job markets and families, to make informed decisions about any problems that cross our paths. And if, in the meantime, it helps me be a little less stupefied by ""The Wasteland""—well, I will take that too. The author is a Columbia College sophomore."
491,"Hamilton Award goes to 'pioneer' Recipient, family honored for legacy",20 November 2009,"Recipient, family honored for legacyBY BETSY MORAIS Spectator Senior Staff WriterWhen his daughter Stephanie got into Columbia, Conrad Lung, CC '72, bet she couldn't beat his grade point average. At Thursday night's Alexander Hamilton Award Dinner, she introduced him as the honoree by saying that upon her graduation in 2004, ""I was very happy to parade, in his face, my higher GPA."" Her father attributed this to grade inflation. ""It is the kind of thinking that characterizes people molded by the Core Curriculum,"" she explained of his response, ""in which each person thinks he is right and everyone else is wrong."" A round of hearty, knowing laughter filled Low Rotunda. Yet the evening of flowing wine, halibut, and pastries swelled with warm appreciation for Lung, whose roles at Columbia have included founding president of the Asian Columbia Alumni Association, member of the Columbia College Alumni Association Board of Directors, and emeritus member of the Columbia College Board of Visitors. ""You have always been a pioneer,"" University President Lee Bollinger said in his speech to Lung, adding, ""You saw a world before the age of globalization became a mantra for all of us."" This vision, Bollinger and others noted, has been instrumental in shaping Columbia's fledgling identity as a global university, especially for Asian American studies. In accepting Columbia College's highest honor, the Hamilton Award ""for distinguished service""in any field by an alumnus or faculty member, Lung interpreted his path to achievement through a text he read early on in Literature Humanities. The Odyssey, the story of a journey home, is also the passage to self-real-ization. Lung's story traverses continents to reach this end. ""Instead of being hopelessly lost, he found himself at his destination, a different man,"" Lung explained. He was born in 1949 in Canton, China, a nation ravaged by foreign occupation and civil war. Even at the ageof seven, he described his life as ""precarious,"" after his family was split apart, then reunited, and he had to work in the afternoons to help support them. In 1968, his life was changed by an ""unexpected event,"" he said. The same year as the University's notorious riots in Morningside Heights, Lung received a thin envelope at his address in China. He expected he had been rejected based on the size of the letter, but he was indeed accepted, and offered a campus job that would essentially pay for college. His reaction was not so much joy as ""disbelief and incomprehension,"" he told the crowd41 years later. As an undergraduate, he met his future wife, Yin Lee Lung, BC '74. Two of his sisters later went on to attend Barnard, his brother attended Columbia, and all three of his children followed in his footsteps on campus. His daughter Stephanie, now president of the Columbia College Young Alumni Association, said, ""I've always felt that Columbia was my first family."" Thursday evening was a fundraising event for Columbia with around 400 guests —some from China and Singapore. Ken Catandella, executive director of the Columbia College Office of Alumni Affairs andDevelopment, said it was a success, though when asked how much money was raised for the night, he said, ""I have no idea yet."" Dean of Columbia College and Vice President for Undergraduate Education Michele Moody-Adams remarked on the turnout of students, who comprised about 100 of the swanky crowd. Catandella explained that these students were invited as guests of Lung, as well as representatives of student groups, and got to enjoy the evening free of charge. By the end, all rose to give Lung a standing ovation. news@columbiaspectator.comHONORS I Hamilton Award winner Conrad Lung, CC '72 , described his journey from war-torn China to the steps of Low.

492,Book vendors take Mside literary scene to the streets,27 January 2010,"BY ERICA WEAVER Columbia Daily SpectatorBOOKSAs the intellectual hub for Columbia students, Morningside Heights exudes amore academic vibe than other Manhattan neighborhoods. Beyond the Columbia bookstore and its independent counterparts, reading material abounds along the stretch of Broadway from 113 th to 110 th streets, where vendors have set up tables reminiscent of the Left Bank bookstands in Paris. Columbians and Morningside residents alike can stop by the table in front of Milano Market between 113 th and 112 th streets to peruse a picturesque table of books and CDs while chatting about politics and the death of print media with the owner, Steve, who prefers not to give his last name. He has been selling books for five years and can be spotted in a hunting hat reminiscent of Holden Caulfield. Although he prefers science fiction, Steve sells a little bit of everything, getting his books at sales and auctions as well as through donations. As Steve explains, he loves selling books because it gives him the chance to do something he enjoys while preserving time to write. However, he has definitely noticed some disturbing trends in the last few years. ""You can see howAmerican literacy has gone downhill by looking at how the Times' best-seller list has changed in the last 10 to 15 years,"" Steve said. Fortunately for Morningside residents, authors from Sophocles and Strindberg to Lorca and Golding still await at reasonable prices on Steve's table."" Only a few feet away from Steve's collection of current fiction and classics is the book table in front of Cardomat. Although the owner was not available for an interview, the table boasted an interesting juxtaposition of Mapplethorpe art books and D.H. Lawrence texts. There is usually a chess match at the sidewalk table a few feet away as well, increasing theintellectual atmosphere along this stretch of Broadway. Larry Kaplan is another book vendor who mans a table on the sidewalk near Duane Reade. Kaplan, who sports a mustache and a black beret, has been selling books for over 20 years and possesses a wealth of knowledge about everything from specific publishing houses to general literary trends. Kaplan started out working in flea markets, but when a library came up for sale, he decided to buy it. Kaplan said, ""I didn't know what I had, didn't know literature as well as I do now."" Nevertheless, he filled up the back of his truck and switched to the book business. Now, anyone in the marketfor an Italian copy of Marquez's ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" can find it at Kaplan's table, along with an assortment of out-of-print books, light reading, texts from Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, and even three or four collections of Harold Pinter plays. Kaplan offers vintage prints for $5 —these generally sell better than the books do. ""I've never seen a bad book, but I've seen many that don't sell,"" Kaplan said. He explained that usually the book vendors hope for immediate turnover and rely on a book's publication date to gauge whether or not it is current enough to appeal to buyers. Finally, just off Broadway on 111 th St., Raul sells everything from children's books and dictionaries to gloves and winter hats. Raul has been in the book industry for over 30 years and used to own a bookstore on 114 th, where Book Culture just opened a new location. He enjoys managing a table, but is also thinking about opening a children's bookstore. Even now, Raul noted that many of his older customers are most excited to pick up a copy of a Dr. Seuss favorite. In regard to the past few decades of neighborhood changes, Raul joked, ""We're still around. They haven't kicked us out.yet."" And, for the sake of the neighborhood's literary culture, hopefully ""they"" never will.SELLING IT I Tables along Broadway are an offbeat source for a variety of books—offerings range from current novels to beloved classics."
493,Lost In Translation seamus heaney speaks on the surprisingly creative art of translating,28 January 2010,"seamus heaney speaks on the surprisingly creative art of translatingby Tucker KumanILLUSTRATIONS BY CARY DUNNante, Descartes, Dostoevsky— they are all authors we read as part of our Core Curriculum, but more specifically, they are just a few of the authors that we read in translation. Although much of our Core Curriculum relies heavily on translated texts, the role of the translator is hardly examined—and understandably so. Unless a whole class speaks, say, fluent Spanish, it is impossible to fully dissect Edith Grossman's translation of ""Don Quixote."" Seamus Heaney, a Nobel-laureate poet, has dealt with the thorny issues of translation firsthand. After reading Robert Henryson's ""The Testament of Cresseid"" and ""Seven Fables"", written in Middle Scot, he was struck with ""an urge to get it into [his] own words"" and translate it into English. ""Fundamentally, I was operating on what Wordsworth called the grand elementary principle of pleasure. I loved the combination of the somber and the sympathetic in the Henryson voice,"" he says. He describes the process of translating the two works, both of which were published this past October. ""What's unique about translation,"" he relates, ""is the fact that you don't have to find the makings of the thing for yourself. They're already there in, as it were, kit-form. You don't sit down to a blank page, you have to match up rather than make up."" However, the translation of a liter-ary work, especially the translation of poetry, is not just a simple replication of literal words, a tracing of the elements and sounds. There is also to be considered what is lost in translation. In such cases, the translator must bring his or her own voice and judgment to sew up the seams that inevitably exist between different languages. ""In many passages I was able to keep the word for word order and the same rhymes. But that was by no means always possible, and in fact, the more 1 trampolined off the original the more I enjoyed the job,"" he says. ""Doing a stanza of one of those fables—it's like being a kid again, inflating a leather football. You'd pump it up so tight that it seemed to get lighter, then you'd lace it and bounce it hard and quick and be delighted by the sheer buoyancy and trimness. It was that kind of satisfaction, stanza by stanza, that kept me going with the fables."" In ""Cresseid,"" Heaney's phrasing and locutions smooth out awkward phrases and anachronisms as any good translation should, but further demonstrate a blunt - ness and vividness of expression that is reminiscent of his own poetry. Heaney's vivid language often evokes a strong engagement of both the abstract and the earthy, such as his yoking of physical labor with intellectual thought in his poem ""Digging."" Even in ""Cresseid's"" most simplistic couplets, Heaney's keen poetic sense shines through. At a crucial moment in the poem when Cresseid, a beautiful Trojan woman exiled by her Greek lover, is punished by the gods after placing blame upon them. She weeps, ""All welth in eird, away as wind it weiris; / Be war, thairfoir, approchis near the hour: / Fortoun is hkkill quhen scho beginnis and steiris!"" Heaney's rendering shifts it to ""All wealth on earth is wind that flits and veers; / Beware therefore in time. Thehour draws close / And fate is fickle when she plies the shears."" He deftly balances Henryson's meaning and presentation by communicating ""Cresseid's"" sorrow while forming a rhyme that captures the work's original lyricism. Nevertheless, the alterations he makes, though subtle, are powerful. The characterization of wind is enlivened by both ""flits"" and ""veers,"" diction that is suggestive of its caprice and elusiveness. Furthermore, Heaney echoes the notion of time twice, with ""time and ""hour,"" strongly emphasizing its inexorable passing. His final insertion of the image of fate plying ""the shears"" is perhaps informed by vivid agricultural imagery, a common theme in his poetry, that recalls his childhood on a farm in County Derry, and is even evocative of Robert Penn Warren's Evening Hawk, ""His wing / Scythes down another day, his motion / Is that of the honed steel-edge, we hear / The crashless fall of stalks of Time."" Differences in translations are inevitable, necessitated by varying rules of grammar and limitations of vocabularies—highlighting why the translator, who must decide how to handle his or her ""infidelity,"" plays such a crucial role in determining the final shape of the texts we read. Constance Garnett, translator of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky among others, has been praised for her clear prose but also condemned for excising parts of the original author's work, behaving more like a play director heading a singular production than a craftsman transfusing words from one language into another. Translators are people, as fallible, fickle and temperamental as each one of us, susceptible to obstinacy, obsession arid error. They are interpreters much in the way of everyday readers, bringing a set of prescribed values to a text and unconsciously applying them. ""1 have been unfaithful to theoriginal,"" Patrick Marber writes in the introduction to his translation of August Strindberg's ""Miss Julie,"" ""but conscious that the infidelity might be an act of love."" How significant, then are the translator's changes? Does Heaney's voice augment or diminish that of Henryson's? Should we treat a translated text as the translator's work or the original author's? These are the questions that we must consider, and perhaps the ones that Heaney wants his readers to consider as well. In the publication of ""The Testament of Cresseid"" and ""Seven Fables,"" Henryson's Middle Scots and Heaney's modern English translation are presented side-by-side. Heaney is practically hiding in plain sight. Every divergence is visible. Though we can track Heaney and contest whether his poetic sentiment improves or detracts from Henryson's original, what is to be done in the case of Allen Mandelbaum's ""Dante""? Bantam Classics has supplied the original Italian verse of ""The Divine Comedy"" but how is it of any help if the reader cannot read Italian in the first place? However, it should be considered that gaps between an author's original intent and the final text we read also exist in works written in English. In one of Romeo and Juliet's most famous soliloquies, Juliet states, ""That which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet."" This very line is a patchwork of various quarto and folio sources strung together by an editor,not by the Bard himself. Shakespeare's plays might not have been as messy or as tedious to compile as, say, ""The Epic of Gilgamesh,"" but the process has been similarly haphazard, complicating the ""defmitiveness"" of the final text Clearly, it is more than just language that poses a barrier to translators; time periods matter as well.""I've done one of the 'Eclogues', but domesticated it,"" Heaney relates. ""Since then I've been having a go at Book VI of 'The Aeneid' and am more and more conscious of the distance and difference between that world and mind and ours. I believe I'm realizing that because I know enough Latin to arrive at the frontier of literal meaning but can only gaze across-into the heartland of deeper apprehension."" Even if Virgil originally wrote in Latin, students read his work through a prism invariably colored by the limits of not only their linguistic capacity, but also those of their culture and individualperception. And translations are also tinted in the same way, perhaps reflecting particular values that not everyone will share. This is not to suggest that the Core's translations are, by virtue of being translations, inaccurate and should thus be dismissed. It is always possible that the Core's chosen translation would not be your own, that the Dostoevsky we read isn't the ""right"" Dostoevsky for you (with all due respect to Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky). But at the core of the Columbia education is not simply the texts themselves, but what they convey. As Heaney says of the ""Fables,"" ""It is the stories that keep their charge and hold the interest of contemporary readers most."" ""Classical tragedy, Greek myths—they're like lines of longitude and latitude that help to locate us in history and consciousness,"" Heaney says. The texts of the Core hearken back to the very roots of human experience and perception. Literature Humanities stresses how these>works are transformed into a collaborative effort, a medley of perspectives that mesh and clash, not merely by the author, translator and editor, but also by your professor and classmates; the Core experience perhaps ought to be measured by how far other views take you and stretch your own. So maybe the spare elegance of Richmond Lattimore is a student's dry poetry, and if that student is you, consider giving Robert Fitzgerald a shot. And if Homer has intrigued you enough to search him out in another pen's rendering, then maybe Literature Humanities has done its job. 9"
494,Our uglily beautiful world,1 February 2010,"We live in a beautiful world. Or do we? Every day the evidence to the contrary seems to mount, and to make such a sweeping claim in the face of so much national and global adversity feels fatuous, even callous and perhaps cruel. What's so beauti-ful about natural disaster? What's so beautiful about the persistent threat of terrorism? What's so beautiful about persecution of minorities across the globe? What's so beautiful about a crumbling economy, a threatened environment, a climate system under attack, widespread poverty, and a world in disarray? Not much. It's a consternating world these days. But ""everyone recognizes beauty / only because of ugliness,"" claims the second verse of Jonathan Star's translation of the Tao Te Ching. Perhaps we can sift through our ugly world and, despite ourselves, despite everything, winnow out all the dross that defiles it. To find beauty where it cannot be found —it is a notion as old as literature itself. Why is it, we wonder in Literature Humanities, that Homer briefly leaves all the carnage and bloodshed of the Iliad and, in Book 18, embarks on ekphrasis, describing in exquisite poetry the intricate scene Hephaistos carves into Achilleus's shield? Why does Hephaistos carve two contrasting cities, one idyllic and the other fraught with ""Hate"" and ""Confusion"" and ""Death""? And why is it important that the shield be aesthetically pleasing?Perhaps if Murasaki Shikibu had read the Iliad, she could have given us the answer. Pursuing beauty universally was a way of life in 1 lth-century Heian court, in which Murasaki, who gave us The Tale of Genji, one of the world's oldest novels, was a lady. Genji is a curious (and gargantuan) text. For those of us not familiar with the ways of Heian Japan's haut monde, it's sometimes difficult to endure yet another passage describing Genji, the everlachrymose protagonist, crying again. But it's worthwhile to consider why he cries. Sometimes it's because of one of his femmes fatales, and other times it's because of another one of them. But every now and then, Genji, or another character in the text, cries for a different reason: beauty. Some sort of beauty—often something transient or melancholy, sometimes something literary, poetic, natural, sartorial, even olfactory—moves him to tears. In a contemporary culture where being moved to tears by beauty is a stock joke for comedy, it's difficult to identify with Genji. More familiar to us is the interaction between Michael and Dwight in an episode of the Office: when Michael makes fun of Dwight for crying during the movie Armageddon, Dwight defends himself, whining, ""Michael, I told you. That was because it was New Year's Eve, and it started to snow at exactly midnight."" We find that hilarious. But like Dwight, Genji would probably find that genuinely moving—there wouldn't be much comedic irony. And for Murasaki and Genji, of course Hephaistos would carve a beautiful shield, because if it isn't beautiful, then what's the point? That's what life's all about. True, there may be textual and biographical suggestions that Lady Murasaki was skeptical of or even fed up with her peers' and characters' splashy pursuits of pulchritude. But shestill represents a remarkable ethos of beauty throughout Japanese culture. For example, in Japanese tea ceremonies, the fukusa, the cloth the host punctiliously folds to purify utensils before preparing tea, is often designed to be just shy of a perfect square. The student of the Way of Tea must learn to discover beauty even in the imperfection of the cloth he or she uses. Now, I'm not implying that I want paper to be 8.4 by 12.1 inches. But the fukusa quietly calls for a view of beauty in quotidian life that remains difficult, but important, to grasp. I think there is something to be said for reinterpreting our lives and understanding them in terms of a perpetual and deliberate pursuit of beauty, recognizing that beauty isn't life's version of bonus points, but something with inherent worth, something worth pursuing. Our world may not be beautifbl yet, but perhaps to seeking out beauty in everyday life, like Genji does, will create it rather than create the mirage of it. Perhaps it's worth it to take a page out of Homer's book and, like Hephaistos, rebel against a sullied world With beauty, whatever that may mean to us. Perhaps we can even think about our classes as ultimately seeking to answer the fundamental question of how to create a beautiful world. We should be confident that we are capable of supplanting ugliness with beauty, that we can overcome the dualism between the crass and the comely that the Tao Te Ching describes. After all, our world has room for, and perhaps it even demands, some beauty. Amin Ghadimi is a Columbia College sophomore. He is the former Spectator editorial page editor.

495,Class increase for CC Deans confirm permanent shift,12 February 2010,"Deans confirm permanent shiftBY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Senior Staff WriterColumbia College confirmed on Thursday that it is permanently increasing its first year class size by 50, and administrators said they are working now to address the needs of a larger student body. For the class of 2013, Columbia College accepted 50 more first year students than it had in prior years, to create a class of roughly 1070 students, up from the previous norm of around 1020. And according to Kevin Shollenberger, the dean of student affairs, this increased class size will become the new standard, resulting in 200 more students entering the College over four years. The School of Engineering and Applied Science will not see any increases. The University wanted to ensure that the change in class size would not be problematic for students, Shollenberger said, adding that the decision was expedited because of the economy. Now, he confirmed, they ""are going to go forward with their plan"" to make this size permanent. Administrators did not comment on the specifics of the financial changes surrounding this increase. Michele MoodyAdams, the dean of Columbia College, said in an interview on Thursday morning of the financial implications, ""It depends. It's a very complicated calculus. It depends on who is in the class, what level of need they have or don't have."" Kathryn Yatrakis, the dean of academic affairs, said of the University's finances, ""I think we are faring better than some other universities but we have not escaped the economic situation."" She added that the University was able to go forward withcertain hirings while other peer institutions entirely halted. With the increase, administrators said they are currently discussing appropriate ways to address changing needs in housing, advising, and academics. Moody-Adams said, ""We are taking really seriously the need to do everything we can to ensure the quality of student experience."" She said the University's plan to decrease the ratio of advisors to students would not be affected. Yatrakis also said that they are committed to the 22 student limit per Core class. To accommodate the class of 2013, she said they added three sections of LiteratureHumanities and two sections of Art Humanities. They also raised the cap of 12 students for University Writing courses to 14, although Yatrakis said that only one section had 14 students this year while the average was 13. Despite next years large sophomore class, Yatrakis said that they do not think at this point that they need to increase the number of sections of Contemporary Civilization. ""We think there is enough spaces to accommodate individually one [student] per section, but we are going to monitor this very carefully,"" she said. The University has tried to monitor what courses sophomores tend to take, which Yatrakis described as""very difficult."" She also discussed the need to ""start migrating class schedules""to less normal times to create more possible classes for students to take. Right now, since classes are usually held only at certain times, class space quickly becomes an issue. ""One of our biggest challenges has less to do with the actual size of the incoming class but how much space we have to offer the courses that they take,"" Moody-Adams said. According to Shollenberger, financial aid will remain unaffected by the new class size. Scott Wright, vice president of student auxiliary and business services, said that to accommodate the second wave of additional students, the University will work on three major housing projects over the summer. In Harmony Hall, a space that was previously a superintendentsapartment, will be converted into undergraduate housing, which will generate room for five students. In Ruggles, seven singles will become doubles, adding seven new beds to the building. He said the change would be ""consistent throughout,"" by changing one single in seven different suites. And the largest change is in Mcßain, where the University will be ""converting and moving some walls in Mcßain"" to create 20 extra beds. For example, he said, two 300-square feet rooms will become three 200-square feet spaces. Additionally, some singles will be turned into doubles. Ultimately, Mcßain will have relatively few singles. It is uncertain whether these new spaces will be included in room selection, Wright said,adding, ""It may be assigned space later."" With around 60 empty beds at the start of fall semester this year, and the 32 additional beds from renovations, ""We believe we will have plenty to accommodate the now two year additional student base,"" Wright said. Wright also said that seniors and juniors who want singles will still be able to get them. But some students still expressed concern. Shana Yearwood, CC 'll, questioned the decision to add more students to an already crowded University. ""I feel like they're cramped for space as it is. ... I just feel bad for the freshmen who'll be crammed into doubles that used to be singles,"" Yearwood said. Last year, for the class of 2013,Housing Services converted Harmony Hall to undergraduate housing. In regards to the fourth year of additional students, Wright said that it is ""a little bit far in advance"" to discuss the changes. ""Every year there are changes to the number of living spaces Columbia is working with,"" Wright said, adding ""I don't know right now what the best options will be."" Other students said they were happy about the change. ""That's great,"" said Noam Prywes CC 'lO, who said he wasn't worried about crowding in houses or dorms, or resources being stretched thin. ""Maybe this'll make our acceptance more reasonable."" Leah Greenbaum contributed reporting. amber.tunnell @columbiaspectator.com"
496,IVORY TOWER OF BABEL,18 February 2010,"by Amin Ghadimicover illustration by Matteo MalinvernoA critical look at the language requirement,a critical look at the foreign language requirementby amin ghadimi illustrations by rebekah kim & daryl seitchikNo matter how you slice the Core, the language requirement is its largest component. Columbia College students race through the major works of Western literature in two semesters. They return the next year to survey Western philosophy from Plato to Woolf. Science awkwardly claims a year and a half of their time. Neither music nor art even merits a full year. And physical education feels like an afterthought. But foreign languages? They demand a full four semesters of concerted effort. And when you factor in the relative point values of different Core requirements, the weight assigned to the foreign language requirement becomes even greater: many introductory languagt courses are worth up to five points, demanding, at least in theory, almost twice the amount of work and dedication than demanded by a perfunctory, three-point Science for Non-Sci-entists lecture. Alas, there is no Language for Non-Linguists. Some Columbia College students are exempt from the requirement because of fluency in another language. Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science are altogether exempt. It's clear, nonetheless, that Columbia is serious about producing graduates who are multilingual. On a campus where everyone argues over everything, an impassioned debate over the foreign language requirement is conspicuously absent. If many students open fire on Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization for being Eurocentric, if some complain about University Writing and Frontiers of Science for being boring, if the rationale for a Core Curriculum itself comes under question, then the language requirement deserves a good dose of Columbia skepticism and argument. After all, there is much to be skeptical about, so much to argue over. Throughout the Sisyphean task of learning a language, how often do we consider why we are memorizing words and mastering sentence constructions? We may grumble about our choice of language in moments of frustration at 3:00 a.m., but how often do we genuinely second-guess our decisions? Paralyzed by Choice The existence of such a requirement brings to the forefront a looming decision: which languages do Columbia students choose to study? For many of us, it's not an easy choice. There is a troubling tension between what's useful and what's interesting, what's timeless and what's trendy, what's easy and what's daring. Before even the choice is made, explains professor Stephane Charitos, director of Columbia's Language Resource Center, there is the problem of limited knowledge. While Columbia students may think they're choose language based on preference, they may not have the necessary information to make a knowledgeable choice—that is, they may not know of the variety of language options Columbia offers. ""Students naturally gravitate toward a [certain] language department because they don't know any better,"" he says. Choosing between Columbia's 45 to 55 offered languages, the majority of which Charitos describes as ""less-commonly-known,"" is all too frequently not given the attention of, say, choosing a major. Many of these ""less-commonly-taught languages"" find a home in the Language Resource Center. Tucked away in a corner of the School of International and Public Affairs, the LRC, founded in 1998 with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, was inaugurated as a way to promote language studies at Columbia. Currently, the LRC offers undergraduates opportunities to learn several less-commonly-taught languages, including Punjabi, Bengali, and Hausa.""The LRC is a place where the languages are nurtured and gro'wn,"" he explains, describing it in a later correspondence as an ""incubator"" for languages. Vietnamese, for example, began as an LRC-sponsored language program, but as it grew and expanded, it was passed on to the East Asian languages and cultures department. The entire world, though, seems to run on a few core languages. The United Nations has only sixofficial languages, and the number of people who actually speak, say, Finnish, is negligible on a global scale. When this is the case, can anyone really blame students for choosing languages that actually have a significant place on the global stage? In this way, the domain of choosing which language to study is a battleground of pedagogical philosophies, personal passions, and national interests. And it's an important one. ""This is nota decision you make on Monday and, two years later, you change to another language. You need to think through why you're taking a language,"" Charitos says. So how to decide? For Mark Hay, a Columbia College sophomore, the choice to study Hindi-Urdu was as much a visceral choice as an intellectual one. ""I'm an Indophile,"" he says in an email interview. ""I love the culture, the politics fascinate me, my religious tradition of choice originates from the region, and the holy texts I read and ascribe to are related in script and in spirit and in basic structure to this language."" Hay's mantra for how to choose a language is simple: ""Follow your bliss. Find the culture and the poetry and the heritage that speaks to you and pursue it out of passion and pure love."" In the October 2009 edition of Columbia Political Review , Hay wrote a biting attack on the increasing popularity of Mandarin and Arabic at Columbia and in the world, describing the trend as ""silly."" He posed a question: ""Is language study worth it—the hours in class stumbling through strange sounds, squiggly lines, the painful dialogues on your imaginary Chinese dating life and Arabic cooking habits—just to be momentarily fashionable?"" It seems that the response at Columbia has been a resounding ""yes."" According to professor Lening Liu, director of Columbia's Chinese Language Program, Columbia is at the fore of the rise of Mandarin. In 2002, there were around 200 people studying Chinese at Columbia. This year, there are between 480 to 490, he said, around 35 of whom are studying classical Chinese. That's almost a 150 percent increase in under 10 years. Professor Liu brushes aside criticisms of the possible transience of the popularity of studying Chinese. ""These days it's very hard to get anything done without China's involvement or cooperation,"" he says, referring to China's role in international affairs.That students would study Chinese for its utility makes sense to him. ""We realized the trend and we started early,"" he boasts. Six years ago, with an eye toward the vocational advantages of Chinese proficiency, the Chinese department began to offer advanced students the chance to specialize in media Chinese, legal Chinese, or business Chinese. Working in conjunction with the Business, Law, and International Affairs schools, it developed curricula tailored to individual career needs, a decision in which Liu takes pride. He goes on to explain how Columbia was the first Ivy to offer Business Chinese, Legal Chinese and Media Chinese. Such ebbs and flows in language preference are inevitable. Charitos explains that even if some view Arabic and Chinese as passing trends rather than global mainstays, China's huge"
497,Lecture tries to decipher Cervantes work,24 February 2010,"BY TIM BARKER Columbia Daily SpectatorEvery Literature Humanities class may discuss ""Don Quixote,"" but Miguel Cervantes thought a different book would be his masterpiece. That work, ""The Trials of Persiles and Sigisnrunda,"" was the topic of ""Writing the Outsider: Perspectives from Spain,"" a lecture presented Tuesday by Barnard's Center for Translation Studies. Sonia Velazquez, a doctoral candidate at Princeton University, used the text to explore Renaissance concepts of speech and barbarism. Using a slide presentation of antique dictionaries and period maps, Velazquez discussed a time when burgeoning globalization forced issues of language and foreignness to the forefront. ""Persiles and Sigismunda"" narrates journeys to unknown lands, inspired by the newly discovered Americas. This intercontinental scope allowed Cervantes to depict diverse groups of people and their languages, from Irish to Polish to Arabic. Cervantes' approach, Velazquez argued, departs from both classical and Renaissance conventions of writing about barbarian speech —for instance, in Homer's ""Odyssey' even the crass cyclops speaks intelligible Greek. Early modern writers usually presented unconventional speech as a sign of dubious character. Cervantes, however, embraced the roughness of exotic languages but questioned the connection between linguistic sophistication and moral quality. In an interview, Velazquez said, ""In his novels, he [Cervantes] depicts the melting Mediterranean world of people trying to communicate in a blend of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Turkish."" She praised Cervantes' ""humanity and sympathetic ear towards the Other,"" citing as an example his charitable attitude towards a Christian who feigned conversion to Islam in ""Don Quixote."" Velazquez stressed the relevance of translation to connect her lecture to the mission of the Center for Translation Studies. The CTS was founded in fall 2009, with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. It sponsors translation courses in addition to academic colloquia. ""I think it's great that Barnard has a center for translation,"" Velazquez said. Valezquez attributes a recent trend of such centers, including one founded at Princeton University in 2007, to a growing awareness ""that we live in a multilingual world, and that in order to be able to succeed in both a very material sense and also as human beings, we need to understand that language is very important.""BOOKS"
498,Survey explores CU paper use,26 February 2010,"BY EMILY KWONG Spectator Staff WriterImagine carrying your entire courseload —your textbooks, Literature Humanities books, and the readings you print daily off of Course Works—in the palm of your hand. This is exactly the kind of concept the Committee on Information and Communications Technology of the University Senate is hoping to explore. As of Feb. 11, the committee has been conducting an online university-wide survey to understand student's use of new technologies to access information. These new technologies include mobile devices, desktops, laptops, and e-readers—portable devices designed to replace printed material. ""We've noticed a paradigm shift,"" said Julia Hirschberg, professor of computer science and committee chair, at the Jan. 29 University Senate plenary. ""We get this in the New York Times everyday, recently with the iPad coming out —people are accessing documents through iPhones and e-readers. We want to know what peoples current usage patterns are and also what their requirements are for document processing."" As of Feb. 16, nearly 4000 surveys—which ask students about their habits for collecting information —had been completed, and more will continue to be accepted for another two weeks. ""Before we had a lot of anecdotal information, and now we're getting real data,"" Hirschberg said in a recent interview. Candace Fleming, committee member and Vice President of Information Technologies, said that this survey is responding to the demands of today's world. ""Everyone uses technology on an increasing scale on a daily basis,"" she wrote in an email. ""There are increasing expectations to be able to search for, access, and utilize information including reading materials online."" Though the focus of the survey is on the current needs and the interests of students and faculty, itsresults could one day prompt consideration of alternative forms of document access. ""We want Columbia to be able to formulate policies in the forefront of this paradigm shift, and not just be the last people to get on board with respect to publishing, IT, and possibility arrangements with technology providers,"" Hirschberg said. For Hatim Diab, also a committee member and Senior Staff Associate of the Center for Computational Learning Systems,the survey was cause for reflection. ""It just hit me how much printing we do at Columbia,"" he said. In 2009, the Columbia University Purchasing Department reports purchases of 157,326,500 sheets of paper, 314,653 reams, through a university-contracted paper supplier. This number does not account for paper bought independently by individual purchasers. ""I'm not sure how long we can sustain such volumes of printing,"" Diab said, speculating that a shift away from paper might be a future trend.""Sooner or later there must be a paradigm shift,"" Diab said. ""Man began writing on stone, that was the medium, then wood, papyrus, paper, and then printing paper. Now you have screens. Are screens the next thing? I don't know. Is it worth checking? Yes."" Other universities have already begun to test the feasibility of incorporating e-readers into the classroom. During the 2009 fall term, the Office of Information Technologies at Princeton University piloted the Kindle DX in a small number of classes. Their online reports, whichHirschberg said the committee had looked into, reveal that although paper consumption was reduced, ""the classroom experience was somewhat worsened, as study and reference habits of a lifetime were challenged by device limitations."" The study recommended that ereader manufacturers improve annotation tools, pagination, content organization, and develop a more ""paper-like"" user interface. Diab acknowledged that the implementation of a similar program at Columbia might be met with resistance.""A lot of people hate e-readers. Some people like paper. And we're definitely not going to get rid of paper altogether,"" he said, adding that the success of such a program would need the right technology. Maureen Stimola, CC 'l2, said that an e-reader device could be useful, but only to a certain extent. ""For classes with a breadth of texts, it might be easier to compile them on one device so you don't have dozens of books taking up shelf space. But with a text I'm planning to spend more time with, I like to have paper.""Though Diab acknowledged it would likely be several years before Columbia implemented any new policies, he said that the current survey research gives Columbia the opportunity to be a leader in paperless technology. ""If Columbia University is on its own, it does nothing. But if we can get other universities on board and they have the same vision, this could really be something,"" he said. emily.kwong @columbiaspectator.com"
499,Equal access to education,26 February 2010,"BY KATHLEEN SMITHEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome.As the rest of campus looks forward to spring break and the respite it offers, I begin to prepare for the semesterly rebirth of College Prep, the Community Impact course I co-teach with Professor Emeritus Robert W. Hanning, the course's originator. College Prep is a six-week-long seminar that professor Hanning and I offer local members of the New York City community who are either preparing for or have recently attained the GED. We emphasize written and oral presentation in order to better acclimate our students to the demands of college-level work. Most students come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and often left high school under the most difficult of circumstances. Their teenage years are often beset by the hardships of violence, gangs, drugs, alcohol, teenage pregnancy, sexual assault, and jail time. One of the driving goals of our course is to empower our students to move beyond their past by giving them the skills to succeed in college. We work to shape their personal experiences intoa compelling narrative —a written life story of the challenges they have faced and the obstacles they have overcome. From this narrative emerge the seeds of their college admissions essays, giving them a head start on the most important part of their applications. As we renew our commitment to the local community this year, the program is being reborn in new and exciting ways: Community Impact has introduced a mentoring program for our students. Each GED student is assigned a mentor from the School of General Studies. A significant body of research suggests that GED attrition rates may be improved by the presence of a social support system —the mentors provide that social counterpart to the work that Professor Hanning and I do in the classroom. With work and family obligations pulling them in different directions, our students find themselves both overwhelmed and isolated—college seems like a distant dream, divorced from the reality of their everyday lives. By pairing our GED students with GS mentors who often come from similar socioeconomic backgrounds and who have frequently overcome similar life obstacles, college suddenly becomes a plausible reality —both in the classroom and the mentor meetings, our students are reminded of the possibility of a different kind of life.We feel that the combination of College Prep and the mentoring program will put more of our students on the path to college and a degree. And we have good reasons for this bright forecast. Last semester, we had our lowest attrition rate in years, and our brightest and most energetic group of GED students in memory. This semester the program expands even further, with a new section of the course being offered by professor David Carr of Union Theological Seminary. The program is growing, and with the expansion, we will be able to reach, prepare, and encourage even more students for futures as college graduates. As a Teaching Fellow in the Core, I have never doubted that higher education has the capacity to transform and to inspire, and ultimately to create better citizens. Our student body at Columbia, however, represents an admittedly narrow segment of the national population. Higher education remains a luxury of the elite, with the upper and upper-middle classes making up the majority of the national student population. For this reason, the mentoring program and the work of Community Impact are essential to the idea of Columbia as a whole. If we believe in education as one of the most powerful forces of a democracy, and if we unite as students and as teachers inthat belief, we must then be committed to its dissemination-to all levels of society. My students in Literature Humanities have been thinking about the differences between moral thought and moral action for almost a year now, and have debated the role of the heroic ideals and glory in Homer, the call to duty and nation in Virgil, and the commitment to the life of mind and spirit in Augustine and Dante. But regardless of our diverse beliefs and backgrounds, as a community, education is the value that unites us —it is a value we share by choosing to be at Columbia and by participating in university life. We must then move beyond the gates of 116 th Street and dive headlong into the city, with Virgil, Dante's Beatrice, and professor Hanning as our mentors and guides. Another kind of education awaits us, and through our work, a better democracy. At Community Impact and in College Prep, we strive to live this ideal in our own small way, hoping to impact and improve individual lives if we are at all able. I invite you to join us in our endeavor. New York City and Community Impact await you. The author is a Ph.D. candidate in the department of English and comparative literature.

500,"Global Core for our ""global community""",12 April 2010,"This Monday, Shock and Awe's Sarah Leonard and Kate Redburn present guest columnist Kassandra Lee on the important questions to consider when evaluating the objectives of the Global Core requirement. Yesterday, I attended a meeting about the Global Core sponsored by the Columbia College Student Council (our lovely student government). The.faculty members present were Roosevelt Montas, the director of the Center for the Core Curriculum, and Patricia Grieve, chair of the Committee on the Global Core. It was an opportunity for students to discuss concerns about the Global Core and understand the objectives from the designers of the requirement. One of the ways they imagine the Global Core moving forward is to have team-taught, interdisciplinary courses focused on primary texts, which would be more like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. But, of course, like everything at Columbia, the recent economic crisis has ""put a strain on resources"" across departments in the humanities and the social sciences. Professor Montas made a point that the Global Core represents two necessary aspects of an education that might be left out of the rest of the Core: exposure to other cultures and exposure to non-En-lightenment-based theoretical paradigms. Both faculty members seemed to hope that the Global Core would successfully explore both of these objectives. The other students present offered their views and experiences with the Global Core. Their opinions seemed to be mixed about almost all aspects of the requirement: should the classes be seminars or lectures? Should they rely on a great books model? One student even suggested that we have a ""Frontiers of Culture"" class similar to the design of Frontiers of Science. I asked a question about the focus on ""culture"" and the role of Columbia's Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race in the change from Major Cultures to Global Core. Grieve then asked which Global Core classes I had taken and asked a follow-up question about how I liked the class Introduction to Comparative Ethnic Studies, to which I replied that it was one of my favorite classes here. Grieve answered that if a class is about a group in* the United States or Europe (""Western"") that has enough maintenance of cultural ties with the ""parent,"" culture then it could be a Global Core class (Asian-American Literature would be an example). Another possibility would be that the Committee for the Global Core may ask a professor to add more books from underrepresented regionsto the syllabus if the class seems close to meeting the Global Core requirements. In this way, professors would have the opportunity to expand their interests as well. Overall, the faculty members were receptive and engaged with what the students had to say. So hopefully there will be more discussions about the Global Core and the Core in general in which students' opinions can be taken seriously. Personally, I worry about ""engagement with other cultures"" as the dominant raison-detre of the Global Core since it erases some of the other organizing factors of the CC/Lit Hum syllabus that aren't simply related to culture. One of the other students mentioned that the Global Core seems like a catch-all for all that is left out of the Core, and I think it's a tragedy to think that the only communities, people, and paradigms ignored by the CC/Lit Hum courses are those that originate in non-Western regions. If we simply look to engage with cultures that are ""non-West-ern,"" do we erase the existence of groups that have operated within ""Western"" paradigms? Is W.E.B. Dußois the only AfricanAmerican deemed worthy enough for the Core to care about? Did people who are not white nor male never ""contribute"" to ""our society""?This brings me to another point: how are the complex experiences of people and communities that operate and have operated in the West going to be included in the Core? The presentation of the Core is a political statement of what has been and must continue to be the important genealogies of culture, political theory, philosophy, and morals in the ""West."" The Global Core attempts to show what's going on in ""the rest of the world"" with ""other"" cultures, but what about the philosophy, political theory, music, and daily existences that challenge the very coherency of ""Western Civilization"" that the Core puts forth? Should we (or they) even be fighting for inclusion in the political statement the Core makes? This sort of approach could not be acted out through the inclusion of more texts but would precipitate a total revaluation and radical restructuring of our dearly beloved Core. When I used to work in the Alumni Calling Center, alumni always loved to hear about my encounters with Plato and Aristotle before deciding to whip out their credit cards to help donate to the school. These are the material incentives that demand that we maintain the ideological objectives of our Core Curriculum. This week's Shock and Awe guest columnist, Kassandra Lee, is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in comparative literature and society.

501,When the real learning happens,26 April 2010,"BY ISADORA CERULLOAs the academic year comes to an end, one thing on everyone's (read: my) mind is: What should I be doing with my summer? I do already have plans to come back to the city to conduct research from June to August, but questions remain. Am I spending this time wisely? Should I be taking time off, relishing the few months I have with friends and family? Will I enjoy myself, or can I be doing something more fun? Is this worth the other opportunities and plans I'm turning down? And, of course, what if I don't have enough time to watch the World Cup? Every time I ask my friends and fellow Columbians how they plan to spend their summers, I'm (always impressed with their motivation and curiosity. One is WWOOFing (working for the World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) in France and then returning to a fashion internship in Paris. Several(including me) are participating in science research in neurobiology and pathology labs. Several others are taking the opportunity to travel inside and outside the United States. And, of course, there are still others who will be staying in the city while others will return home to relax or work and spend time with friends and family. Jobs, service opportunities, classes, and trips are all on the agenda. In all of these plans, I get the same sense of an underlying, unspoken significance of this time of year (especially as students at a school like Columbia). For one thing, summer is a time specifically for us. Certain moments of the past academic year have definitely felt like a whirlwind. Part of me cannot believe how fast the time has flown by and that my first year of college is already coming to an end. As everyone says, I better be enjoying it and making the best of it because it'll be over before I know it. How do I know I'mdoing this whole experience correctly? And how do I put to best possible use the months of unstructured, free, filled-with-potential time that are summers? Perhaps my view will change as I'm exposed to more, but I feel like this is the time to do exactly what I want: to be productive, to enjoy every moment, to push myself. Summer is when the real learning can take place. What do I mean by that—""real learning?"" It's incredibly easy to get caught up in the intensity of an Ivy League education, the Core Curriculum, and the immense pressure to keep up with outstandingly intelligent peers. Time during the semesters, it seems, is planned out according to assignment due dates. As a result, I constantly struggle with how I approach my studies and the material presented in the courses I take. I do/ft think it is enough to study simply to attain a grade. I try to grapple with concepts, themes, and questions inorder to arrive at some sort of knowledge that can be applied outside of the academic context in which they are presented. But therein lies the problem. We have so much material to cover in all our classes that I find myself plowing from topic to topic, text to text, with evenly spaced (or not) assessments along the way. The connecting what I've supposedly learned to real life and real-time circumstances is forgotten. And I think this is what I find so appealing about summer. It's during these months that I can try to take what I've been exposed to in the classroom and realize the potential of this knowledge beyond academia. The questions that present themselves in the texts we read in Literature Humanities, and even in some of the material in University Writing, are questions that have been asked and will continue to be asked by humanity in relation to those texts but also in circumstances we can all relate to. While I am here at Columbia, I know I am (and will be) very well-schooled. But I hope to come away having learned well, too. Education cannot simply be cultivated within the physical location of a classroom. And during this summer I will try to realize just that. The author is a Columbia College first-year.It's during these months that I can try to take what I've been exposed to in the classroom and realize the potential of this knowledge beyond academia."
502,"New deans, new academics",10 May 2010,"BY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Senior Staff WriterAs new administrators settle into their positions, this year was the transition period that followed months—and in some cases years—of administrative searches. While Columbia's new dean and provost continue to shape their roles on campus, the undergraduate pool expanded with the economy —and a changing market pushed the Journalism School to also expand its areas of research. In an adjustment year for Columbia, departments renamed and re-alligned, as the University promoted the sciences, new media, and updated curricula. ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES After extensive and highprofile administrative searches that dragged through last year, Columbia experienced a transition period as new appointments settled into their roles. After Austin Quigley stepped down as Columbia College dean last year, Michele Moody-Adams—who was then vice provost for undergraduate education at Cornell University—became the first woman and the first African American to hold the post. Over the past year, she has become known to undergraduates for her philosophy lectures and her tea parties, similar to University President Lee Bollinger's fireside chats. And after a search that spanned two years, civil engineer Feniosky Pena-Mora—-formerly the associate provost of the University ofIllinois —was appointed dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Social psychologist Claude Steele took his place as provost, also becoming the first African American to hold the post. At the time, Steele was the Lucie Stern Professor in the Social Sciences at Stanford University and director of Stanford's Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. As for Steele, his style as provost is still in its formative stages. In recent interviews, Steele has suggested that he would like to take a more active role in budgeting. His predecessor, historian and former provost Alan Brinkley, saw control over budgetary decisions shift from the provost to the president and the newly created position of the senior executive vice president. MORE STUDENTS AND THE COMMON APP In February, the University announced that it would be increasing Columbia College's first-year class size permanently by 50 students to roughly 1,070 students per year, up from the previous of around 1,020 —a decision expedited by the economy, dean of student affairs Kevin Shollenberger said at the time. Last year's admission cycle, for the class of 2013, marked the first year of this increase. After reviewing how the change had affected the University initially, administrators decided to make it permanent. This will result in a total of 200 more students on campus after the first four years. Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that administrators had to make slight adjustments to Core Curriculum classes this past year to accommodate the larger freshman class. They added three sections of Literature Humanities and two sections of Art Humanities. They also raised the cap for University Writing courses from 12 students to 14, although Yatrakis said that only 'one section had 14 students this year, and the average was 13. She said that she did not foresee any changes being made for the Contemporary Civilization courses next year. . This year's admitted class was again the most selective in history, with a combined CC and SEAS admit rate of 9.16 percent. This is the last class that will be admitted through Columbia's unique application— beginning next year, Columbia will start using the Common Application instead. ""We offer one of the most generous need-based financial aid programs in the country and believe the Common Application will make applying to Columbia more accessible to students from every background,"" Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jessica Marinaccio wrote in a statement released in March. EXPANDING SCIENCE, CONFLICTING INTERESTS While student reaction to the required Frontiers of Science class has been notoriously mixed in the course's five-year run, this year the administration ensured that it would continue by renewing the course. The science department at Columbia also expanded this year, as construction continued on the Northwest Corner Building, located at the corner of 120 th Street and Broadway. Eight Columbia scientists were selected this past year to move into the new building, which will mainly consist of department laboratories. The University also plans to hire 13 new scientists, which makes a total of 21 scientists moving into the building. Kenneth Shepard from the electrical engineering department said in January that his new space will be significantly larger than his current space, which is cramped and crowded. He also said the Northwest Corner Building should ""help to create a lot of synergy between the physical sciences and life sciences"" at Columbia. But the future is not bright for all scientists at Columbia.This fall, some astronomers who occupy the neighboring Pupin Physics Laboratory said the layout of the new building has blocked out one-ninth of the night sky from the telescopes in the Rutherford Observatory. ""It's a shame,"" David Hirsh, the University's executive vice president for research, said in January. ""This is something that has been a problem all along, and we just have to face this problem."" The telescopes are used for both teaching and research, and some who use them have added that the light from the new building will prevent clear observation. NEW MEDIA FOR THE TIMES Columbia's Journalism School has also seen an expansion this year in an effort to boost research on new forms of media. In January, the J-School completed the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, and in April, it added a dual degree program in conjunction with SEAS for students interested in digital journalism. ""We've been moving in a digital direction very rapidly these past few years, and we'd like to keep moving and be a recognized leader in teaching digital journalism to students,"" Nicholas Lemann, dean of the Journalism School, said in January. In 2008, the Tow Foundation gave a $5 million gift to the J-School to found the digital media center, with the stipulation that Columbia raise an additional $lO million in two years. After the fundraising was completed this year, searches for a director began, and in April the position was given to Emily Bell, who plans to leave her post at The Guardian and start this summer. In April, the University Senate passed a proposal to implement a ""Dual Master of Science Degree in Journalism and Computer Science"" between the J-School and SEAS, and the University hopes to launch it in fall 2011. The program is slated to have a specialized digital journalism curriculum. ""This was not a hard sale among our faculty or the faculty in the Senate,"" said Bill Grueskin, dean of academic affairs for the Journalism School, referring to the pressing need for a program like this amid the changing atmosphere of journalism. Shehrbano Saiyid, Journalism 'lO and specializing in broadcast, said in April that the J-School's focus is in flux. ""Old forms of journalism are going out,"" she said. ""The Journalism School is trying to make the students realize that it's a part of our success to better know the Internet and digital media."" NAME CHANGES, NEW MAJORS, AND NEW APPLICATIONS Columbia's Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures department (MEALAC) capped off what chair Sudipta Kaviraj said has been gradual curricular changes with a new moniker—Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies (MESAAS). The department has expanded to include South Asian and African courses, Kaviraj said, and has shifted from a focus on languages, cultures, and literacy studies to study of the history and social sciences of these regions. In March, the Earth Institute, CC, and the School of General Studies announced that they will offer a major in sustainable development to undergraduates. Students already had the option of concentrating in sustainable development, and the high level of interest in the concentration spurred the University to develop a full major, according to the Earth Institute's website. Also in March, administrators for the creative writing program offered through the School of the Arts for CC undergraduates announced that, as of fall 2010, the program will require an application, which will include a substantial writing sample. amber.tunnell @columbiaspectator.com"
503,ARIANNE RICHARD COLUMBIA COLLEGE,18 May 2010,"While a campus tradition holds that the first person in each incoming class to find the owl carved into the Alma Mater statue will be valedictorian, Arianne Richard didn't even look for it. To this day, she hasn't seen the owl—but she was named Columbia College valedictorian regardless. Richard, a biochemistry major, said she found out that she was valedictorian while sitting in a computer lab in the chemistry department. ""I opened my email and I just started laughing. So I ended up in the stairwell, laughing and calling everybody I knew,"" she said. Her mother, Lisa Richard, wrote in an email, ""As well as I know her, she still continues to amaze me with her determination and capacity to learn."" With a GPA of 4.16, Richard said she previously had no idea where she stood academically in her class. She also received the award for the highest GPA —an honor that does not always go to the valedictorian, who is selected by a committee based on a number of factors in addition to grades. While Richard has focused on science during her time at Columbia, she said she decided to attend partly because of the Core Curriculum. She named Elizabeth Scharffenberger, a lecturer in the classics department and her Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization professor, as one of her favorite professors. ""Arianne's enthusiasm for the projects of Lit Hum and CC —her lively curiosity and breadth of interests, as well as her generosity of spirit andgood will toward others—are what I will always remember and appreciate about her,"" Scharffenberger wrote in an email, adding that Richard also has ""an absolutely fantastic sense of humor."" After graduation, Richard has a one-year position lined up with the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and her research adviser—Ruben Gonzalez, an assistant professor in the chemistry department —convinced her to apply to a biophysics Ph.D. program in the fall. As a junior, she was awarded a Goldwater Scholarship, the most prestigious prize for undergraduates planning to pursue Ph.D.s in science or math. After school, she would like to either stay in academia or go into manuscript editing for a science publication. Brent Stockwell, an associate professor in the biology department and Richard's major adviser, taught her in a graduate-level genomics class, which Richard took in her junior year. ""I was a little skeptical [of her age] going in,"" he admitted, but ""she was amazing in the class. She was right up in the thick of things with the graduate students."" Stockwell added, ""Of all the students, not only was she tremendously impressive in all her classes, but she was understated. She would never ask to be valedictorian."" Richard said one of her best memories at Columbia is from when she attended the Lenfest Awards banquet —an event to honor committed professors—a few weeks ago, when Gonzalez was getting an award. Shesat next to Martin Chalfie, chair of the biology department and a co-recipient of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. ""He immediately asked me what I do, what I wanted to do,"" Richard said. ""He started listing off names of who he would contact for me in Boston. ... He followed through with everything. He set me up with interviews in Boston without ever having me as a student."" On campus, Richard has been involved in dance groups, including serving as co-chair of CU Dance Marathon, an annual fundraiser for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The event lasts 28 hours, and last year, it raised over $51,000. Alex Marchyshyn, CC 'lO, described Richard as ""fun, determined, and loyal."" ""She is always game for an adventure, whether it is pursuing gluten-free mac and cheese downtown or trying something we never have before,"" Marchyshyn added. Richard also works in a laboratory part-time. She said the research she has done with a graduate student is now ready to be published, and hopefully will be by fall. Her mother said that she seems to have inherited her enthusiasm for science from her father, Marc Richard, who is an electrical engineer. ""He began doing home experiments with her when she was three or four years old,"" she said, ""answering her questions with patience and allowing her to improvise to 'see what happens if...."" —Amber Tunnell"
504,How to survive the Core and enjoy it too,30 August 2010,"BY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Senior Staff WriterLove it or hate it, there's nothing in the Columbia experience that quite compares to the Core Curriculum. The Core unites students in Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science with a common learning experience, albeit one with endless reading lists and discussion posts. Whether you sleep with ""The Iliad"" under your pillow or have long since chucked it out the window, the Core defines the University's mission to cultivate critical thinking in undergraduates. Here are some universal maxims (Kant, anyone?) for making your way through: 1. Tailor the classes to your interests. In many courses, you can choose your own essay topics. Love Jane Austen but hate Virginia Woolf? If you go withwhat you like, you'll make even your least favorite Core class more palatable. 2. Instructors are key. A good one can make you love a course, while a bad one can have you running for the hills within a week. When possible, use CULPA (www.culpa.info) to pick the professors that are right for you. Remember, though, that different students look for different traits in professors—you might actually love a professor who got poor reviews on CULPA. Also keep in mind that a good instructor can come from anywhere: Your favorite teacher may end up being a graduate student, while the class taught by that award-winning professor might turn out to be a bust. Look at the amount of time they have for each of their students and how much they are willing to work with students, and don't make judgments solely based on a professor's field. Many Coreprofessors come from different departments. Even if your professor has only ever taught Italian, she could still be an insightful Literature Humanities professor. 3. Take Core classes that contribute to your major. A Global Core course or a class that fulfills the science requirement might force you to explore a different aspect of your major than you normally would have—and you have to graduate sometime, after all. 4. Read selectively. Even instructors will admit that you can't read everything, and certain portions of the texts provide greater insight than others. The Core is the one part of the curriculum that is uniquely, well, Columbian. Whatever you feel about it, know that every single student around you has to get through the Core for his or her diploma. It is the tie that binds us together as Columbia students."
505,"Textbook buying 101 A rundown of coursebook options and costs New semester, new books, new ways to save dough",30 August 2010,"New semester, new books, new ways to save doughBY CLAIRE FU AND MELISSA VON MAYRHAUSER Columbia Daily SpectatorA requirement-heavy Core Curriculum means many things, but for the average student on a budget, it mostly means a big headache over where and how to acquire all the readings. Weighing the many options for book-buying in advance can save students lots of time and money during the first week back, when both are in high demand. The Columbia University Bookstore—also known as the Barnes & Noble in the basement of Lerner Hall—allows students to purchase used and new books. Students may sell these back at the end of the semester for a fraction of the original price—like $0.50 for some used Lit Hum books. This year, some books may have a ""rent"" sticker on their covers, allowing students to save up to half the cost and return the books after classes end. Unlike other local options, the CU Bookstore's selection is a cookie-cutter survey of course reading materials, which is to be expected of an official campus bookstore. Yet while the cement storeroom where students find course books may be lacking in charm, it holds a thorough supply of texts at reasonable prices—enough to win over the dealhunting student. Book Culture—an independent store brimming with intellectual reading materials—has locations on 112 th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam and on Broadway at 114 th Street. Course books can be found at the original location on 112 th. This Morningside Heights literary staple pays homage to its academic neighbor to the north, offering rare and out-of-print books, foreign-language titles, and other arts and humanities works. It also works directly with many professors to supply books for their classes. While Book Culture does provide bargain titles—and owner Chris Doeblin said it prices texts below Barnes & Noble costs—there are far fewer money-saving options here than there are in the CU Bookstore, with its large selection of used texts and box sets. But if students are captivated by the allure of the indie store and the idea of wandering past shelves piled with everything from French comic books to art deco encyclopedias, the added cost may be worth it. Of course, students can also buy required texts without leaving their dorm rooms. Half.com—an online marketplace reminiscent of its parent companyeßay, only with millions of used and new books—offers drastically reduced prices, often more than half off. Search engines such as campusbooks.com and bigwords. com do all the work for you by scanning the Internet for the best prices. Although these websites boast comprehensive and cheap book selections, students should make sure they know the seller's reputation and compare prices before buying. Renting textbooks online is another smart option, especially for titles that aren't available for rent in local stores. The popular chegg.com allows you to rent books for a semester, with free return shipping. This gets rid of the hassle of reselling books when the semester ends, but students who like to underline and takenotes in the margins should consider buying their books instead. Students can also soak in the Morningside Heights literary scene by browsing through the vendors along Broadway from 110 th to 114 th streets, which boast an eclectic array of mostly used books neatly set out on tables. It is possible to pick out a few Literature Humanities texts on the cheap, but these vendors have comparatively limited selections and usually don't offer textbooks. It is a delight for the casual reader and the serious collector alike, though, to find treasures buried among the vintage prints and foreign novels—and maybe even rekindle a love of reading for pleasure, which is so easily stifled by hefty syllabi.COMPARING REAL COSTS Why run from store to store and website to website?

506,Lit Hum and the examined life,10 September 2010,"BY CHRISTIA MERCERPlato tamously wrote in Apology : An unexamined life is not worth living"". If Plato is right, then Lit Hum encourages students and instructors alike to live a worthwhile life. Yeah, that's right, a worthwhile life. The official name of Lit Hum is Literature Humanities: Masterpieces of Western Literature and Philosophy. Unsurprisingly, Lit Hum readings pose significant philosophical questions. What shapes a worthwhile life? How do suffering and loss play a role? What temptations lead us astray? How does the agency of human beings differ? How and why are some people (e.g., women, servants, slaves) denied agency? How do family, friends, or divine being(s) limit life's options? What role do family, friends, or even art and story telling play in a worthwhile life? In the end, what is a worthwhile life good for? The texts of Lit Hum offer radically different responses to these questions. The answers of the ""Iliad"" are not like those of Augustine's ""Confessions"" or Montaigne's ""Essays,"" much less those of Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse."" There is an intellectual challenge at the heart of Lit Hum. Why should we care about the bratty guys disagreeing with one another at the outset of the ""Iliad,"" and why should we engage with a culture that treats women like these brats treat Briseis? The challenge is to push through such offensive features to discover the sophisticated fictionalized world beneath. Once we acknowledge the complexity of the poem's moral universe, we are able to recognize its subtlety and beauty. In the poem's sixth hook, we journey with Hector out of the war zone into the comforts of Troy, and then join him in conversation with his wife, Andromache. Not only has Andromache lost her parents and siblings to an earlier war, but she sees clearly what willhappen if Troy is defeated. In portraying her moral insight as she asks her husband to attend to the needs of his family and city rather than seek a warrior's glory, Homer offers a stark picture of what will happen if Troy falls. When Hector admits that he cannot ""shrink aside from fighting,"" we join Andromache in mourning the future devastation of this marvelous city and the certainty of her enslavement. As offensive as aspects of the story are to us, the losses, loyalties, and loves of this collapsing world are compellingly familiar. In the end, the poem does become a story about us. This tension between the unfamiliar and the familiar is the challenge of Lit Hum. The trick is to take seriously the remoteness of the values of our texts while recognizing ourselves within them. We have to walk a fine line. If we make our readings too much about us, we lose what they are; if we only examine them as archeological objects, their relevance for us today is diminished. But how exactly does all of this Lit Hum speak to Plato's point about the unexamined life? By asking us to explore a series of fictionalized moral universes, Lit Hum asks us to examine each carefully. We learn about different ways of being in the world, about different ways of living a human life. Not only do we compare these diverse universes, we eventually reflect on our own. The comparison between their values and ours elicits an analysis of our own lives. Before we know it, we are examining our moral universe and our place in it. If Plato is right and an unexamined life is not worth living, then Lit Hum does encourage us to live a worthwhile life. To help with our examination of Lit Hum texts, as well as our own self-examination in relation to them in the 21st century information age, we have created a Lit Hum website. The Fall Semester's materials will be launched this Sunday, Sept. 12. The site has three maingoals—to offer background materials related to the assigned readings, to include centuries of responses to Lit Hum works, and to build better connections between Lit Hum and other parts of the Core Curriculum. There are resources drawn from theater, music, opera, dance, visual arts, and much more. Many of these are taken from the materials of Art and Music Humanities. For example, Bernini's ""Rape of Persephone"" is a striking marble rendition of the first lines of ""Hymn to Demeter"" while Henry Purcell's ""Dido and Aeneas"" offers an important operatic treatment of the fourth book of ""The Aeneid"". One of the most exciting parts of the website is that it includes performances of plays (e.g., Peter Hall's production of Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon"" and Mark Cullingham's version of Euripides' ""Medea""), musical responses to our texts (e.g., Luigi Cherubini's opera, ""Medee"", and Simon Indelicate's ""The Book of Job: The Musical!""), and edgy pop-cultural renditions. Be sure you check out Hedwig (from John Cameron Mitchell's ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") singing Aristophanes' speech in the ""Symposium,"" Tom Lehrer's song about Oedipus Rex, and Led Zeppelin's ""Achilles' Last Stand."" Lit Hum can impact our lives in profound ways. Our website increases the chances for self-examination by asking us to confront the unfamiliar and familiar and compare our responses to generations of readers. If we let it, Lit Hum will change our lives. If we let it, our snazzy new Lit Hum website will encourage us all to think differently about our texts and to examine ourselves in relation to them life. Journey. Explore. Enjoy. Examine. The author is Gustave M.

507,"Let's talk about faith, baby",13 September 2010,"BY SARA BARBOURIt's a tricky thing, telling someone you care when they probably don't want to hear it. But that's just what friends of mine set out to do last week. As Columbia greeted its newest undergraduates, Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship was there to greet them too, handing out ice cream, helping people push bins, and beginning to address the sudden defensiveness that otherwise friendly first-years adopt when confronted with an admission of faith. I was one such first-year just three years ago. I may have been raised in a Christian family, but I was as likely as the next kid to quicken my step when approached by someone ""religious."" A person like that was obviously trying to get something—a conversation, a confession, a conversion. It never crossed my mind that they were looking to give. Religion was supposed to be private, something discussed under heavily moderated circumstances. In Literature Humanities, we could debate away over the Bible or Quran, even raise our voices defending or discussing different faiths. But outside of class, embarrassment descended—a reluctance to admit we belonged in any particular camp. It was almost that just by stating what we believed, we were already excluding people who would otherwise become new friends. Walking through the dorms last week to meet people, to help them settle in, and to ask them about their faith, I saw it happen first hand: the friendly smile and casual conversation going cold as soon as soon as we mentioned why we were there. ""We're from Inter Varsity, a Christian fellowship on campus,"" I'd say, suppressing the urge to add, ""I'm not trying to convert you—really."" Yes, we were there because we believe in God. But it strikes me as sad that an admission of faith turns an otherwise friendly situation into a tense one. When did we become so afraid of people who are open about what they believe? While New Student Orientation Program week certainly has its fair share of false starts and moments of misinformation, it's fair to say that as a new student on campus, the week sets the tone for the year ahead. Deciding to talk to first-yearsabout Christianity and faith may seem like a dangerous chance to be taking as a student group—it's certainly not easy to sidestep the stigma of holier-than-thou Bible pushers who knock on doors with conversion in mind. But if Inter Varsity decided that the chance to genuinely get to know fellow students and open the door to talking about what we believe wasn't worth that risk, then discussions of faith could very well remain relegated to the classroom, or abandoned altogether. NSOP has been flooded with events designed to get people talking about diversity, safety, tolerance, and sex. It's up to us, though, to be open about our faith, especially during what may be the only time in our lives when we'll be surrounded by such a vibrant and diverse group of people. Inter Varsity is a community I've come to appreciate, because despite our numerous, seemingly irreconcilable differences, we actually really enjoy spending time together as friends who are honestly seeking God in our lives. We run the full spectrum of denominations, and some come even though they don't really consider themselves Christian. It's the promise of a supportive and honest community that keeps us together.So what do I believe? When I look at the Bible, I see Christ going out of his way to befriend people from all walks of life, always without judgment. I see him eating (and often drinking) with those he has met, sitting down with them to genuinely talk about their lives. He passed by the self-righteous few who were religious without faith, choosing instead to hang out with the rejected, lonely, or confused. Which is not too far from how I felt as a first-year myself—and which is why I hope that at Columbia we'll grow more comfortable speaking with each other about our beliefs.

508,The game theory of college rankings,21 September 2010,"Columbia's impressive performance in this year's US News and World Report college rankings was met with a sense of relief in Morningside Heights—for many, Columbia's surge past Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, California Institute of Technology, and MIT was seen as long overdue. Most levelheaded readers, cognizant of the many inherent problems that arise when comparing colleges, take the rankings with a grain of salt. And, as Neil FitzPatrick argued in his column (""On aworld without rank"") yesterday, the rankings can sometimes serve an important purpose for prospective applicants. But, at the end of the day, far too much credence is afforded to the system, and Columbia should use its halcyon days near the top of the rankings to draw attention to those defects. Chief among these flaws is the ease with which the rankings can be manipulated. A case-in-point is Clemson University, which improved from #3B among public research universities in 2001 to #22 last year. Catherine Watt, a researcher at Clemson, has charged that the quest for a better ranking has led the school to inflate faculty salaries artificially and to auto-reject any student outside the top third of his or her class. But, perhaps the largest change made at Clemson was the choice to begin capping sections at 19, rather than 20 or 25. This decision was based on the mechanics of the US News methodology, wherein six percent of a school's final score is based on the percentage of the school's classes with fewer than 20 students. For schools with large core curriculums—schools like Columbia—it would be easy to follow Clemson's leadand begin capping sections at 19. Since 2009, Columbia has capped Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization classes, as well as a host of other core sections, at 22. Under this cap, the current capacity of Columbia's 60 CC sections is 1,320 students. To distribute these students in sections of 19 rather than 22 would require nine additional sections. But, considering that about 30 percent of all of Columbia classes are in the Core, those nine new sections may be well worth their cost. About 79 percent of Columbia's classes already contain fewer than 20 students, a figure bested only by Harvard and Yale. Dropping the cap to 19 would easily vault us ahead of both schools—a change that would add a fraction of a point to our overall 1-100 rating and aid our chances of maintaining our ranking next year. As it stands now, Columbia and its peer institutions are navigating a bizarre version of the prisoner's dilemma. Some colleges appear to be shamelessly manipulating the rankings, while others have resisted even minor policy changes despite the enormous benefits they would bring. In an ideal world, all colleges would come together and agree not to alter any policies for the sake of rankings. But that, of course, is not the world in which we live. And when profits and prestige trump morality and fair play, the game theory model would suggest that it is in Columbia's best interest to pursue certain marginal changes. It's nice to be ranked #4.1 think we should be ranked first, but not at the expense of intellectual honesty and institutional integrity. As we look forward towards next year's rankings, it is perhaps well to ask whether Columbia ought to participate in such a fallacious system at all. In ""On Liberty,"" John Stuart Mill argues that thebest time to speak out against an unfair system is when that system has afforded you an advantage—only at this juncture, he says, will bystanders feel confident that one's arguments are based on the merits and not on self-interest. As it stands today, US News has afforded Columbia just such an advantage. And so, before next year's rankings are published, Columbia should take a stand against the US News rankings. Lee Bollinger should write to the publishers of US News to voice concern about the system. At the veryleast, he should join more than 60 other college presidents in signing the Education Conservancy's letter to US News, calling for a radically altered system. Several other schools, notably including Reed College, have walked away from the rankings altogether. Alas, as long as Columbia's peer institutions continue to participate in the rankings charade, we can ill afford to take such a stand. But that does not mean we cannot be leaders—leaders in pushing for a new and fairer system, a system in which it doesn't pay to cheat.

509,Literature Humanities website gets makeover,24 September 2010,"BY AMBER TUNNELL AND SCARLETT TOHME Columbia Daily SpectatorLiterature Humanities has now arrived in the 21st century. The website for Lit Humone of Columbia's trademark Core courses—has previously only given basic information about the class. Now, after a full-blown makeover, the website features images, paintings, video clips, and audio files that complement the works read in class. The change is meant to make the course more engaging for students, said ChristiaMercer, the chair of Lit Hum and a professor of philosophy, who oversaw the overhaul. For example, for Plato's ""Symposium,"" the site has a clip from of the song ""the Origin of Love"" from the film ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" where a singer sings a song based on Aristophanes' speech about love. ""I want to combine intellectual seriousness with edginess,"" Mercer said. ""We want to make Lit Hum intellectually cool."" Elizabeth Bonnette, a Ph.D. candidate who is teaching Lit Hum this year, said she plans to utilize the website in herclass through weekly responses which incorporate a piece of art from the site. Bonnette said her class recently started ""Gilgamesh"" and that she liked how students could actually watch videos of people carving on tablets—the manner in which the work was originally written. ""It's going to be nice for them to explore things we don't get to in class,"" Bonnette said. The Lit Hum website is also meant to encourage connections with other required Core classes, such as Art and MusicHumanities, by including pieces of art and music relevant to the Lit Hum syllabus. ""I think people who teach Art Hum don't know as much about Lit Hum as they should,"" Mercer, who has taught both, said, explaining that the site will help bridge that gap. The site also has a comprehensive timeline for the material covered in the Core classes, which will help them understand what was going on in the other disciplines at the time the Lit Hum works were written. Susan Boynton, the chair of Music Hum and a music professor, said that Music Hum plans to also use the new site to establish connections between literature and music. ""In the interest of creating more intersections betweenthe Core courses, we hope in the future to link from the Lit Hum page to related materials for Music Hum,"" Boynton said in an email. There are also additions that only faculty can see, such as example questions, exams, and grading criteria. The extra resources are meant to make it easier for the faculty, who come from a range of fields—from Italian to religion to Slavic languages—to teach the works to students. Mercer also hopes this will convince more senior faculty to get involved with the course by making it easier to teach. ""I think this new website will help those of us who live outside the literature world get into the classics mind-set,"" Anna Couturier, CC 'lO, who helped Mercer organize the material for the site over the summer, said in an email fromBerlin, where she is studying. ""It will also give the Columbia community an opportunity to discuss ... the strengths and weaknesses of the core,"" she said. While resources for only the first semester's materialhave been added, Mercer said they are now going to work on the second semester of the course. Then, next year, the University plans to work onthe website for Contemporary Civilization, the yearlong philosophy course all Columbia College sophomores are required to take. Not all students were enthused. Adie Wadles, CC'l4, has never heard of it. ""I didn't hear of the new website, and I wouldn't go on it. And I probably wouldn't really care about it,"" Wadles said. Olivia Harris, CC 'l4, was more excited about the change. ""I would use the site because we read really deep and sophisticated works like ""The Iliad,"" and it would be really useful and helpful to use images, music, movie clips, and other supplements to aid in understanding the texts,"" Harris said.

510,Thucydides was not a romantic,28 September 2010,"Every Columbia College student reads Thucydides' ""History of the Peloponnesian War."" But does everyone agree with the philosophy it represents? ""History of the Peloponnesian War"" is a laborious work. It lacks the flippant style, whimsical anecdotes, and evocative character developments of Herodotus' ""Histories."" Yet, as we learn in Literature Humanities, that is part of what makes Thucydides a genius and gives him a rightful place in our Core. His work is a seminal text of historiography, one that forgoes unnecessary jocularity and colorful narratives in favor of a more objective and straightforward historical account. But, alas, ours is a Herodotean world. Our contemporary global discourse is one of rash sensationalism and gaudy attention-grabbing. Moderate, levelheaded writing is insipid, stilted, demoded. Without provocation, one can hardly find a Way. A modern-day Thucydides would hardly make a living. Perhaps those of us sheltered between Broadway and Amsterdam can take advantage of our insularity and construct a community of splendid isolation, a Thucydidean haven. We have a whole lifetime to take on civilization and all its discontents. For now, then, perhaps we can put our worldly pretenses on temporary hold, as we build for ourselves a happy oasis, one free from the dizzying polarization of discourse that surrounds us. Let us, then, follow true Columbian tradition. Let us be radicals. And let us do this by having a conversation that isn't radicalized. What would it mean to have a respectful, rational, constructive dialogue on this campus? Such a discourse would call for the subservience of one's individual interests for the greater good. It would mean an unabashedly open forum, in which each community member could participate with perfect candor and forthrightness—but not for his or her own personal benefit. Rather, the impetus to contribute to a discussion would arise from the conviction that differing opinions ""share the truth,"" as John Stuart Mill would say, and that the collision of contrasting opinions catalyzes the creation of a better, greater opinion. An open conversation would thus call for each member of the community to surrender any personal attachment to his or her own ideas for the sake of general progress. And such a conversation could only take place in a space free from extreme polarization, in a forum free from fear of the domination of one opinion because of the forcefulness with which it is presented. Too often do we sensationalize—and I say this because I, with my obvious predilection for bombast and fustian, am perhaps the guiltiest party.Tragically, we find in academia, in the substance of our study at Columbia, a crying absence of such a paradigm of positive, constructive discourse. We are trained—or perhaps we train ourselves, in our mimicry of those whom we revere as historical paragons of intellectualism—to sensationalize, to seek to impose on others the most alluring arguments through the force of our persuasion. This, to a large extent, is understandable. We live in a culture that values individualism, personal identity, and self-promotion. In a world full of intelligent people, and in a college community where everyone is smart, we find the urge to differentiate ourselves, to stand out like we did in high school. Often, this is impossible to do without a little bit of hyperbole, without expressing our opinions forcefully or developing opinions that are deliberately provocative. But we must resist this urge, this natural tendency to favor splashiness. To have a truly fruitful dialogue, perhaps we must temper the expression of our thoughts to put them in more agreeable, less radical terms. This does not suggest equivocating or prevaricating—it is possible to be candid and forthright without being temerarious. In fact, an earnest, sincere conversation can only take place in an environment free from vitriol and outlandishness, and we must create that environment on our campus, even if it is wanting in the rest of the world.Thucydides writes, ""And it may well be that my history will seem less easy to read because of the absence in it of a romantic element... My work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever."" Our arguments at Columbia certainly have a ""romantic element."" Do they occur, then, merely to meet the taste of an immediate public, or are they conversations directed toward a better community, with an influence that will last forever?We are trained to sensationalize, to seek to impose on others the most alluring arguments through the force of our persuasion.Amin Ghadimi is a Columbia College junior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.

511,"Interpreting ""interfaith""",26 October 2010,"Columbia is home to a vibrant culture of interfaith collaboration and exchange. But what does this mean? And why does it matter? We all profess the merits of interfaith initiatives. Of course, a progressive, modern community like ours hosts an amiahle interchange of religious ideas. Interfaith dialogue is the natural expression of our love of diversity. After all, we are Columbia. But if we move beyond such genteel facades and urbane pleasantries, we may find a different reality hiding behind a specious mask. To what extent do we view interfaith dialogue as just an inconvenient devoir, theunhappy task of a faithful few fulfilling an obligation to political correctness? Or as just the newest and trendiest concoction of the dealers of epiphenomena, an opportunity for religion addicts to go hang out with the rest of the opiated masses while the sober go on with their real lives? It is true that interfaith dialogue, when conducted insubstantially, can in fact devolve into these things. If we seek to engage with one another only to propitiate, thinking that devotion to the punctilios of dialogue in itself is enough, then the interfaith movement will forever remain an empty and quite unnecessary formality. And it will deserve any furtive glances of scorn it may attract. But if we think deeply and earnestly about the purpose of interfaith exchange, then we find that interfaith projects are not just the expression of airy-fairy ideals of global harmony and cross-religious friendship. Rather, interfaith initiatives are indispensable to both a prosperous society and a thriving individual life. The platitudes about interfaith dialogue are true. In a world where few things are as dangerous as ignorance, interfaith work provides real, living knowledge. Certainly, independently studying the sacred texts of other religions is an essential way to combat religious ignorance, but it can never replace actual interaction with adherents of different faiths. Interfaith activity can thus lead to an understanding of the fundamental human virtues—regardless of their multifarious expressions and myriad targets—that we all share. Less appreciated than such truisms, however, are the benefits of interfaith dialogue to the individual. Interfaith initiatives act as the ""contact zones"" in which different and sometimes contradictory belief systems interact with one another. It is in these zones, where we look at other systems of thought with curiosity and skepticism, that we are also forced to examine our own beliefs and test theirvalidity. When our faiths come in contact with others', do they still feel right? Do our intellects, our emotions, our inmost thoughts still accept them? Do we believe what we always thought we believed? These are difficult questions to ask, but we have to ask them, especially in college. This is not to say that we must abandon our beliefs when we seek to enter into an interfaith discussion. To do so would be disingenuous and in fact would be detrimental both to our own selves and to the interfaith initiative as a whole. Interfaith cannot operate in a phony world in which everyone is equally right and all opinions are equally valid. The ability to defend what one believes and to engage others critically is essential to faith, and it is a practice that does not necessarily preclude a genuine interna] desire to check and refine one's beliefs. Moreover, ""interfaith,"" despite its name, cannot exclude people who choose not to affiliate with organized religion. All, atheists and agnostics included, must be part of the conversation if it is to be fruitful.This is, to a large extent, what already happens at Columbia, not only when faith groups on campus collaborate and converse with one another, but also when we gather in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization to consider life's fundamental questions. We do not readily think of these classes as interfaith discussions, but perhaps we should. What other opportunities in life will we have to engage with a diverse group of brilliant minds on what life means? Alas, too few. This, I think, is what ""interfaith"" means. ""Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship,"" say the writings of my own faith. After all, life itself is an interfaith activity, and we cannot blithely live on pretending that it isn't. Amin Ghadimi is a Columbia College junior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.

512,"True globalization, true diversity",29 October 2010,"BY WILLIAM THEODORE DE BARYEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome.There has been much ado about globalization recently at Columbia, much of it focused on the Global Centers—with new ones likely to open in Paris and Mumbai this spring. Fortunately it has been accompanied by attention also to strengthening the home base to provide for the educational resources needed to support these outreach activitiessome of it in major developments like the Manhattanville campus to provide for growing academic needs; others in seemingly modest ways like providing a center for graduate students where they can meet together to discuss their common needs, as recommended by the Student Affairs Committee of the University Senate. This latter need not be a big project, but it is symbolically important that graduate students should have even a small facility where, to balance the inherent specialization of graduate schools, their common interests and shared concerns can be given a voice on the main campus, so that diversity is grounded in and sustained by shared human values.This is not the first time Columbia has faced the challenge of globalization. When we were thrust unexpectedly and for the first time into World War I, Columbia College responded with a new program called War and Peace Issues that eventually became incorporated into the Contemporary Civilization course, required of all undergraduates as the first component of the new Core Curriculum. This was soon followed in the '3os by Literature, Art, and Music Humanities. External engagement evoked an internal response to meet the challenge. The next phase was World War 11, which led to the development of courses dealing with the Asian Classics and Civilization comparable to those in Literature Humanities and CC, which became part of the core requirements with limited options in the 'sos and '6os. The more recent to-do about globalization so far has been a response primarily to opportunities offered for study centers abroad that focus on mini-campuses in major cities already heavily engaged in the world market economy. It seems a natural response to economic globalization, but the extent to which the new centers have robust links to the University's academic base is unclear. Dual-degree programs have been vetted by the University Senate's Executive Committee and approved by the Senate as a whole. They were treated as routine graduate programs that did not need to be discussed as part of a balanced university education. Study abroad, however, does not satisfy the need for a globalcore, and is no substitute for it. It is fine for summer adventuring but cannot fulfill the purposes of a core curriculum. Meanwhile, the global component of the Core Curriculum has not enjoyed a similar strengthening or enhancement. On the contrary, the present Global Core requirement has undergone such diversification as to erode any concept of core at all. Instead of focusing on shared human concerns across cultures, the distribution has featured diversity in the form of departmentalization or the substitution of different disciplinary approaches to learning. This diversification can of course accommodate itself easily to the variety of opportunities presented abroad, but it is not balanced by attention to the shared human values that should guide the process of globalization. This atrophy of the Core concept is accompanied today by an exclusive emphasis on diversity, as if the latter could stand on its own without consensual agreement on the shared human values that should underlie and nourish respect for diversity. Recently, major appointments to the central administration have been hailed as advancing diversity as a self-sufficient value, and questions as to the educational philosophy that should inform and support diversity go unanswered. As a result, Columbia has tended to lose the distinct educational character that formerly was identified with the College's Core Curriculum and which has so far been the strongest factor in student, faculty andespecially alumni support of the College. Now as we embark on new ""global"" enterprises, the University's increasing costs are being sustained by expanding college enrollment In the past when this had been attempted, the move to increase college tuition income was ostensibly accompanied by supposed enhancements to the College program, but anyone familiar with that program knows that these claimed ""enhancements"" have proven illusory. Any new moves to increase college enrollment should reckon with the danger they could represent to the dilution of the Core and its distinctive small-class, discussionmethod of instruction (in contrast to the large lecture classes exhibiting ""famous"" faculty ""performers"" common to other universities). The weakness of the Global Core and the decay of our commitment to the fundamental concepts of the Core are at the heart of the true question of how to deal with ""globalization."" It is what should be in the forefront of discussion by all segments of the Universitystudent, faculty, alumni—as well as bodies like the University Senate and the central administration.

513,Science is not a clique,8 November 2010,"BY YANG HUAbout 50 years ago, the English physicist and novelist C.P. Snow delivered a lecture at the University of Cambridge titled ""The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution."" This was his famous lament that ""the intellectual life of the whole of Western society is increasingly being split into two polar groups,"" with scientists on one side and the literary scholars on the other—a Core Curriculum nightmare. C.P. Snow blames the literary scholars for perpetuating this ""gulf of mutual incomprehension"" by their sustenance of shameless ignorance of fundamental ideas like the Second Law of Thermodynamics when, according to Snow, this would be the scientific equivalent of blowing off Shakespeare. But when science is the basis of pieces like biologist Francis Crick's ""The Astonishing Hypothesis,"" which claims that ""your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules,"" it's no wonder that science could seem unappealing, even standoffish, to anyone but the most die-hard natural scientists. Through provocative contributions like ""The Astonishing Hypothesis,"" which some opine vastly understates the substance of the human soul, science raises doubts in its adequacy as the single authority on truth. However, from scrutinizing works like ""The Astonishing Hypothesis,"" we pounced on scientific thought in general before examining any single discipline's capacity to explain our humanity.We did not hear, for instance, that much scientific progress comes from interdisciplinary accomplishments rather than from the achievements of disciplines in isolation. A recent article in The Economist describes how insights from the study of natural vision have helped advance the state of art in computer vision. The computer vision challengehas been to devise ways to construct scene awareness from a mere collection of pixels, and Yann LeCun, now at New York University, pioneered an approach that imitates certain aspects of our own visual cortex. I also know a linguistics student, who to Snow would probably be more like a literary scholar, who contributes to natural language processing at our Center for Computational Learning Systems. The deep and narrow approach to problem solving has lost some potency. Therefore, the monochrome attempt by ""The Astonishing Hypothesis"" to explain human identity demonstrates its own anachronism as much as it hints at science's limitations. Regardless of what science can or cannot answer at the moment, the dedication of people who live to seek better answers should at least deserve the benefit of the doubt. Science has shown us where difficulties lie, and so far it's been science that has addressed them. Science's current shortcomings don't bind its potential. Reaching out to Snow's literary scholars and not restricting our associations with science to the world of computers, test tubes, and particle accelerators would be a step toward realizing science's full potential. Especially at Columbia, no student should feel caught in a crossfire between Frontiers of Science haters and Literature Humanities rebels or even fire the shots to start. Harboring frustration is understandable, but having it devolve into this recent divide, postured as debate but identified by how science is pitted against nebulous alternatives, incarnates Snow's unfortunate vision where, in the face of difficulty, one concedes to science's constraints before inviting more participation. If Snow couldn't guess that our new divide was sparked by a scientist, what would that say about the severity of the nightmare in the school of the Core Curriculum? No one should wait for a breakthrough in any scientific field to better understand our humanity—such a profound achievement takes scientific effort from all human disciplines, literature not excepted. It might be in the mold of the literary scholar to continue the journey to truth from Crick's hypothesis by posing, say, this simple but scientifically spirited rejoinder: Though many animals are similarly endowed with vast neural networks, why do no other animals on this earth write?

514,STAFF EDITORIAL Dean Michele Moody-Adams,8 November 2010,"Dean Michele Moody-AdamsColumbia College Dean Michele Moody-Adams, School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Feniosky Peha-Mora, and Provost Claude Steele have all been at Columbia for at least a full year. This week, the Editorial Board, after speaking to administrators, professors, alumni, and students, will offer our evaluation of their first years and what we hope to see from them in the years to come. Before she arrived at Columbia, Dean Michele MoodyAdams served as vice provost for undergraduate education at Cornell. In her job in Ithaca, N.Y., she was responsible for the academic lives of 13,000 students in seven undergraduate schools. Cornell's undergraduate population dwarfs Columbia's, and its undergraduate mission is distinctly different from Columbia's focus on the liberal arts. Dean Moody-Adams came to Columbia—a large and tremendously complicated, bureaucratic organization—from a different world. Her first duty, obviously, was to familiarize herself with our structure and our culture, and she has done so admirably. She has been more accessible to students than her predecessor was. She holds frequent teas and movie nights and has maintained open channels of communication with the student government, and by all accounts, she has worked well with her colleagues in the administration. We are impressed with the reputation Dean MoodyAdams has built for herself in only a year, and we are hopefid about the goals she has set out. In an email, Dean Moody-Adams identified three priorities for her tenure. She hopes to ""enhance undergraduate science programs,"" to ""strengthen... the global dimensions of the curriculum,"" and to ""ensure the health and integrity of the Core Curriculum."" The first goal will take time, energy, and money to achieve, but it seems realistic. The second is rather vague. It echoes the administration's constant advocacy for all things global, but it lacks a concrete set of initiatives. It is the third goal that we believe to be most important for the future of Columbia College. We also see this third goal as the most challenging, particularly in light of the exact nature of Dean Moody-Adams' role at the University. She is not only dean of Columbia College, but also vice president for undergraduate education, which makes her responsible for undergraduate education and programs across the University. That the dean of Columbia College is in charge of undergraduate education at Columbia has a certain logic. Columbia College is the largest and oldest division of the University, and it is also very much this school's face to the world. In many ways, it sets the tone for undergraduate life at Columbia. It is critical to have a sense of unity in the undergraduate experience at Columbia. Under Dean Moody-Adams, Columbia has finally gone forward with a unified Committee on Instruction. Long a faculty priority, the unified COI is an inter-school body designed to coordinate the curriculum and rationalize policies between schools. The COI has already overseen a move to standardize the disciplinary process for undergraduates. The unified COI was not Moody-Adams' idea, but it was realized under her leadership. We are encouraged by this development, and we believe it serves as an example of the advantages of Dean MoodyAdams' dual roles. Because Dean Moody-Adams is at the center of undergraduate education at Columbia, she is in a unique position to improve it. She has the opportunity to carve out a space for the college within a more efficient, collaborative, and internally complementary undergraduate program. But there is also a real danger intrinsic to Dean MoodyAdams' dual roles. It is no mean feat to juggle two jobs at once. And while one might assume that what is good for Columbia College is good for the University and vice versa, that is not always the case. Dean Moody-Adams has the difficult task of ensuring that her two roles complement each other. While we trust that Dean Moody-Adams speaks in good faith when she says she is fully committed to protecting and preservingthe identity of Columbia College, we have not seen any concrete evidence of how she plans to achieve this goal.What is the identity of Columbia College? It is, above all else, an institution focused on the liberal arts. Its robust Core Curriculum represents its commitment to a truly liberal education. We cannot imagine a Columbia College without the Core. But the Core is not invincible, and we should not take for granted that, because it has endured as long it has, it always will. It is incumbent upon Dean Moody-Adams to demonstrate that the Core will be strengthened. The Core is exceptionally expensive to maintain, and, with 120 sections of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization alone, it is more than just a logistical headache. It seems improbable that the Core would disappear, but it could change or be diluted. Larger class sizes, fewer professors teaching Core classes—we fear these changes because we have already seen them. If we continue in that direction, in 20 years, the Core we know today could be a shell of its former self. The same can be said of Columbia College as a stronghold for liberal arts education. Historically, there have been no pre-professional majors at Columbia College. But this year alone, we have seen the introduction of a special concentration in business management and a major in financial economics, as well as the announcement of a potential major in public health. These developments alone do not represent a sea change in Columbia's mission, but we need to know that what is true today will remain true. If Columbia College moves away from its commitment to the liberal arts, the intellectual and academic experience it offers will necessarily be compromised.That is not to say we should fear change. We need not hold on to what is old simply because it is old. CC, now considered an untouchable and essential part of the Core, took years to gain acceptance at Columbia, as Dean Moody-Adams wisely noted. She has spoken of efforts to further develop Frontiers of Science and the Global Core—efforts we would welcome. Dean Moody-Adams may be a vice president, but her primary role at Columbia is dean of Columbia College. As such, it is her responsibility to serve as the guarantor of Columbia College's mission. We would be naive if we said that hers was an easy job. She faces tremendous pressure from every direction—from alumni, from faculty, from students, and from her fellow administrators and superiors. She is expected to bring in huge amounts of money through fundraising, a daunting task for a new face in Morningside. She must work within the context of a larger university, where turf and resources are always up for grabs. And, of course, Dean Moody-Adams arrived here in the midst of the greatest financial turmoil the nation has seen since Nicholas Murray Butler's presidency at Columbia. The University has fared better than its peers through the financial crisis, but these are still difficult times. Yet, these are also times of unprecedented opportunity. Thirty years ago, Columbia College had not yet admitted a woman as a student. Twenty years ago, our global presence was limited mostly to international students and professors, as well as long-distance phone calls. Ten years ago, some people saw Columbia's lack of space into which to expand as an existential threat to the University. Today, the dean of Columbia College is a woman. We have almost instantaneous access to information—or to people-anywhere on earth, and we are expanding both within Manhattan and around the globe. We do not doubt the University's ability to adapt to a changing world. It is Dean Moody-Adams' job to ensure that as we adapt, we also preserve. Until she makes concrete her promises to further the mission of Columbia College, we will maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. But we will also remain optimistic. Columbia College may be 256 years old, but it still has room to grow.Grading the AdministratorsIt is incumbent upon Dean MoodyAdams to demonstrate that the Core will be strengthened."
515,Lit Hum expands online programs,9 November 2010,"BY RAKHI AGRAWAL Columbia Daily SpectatorThe recently revamped Literature Humanities website is about to showcase a lot more undergraduate work. Lit Hum plans to launch a ""Core Scholars"" program, according to Christia Mercer, chair of Lit Hum and philosophy professor. As part of this program, students will be able to submit Core-themed essays, which expand on central themes within the Core, such as beauty, family, or suffering; ""Core connection"" essays, which explore how two parts of the Core connect; or ""contemporary reflections"" essays, which compare a part of the Core to contemporary events. ""One of the goals is just to get the students thinking about core issues outside of the courses they are taking,"" Mercer said. ""Another goal is to get students to think about the connections among the parts of the core."" ""For example, you may write a core connection essay about war in Goya's paintings that you are studying in Art Humanities, and let's say, the 'The Iliad,' which you study in Literature Humanities, and that's pretty awesome,"" she added. The new addition is part of the overhaul of the website, which will now include resources such as sample midterm exams, additional readings, and background information on the texts for both instructors and students. Joey Shemuel, CC 'll and former Spectator deputy photo editor, thinks Core Scholars will ultimately benefit students. ""It's another way [for students] to be involved with the administration in a more academic capacity,"" Shemuel said, adding that there is also ""a lot of potential for cross-Core scholarship or interaction."" The project also hopes to secure funding to publish the essays in print, Mercer said. Shemuel added that the articles would most likely be published in a journal format similar to the Blue and White. ""For students that may want to work on a journal, it's good preparation,"" he said. The primary incentives for students to submit, Mercer said,would be to obtain peer recognition and a line item on their resumes. Still, some students said they don't feel these are good enough incentives to contribute essays. ""Because there aren't any concrete incentives for students to contribute to it, I don't think the quality of their contributions will be very strong,"" Rui Yu, CC 'l4, said. Noelle Van Rysselberghe, CC 'l3, feels that time would be an issue for many. ""I would definitely, like, check it out and read what's up there, but I don't feel like I would have time to write an essay that's not for a class,"" Rysselberghe said. Despite the support from professors the site has gotten so far, publicity for the site and the program continues to he a struggle, Mercer noted. In upcoming weeks, students.can expect to receive emails soliciting essays, see flyers posted around campus asking, ""Do you want to be a Core Scholar?"" and more mentions of the program inCore classes, she said. Current essays on the website are those written by professors, but she hopes that they will eventually only be the work of students. Still, Mercer fears that students may take advantage of the expanded site and plagiarize from the new material. ""Given that they [the essays] are all online and all of the instructors can see them there, it would be pretty stupid to borrow heavily from them,""she said, adding that plans are in place to set up a way for checking for plagiarism that would originate from the site. Since Oct. 16, the average daily hits to the site is 165, 16 percent of which are logged-in students, and 12 percent come from logged-in instructors, Mercer said. She hopes that the launching of the Core Scholars project will cause these numbers to rise. ""Our thinking is that if you give students good examples of good papers they can be inspired,"" she said. news@columbiaspectator.com"
516,Columbia forgets her religious foundation,12 November 2010,"BY STEPHEN WU""In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen"" will remain forever impressed in the minds of countless Columbians. This is, of course, the motto of this great institution, and was once its guiding pedagogical belief. It serves today as a reminder of the ancient pedigree of Columbia, which the modern university has struggled to retain while embracing a progressive, secular agenda that is necessarily in opposition to our foundational principles. Toward that end, Columbia has institutionally abandoned the religion—and consequently the idea of universal truth—upon which she was founded, leaving her deracinated and groping for new meaning. Columbia has not divested herself wholly of religion, but surely she has lost the moral clarity of her founders. The Core Curriculum still mandates familiarity with the Torah, the Gospels, and the works of Aquinas and Augustine. Here, the school must be commended, for at other institutions, undergraduates can avoid opening books that have been the groundwork for billions of spiritual lives. The problem lies, however, in Columbia's reluctance to present some dominant version of truth consonant with her founding principles. The Literature Humanities course, for example, articulates that students should ""not expect"" to be taught ""what these texts are about."" How silly, the Core office intones, for students to want to learn about the central themes and issues presented, and moreover to have some sort of evaluative framework by which to judge and favor one value system over the other. Here, the University falls into the alluring trap of relativism, for fixed ideas of the good and the right are incompatible with the fuzzy, pluralistic, and all-inclusive ethos of the day. This paradox is intellectually untenable. The Quran and the Bible should be studied comparatively, but both cannot be right. Both are necessary for perspective, and diversity of thought is required in order to see the flaws—and the genius—of our own tradition, but one value set must eventually be preferred to the other. In the Columbia tradition, there are not-so-subtle hints as to which side our founders and our history would come down on. The essence of morality is to have an exclusive claim to understanding: one that respects other viewpoints, but at the end of the day, one that will vigorously defend and promote itself as the last, best way forward. The campus is steeped in religious tradition, which makes our present secularization deeply ironic—comic, even, if it weren't so seriously alarming. The president of Columbia University, at no less occasion than Commencement, speaks glowingly of Columbia's ""tradition"" and ""heritage,"" but ignores the original understanding of the school's charge to impart values based on Anglicanism. It ought to be noted that Mr. Bollinger, who makes not one reference to or acknowledgment of the transcendent, speaks in the magnificent shadow of Low Library, where, etched in stone, we declare our mission to be dedicated to ""the Advancement of the Public Good and the Glory of Almighty God.""I confess that I myself have no particular pious religiosity. But I am appreciative of history and tradition, and religion is the cornerstone of our inheritance. Columbia must make a choice in order to be intellectually honest: whether to embrace the faith of her fathers, or to cast it aside. If indeed the school needs theology and God in order to attain truth, as our motto proclaims, then the University has a mission, and indeed a duty, to promote certain values. We are, of course, uncomfortable with speaking in these didactic absolutes in this age of accommodation, for fear of provoking offense. In the end, we have this decision to make about the direction of our future. With tempered hope, Columbia has all the pieces in place to resurrect her oldest values. Indeed, we may be like the prodigal son: ""Mortui, at reviximus; perieramus, at inventus samus."" We may be dead, and now live; we may be lost, but now are found. The author is a sophomore in Columbia College. He is an editor for the Helvidius Group.The campus is steeped in religious tradition, which makes our present secularization deeply ironic."
517,Columbia's continued enlightenment,15 November 2010,"In an article published last Thursday (""Columbia forgets her religious foundation,"" Nov. 12), Stephen Wu decried the fact that ""Columbia has institutionally abandoned the religion—and consequently the idea of universal truth—on which she was founded."" His point was interesting, eloquently expressed, and, ulti-mately, very, very wrong. For Columbia to instill in its students the Anglican morals of its founders would be to betray both the principle of intellectual freedom that is the basis of the modern University and the concept of a liberal arts education embodied by the Core Curriculum. As Wu pointed out, Columbia was indeed founded as an Anglican institution in 1754 with the motto ""In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen""(""ln Thy light shall we see light""). But Wu seemed to ignore the following 256 years of both intellectual history and the history of Columbia in drawing his next conclusion: ""If indeed the school needs theology and God in order to attain truth, as our motto proclaims, then the University has a mission, and indeed a duty, to promote certain values."" Setting aside the fact that a motto ispoor grounds on which to base the assumption that an institution ""needs"" religion to attain truth, it is worth noting that the second charter of Columbia—granted by the state legislature of New York after the Revolutionary War—prohibited the use of any religious tests in hiring faculty. It is therefore evident that, at the time when King's College became Columbia, the institution was already moving away from its Anglican roots. Granted, this move came at the behest of the legislature—a body outside the University—but one can see why a law-giving body in a new nation intent on religious freedom might want to divorce religious prejudice from an institution receiving state funding. It was this great intellectual principle of the era—a principle that we study in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization—that motivated the first step toward secularism. Of course, it would be wrong to assume that Columbia embraced the notion of religious freedom simply because of a slight change to its charter. In 1854, the University was investigated by the New York State Senate for violating that charter by refusing to hire Oliver Wolcott Gibbs, a graduate of Columbia, because of his Unitarian faith. Soon after, the Christian Examiner in Boston described the.college as ""good in classics, weak in sciences; very few distinguished graduates."" Gibbs would have been a professor of chemistry, but rather than improve a weak department, the close-minded board of trustees turned adistinguished candidate down because he was not Anglican. Obviously, Wu was not suggesting that the modern University, were it to re-em-brace its Anglican roots, should engage in similarly prejudiced hiring practices, but it is not hard to imagine that a university deciding to ""present some dominant version of truth consonant with her founding principles"" might deter countless bright teachers and students who possessed alternate principles.It is here that Wu's argument is weakest. Leaving aside ethnic diversity for a moment, his proposal leaves no room for intellectual diversity, which is the true heart of the modern University. He condemns the Core office for saying that ""students should not expect Lit Hum to teach them what these texts are about."" But in saying that Columbia does not want students ""to learn about the central themes and issues presented"" or ""to have some sort of evaluative framework by which to judge and favor one value system over the other,"" he is missing the point. Lit Hum instructors—at least, all the ones Ihave heard of or been taught by—do their best to teach what each text says and nothing more. They help students see the textual basis for religions like Anglicanism, but they do not preach the tenets of Anglicanism, which are nothing more than interpretations of the text in front of them made by other men. As for an evaluative framework, this is precisely what Lit Hum and CC look to provide. In exposing students to the history of Western thought, these courses give us a context within which to judge any ideas that we might encounter—the same context in which those ideas were formed. In ""What Is Enlightenment?""—a text read in many CC classes—lmmanuel Kant opens with the following: ""Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another."" He proclaims the motto of enlightenment to be, ""Have the courage to use your own understanding!"" Columbia has granted and continues to grant thousands of students this courage. To go against that now, to encourage students to accept ""guidance from another,"" would be the worst kind of regression and would be shameful.

518,Bad Poetry Contest inspires the best of students' worst,18 November 2010,"BY OLIVIA WONG Columbia Daily SpectatorThe 25th Annual Alfred Joyce Kilmer Memorial Bad Poetry Contest is calling out to all Columbians to put the midterm stress behind them and em-brace the silliness of horribly clever poetry—no experience required. The Bad Poetry Contest, hosted by Columbia's Philolexian Society, will be held on Thursday at 8 p.m. in Barnard's Held Auditorium. The bad poetry contest is easily Philo's most popular event, even though most of the society's other events—Professor Tea several times a semester and Beat Night, held in honor of Philo alum Allen Ginsberg—are open to the public. Why is that so? According to last year's winner, Philo alum Edward Rueda, CC 'O5, ""I think Columbia is severely lacking in school pride, but a strong sense of sarcasm is one of the few things that brings all the students together."" Rueda, like many Philo alums, is returning for the event and will open the contest with his winning poem, ""Balloon Boy by Philip Glass."" ""I'm very excited for that,"" he said. ""My girlfriend, my mother, and many close friends of mine will be in the audience to see me do my winning piece."" Christopher Travis, CC 'll and the moderator of Philo, attributes the buzz of the event to its ability to encourage participation from the whole student body. ""It's really fun because it's something everybody can do,"" Travis said. ""Everybody can write a bad poem."" As moderator, Travis runs all of Philo's weekly meetings, which usually consist of literary debates. He will be emceeingthe contest. Travis had hoped to win the contest last year with a poem about Literature Humanities but still plans to return with another bid for the title this year. Most Philo members do choose to participate, but they leave plenty of space for attendees who simply sign up at the event. Philo encourages anybody to enter as long as the material is not too offensive or so good that it cannot be classified as bad poetry.In fact, Philo has been known to target new members for recruitment after strong contest entries. Rueda was recruited by Philo his sophomore year after performing at the contest and has competed every year since. ""My favorite part of the contest is when somebody I don't know ... gets up and just wows me with how terribly funny his poem is,"" Travis said. ""Poems that win are poems that demonstrate that you know what makes a good poem ... without letting the slightest traits of good meaningful poetry to invade your lines,"" Daniel Walden, CC 'll, said when asked what a poem needed to win. As the Impresario of Philo, Walden coordinates all of Philo's events, the biggest being the contest. As a model for bad poetry, Philo follows in the footsteps of Alfred Joyce Kilmer, a Philo alum and former vice president of the society. Kilmer's poem ""Trees"" is, according to Walden, ""a stinker of a poem."" Kilmer wrote a lot of deliberately-bad poetry that Walden described as""very tongue-in-cheek. ... A real kick in the face to the modernist poets."" It is his legacy of bad poetry that is honored each year by Philo. Philo is more than happy to carry on the tradition of bad poetry, encouraging poetic disasters in the name of humor. In fact, both Travis and Walden were quick to attribute the contest's popularity to its humor. ""It's a very peculiar kind of mix of highbrow intellect and lowbrow humor that I think many Columbia students enjoy,"" Walden said. And, at least for him, that's very much the case: ""At last year's Kilmer, my stomach had been actually hurting because I'd been laughing so much,"" he admitted.BOOKS""It's a very peculiar kind of mix of highbrow intellect and lowbrow humor."" —Daniel Walden, CC 'llLAST YEAR'S WINNER (EXCERPT) Edward Rueda, CC 'O5 ""Balloon Boy by Philip Glass"" Balloon boy's flying First a rumor Then a picture Glimpse of sliver Strange and silver Slowly turning Is it burning?

519,"Why the long face, Columbia?",23 November 2010,"Whither happiness? We live in a community that has banished it to the realm of juice boxes and Rice Krispies squares, of coloring books and crayons, of Berenstain Bears and Sesame Street. There, forsaken and forgotten, a quaint vestige from a puerile past, happiness weeps, trampled beneath size-13 boat shoes hurtling toward the future. We're grown-ups now, and grownups—especially Ivy League grownups—can't be happy. As we learn more and more, we find less and less about which to be happy. The world, in all its discombobulating complexity, defies our grasp. The past is too ponderous, the present too unwieldy, and the future too dismal to permit happiness. We sink into malaise. And we begin to take perverse pleasure in our displeasure. We even convince ourselves that it is wrong to be happy. We freely indulge in the privileges of gentrified Harlem, and we're going to be ostentatiously happy about it, too? We cling to a world spinning in poverty and hunger and crime and terror, and we're going wallow in mirth and revelry? Joy, we proclaim, is for the na'ive. We go on, beginning to boast that it is the hallmark of the educated to be cheerless. We take it for granted that smart people are grumpy, and, pretending to be smart ourselves, we act grumpy, too. Increasing knowledge correlates to diminishing happiness—it is an axiom at the core of our culture. We read so many books at Columbia, and how many of them are written by apparently happy people? Was Nietzsche happy? Marx? Freud? But we must rescue joy, bring it back, and call it our own. In a desert of Core dolor, ""Don Quixote"" seems to stand out as a lone, sad oasis of happiness. Literature Humanities was the first time I encountered ""Don Quixote,"" and it lit a fire inside me. The ecstasy, the exuberance of the protagonist, the rebelliousness of someone too drunk with joy to care about the world—it all made me feel like I wanted to be Don Quixote. Still, despite my visceral appreciation of his joviality, Don Quixote in fact epitomizes the problem with our collective view on happiness. Don Quixote is happy because he is, well, quixotic. Caught in a callow world where windmills are enemies, he is able to be happy perhaps because he lacks any appreciation for the complexity of the real world. Eventually, though, he, too, is forced back down to earth where real people with real knowledge fail to find real happiness. But knowledge should not be the harbinger ofdiscontent, and we should not seek to quarantine happiness in a sterilized world of childishness and naivete. Certainly, there is much to be unhappy about in this world. Even in our quotidian existence, in the vicissitudes of college life, there is ample reason to be bitter and despondent. Joy does not suggest obliviousness to these austere aspects of life. Rather, it represents a conscious decision to choose happiness in spite of these realities, or perhaps even precisely because of them. Borne not by the passing peaks in the undulating emotions of normal college life, perhaps our happiness can derive from the inexhaustible knowledge we gain at a place like Columbia. Knowledge alerts us to the darker aspects of life, but it also endows us with the capacity to cast a light on those shadowy spaces and disentangle happiness from the cobwebby corners of academia. Knowledge can bring us down, but why not channel its energy to lift us up to a plane where, suspended high above the constant ups and downs of college, we can gaze down upon life's crevices and clean them up?Often, the noxious fumes of our caustic, acrimonious academic discourse seep into our dorm rooms and pervade the rest of our lives, crowding out happiness. The conflation of maturity with discontent—and, on the other side of the coin, of immaturity with happiness—scares happiness, who is too shy to mingle with intellectuals and scholars, away. But let's save a seat for joy. Let's help it grow up through middle school and high school unabashed and unadulterated, and let's welcome it with open arms at the gates of 116 th and Broadway.

520,Shame leads to knowledge,3 December 2010,"BY DEBORAHA. MARTINSENEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome.Shame is disruptive, disorienting, painful. It comes upon us suddenly—most devastatingly from without, most painfully from within. It makes us feel exposed, vulnerable, self-conscious. It makes us feel excluded, disqualified, unworthy. It makes us want to flee, hide, die. Shame spreads rapidly: We feel shame whenever we witness, talk, read, or think about it. Shame inundates, overwhelms, mortifies. It makes us feel isolated, alienated, estranged. Shame patrols the boundaries between self and others: It tells us what is not appropriate, not legal, not right. Shame is paradoxical: It violates yet protects individual integrity. Although shame floods us with feeling, it heightens our mental faculties and can lead to self-knowledge. Literature Humanities affords numerous examples of how shame relates to our identity. In the Garden of Eden, Eve and Adam eat the fruit, learn they are naked, cover themselves, and hide from God. Their attempts to conceal themselves reveal their transgression, and God exiles them. Shame relates broadly to human identity and guilt more narrowly to human action, yet the myth does not correlate self-knowledge with shame and knowledge of the world's norms with guilt. Transgression leads to both self-knowl-edge (their nudity) and knowledge of the external world (their nudity's impropriety and their action's wrongfulness). But this knowledge separates. Once aware of themselves and of the world outside themselves, they lose their spontaneous, unmediated relationship to self, world, and God.Moments of shame and identity appear elsewhere on the Lit Hum syllabus. Embracing the heroic code, Hektor returns to battle because ""I would feel deep shame/before the Trojans, and the Trojan women with trailing garments,/ if like a coward I were to shrink aside from the fighting"" (Iliad 6:441-3). When Oedipus discovers that he has unknowingly killed his father and slept with his mother, bringingpollution to the land, he blinds himself: ""I do not know with what eyes I could look/ upon my father when I die and go/ under the earth, nor yet my wretched mother/... Would the sight of children, bred as mine gladden me?"" (Oedipus 11.1372-76). A drunken Alcibiades confesses to his companions, ""Socrates is the only man in the world who has made me feel shame... My whole life has become one constant effort to escape from him and keep away, but when I see him, I feel deeply ashamed, because I'm doing nothing about my way of life, though I have agreed with him that I should"" (Symposium, 2168-C). Upon rereading Mr. Darcy's letter, Elizabeth Bennet ""grew absolutely ashamed of herself"" and admits: ""... vanity, not love, has been my folly. —Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself"" (Pride and Prejudice, Bk 2, Chpt 13). Yet shame at one's identity can lead to violence. Raskolnikov commits murder to prove his identity as a su-per-man, above good and evil. He wants to find out ""whether I was a louse like all the rest, or a man? Would I be able to step over, or not!"" (Crime and Punishment, Part 5, Chpt 4). After murdering the pawnbroker and her meek sister Lizaveta, however, Raskolnikov confronts shame's paradox: His extreme alienation reminds him of his deep connection to others. Literature shows us that guilt follows a script: transgression, punishment, repentance, reincorporation into community. But shame has no script. It unleashes emotions so powerful that we want to stop them at any cost. Spiraling out of control, it can mortify us and lead to suicide. By making us feel small or impotent, it can lead to acts of aggression. Yet, as Alcibiades and Elizabeth Bennet realize, it can force us to examine ourselves and our relationships with others, acknowledge our prejudices and ignorance, and perhaps change our habitual ways of looking at and being in the world. By galvanizing our emotions and intellects, shame forces us to examine ourselves, our values, and our actions. Like great books, shame can lead us to know ourselves, to exercise our moral imaginations, to see the world with new eyes. In short, shame offers us possibility along with pain: to change ourselves and perhaps our world.

521,Columbia's Christmas gift,6 December 2010,"Whether our finals-wracked minds will allow us to recognize it or not, our four-week winter break stands only a couple of weeks away. The bliss of unrestricted relaxation is ours for the taking come the end of this semester's intellectual decathlon. We become free to pursue whatever pleasures we have postponed for the past four months, some having to do more with flat screens and duvets than others.Besides catching up, many of us will partake in some sort of tradition in which we receive and unwrap sub-arboreal gifts with the family. I think it important to remind us of a gift we seldom remember. It is one which we are still in the midst of receiving and for which we ought to be thankful. I refer to the gift of education, particularly the Core-centered education we receive at this fine institution that we call home. Undoubtedly, it is humbling to know that a college education represents a blessing. It is a gift indeed that the vast majority of our world, sadly, will never experience. We can do more than be humbled, however. As any gift giver knows, the satisfaction of giving is often derived from seeing that the gift is being put to good use. To see a gift discarded or underutilized is a Christmas tragedy. In the same way, the gift of Columbia's pedagogical tradition lies not in the manner of its reception, but rather the method of its implementation. We can see our training here as the acquisition of all-trumping cocktail party references to Montaigne, Foucault, or Cicero, and we can wield it with all the power that it entails. Becauseeven though it may come across as unnecessarily lofty to speak of the Core Curriculum's relevance and effectiveness, it really does give us powerful tools to apply to our lives. One would be hard-pressed to find a student at Columbia who, upon boarding the plane back home, considers every loose string or open question in his or her life concluded with the completion of exams and essays. I suspect instead that for many of us, winter break frequently represents time to tackle the questions that do not fit snugly into our history, biology, or anthropology syllabi. I've often found myself asking, ""What are my true motivations? What sort of person do I want to be? Is there a purpose to all the work we do beyond our GPAs' heft?""The answers to such questions, should we choose to pursue them, are not beyond our reach. We are not at the mercy of the minds that we encounter around the fireplaces and barstools of home. Instead, by way of Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities, we have been introduced to some of the greatest thinkersthis world has seen. Many have grappled with the same questions that face us now, and they had the foresight to write their own answers down. These answers are not foreign to us. However, they may need to be explored as actual arguments, not meaningless platitudes. Socrates, for example, thought the ""examined life"" was the only one worth living. But do we think so? We have read that Burke considered the requirement of a good ruler to make a country ""lovely to make it lovable."" Does that statement give us pause? Our freshman year exposed us to the tragedy-stricken Job and his steadfast faith in a God wiser than he. Do we consider the possibility of a God to trust in the first place? Yet another, Kant, posited that our motivations, not our actions, define who we are. When was the last time we considered the foundational motivations of our lives? If you did, did you wonder, as Nietzsche would argue, whether your motivations were simply the constructions of the artificial society around us? What we read and discuss in our classes is not simply of use in the echoing halls of Hamilton and Butler. Because ideas have consequences, I urge you to realize that we spend four years developing a blueprint for personal, interpersonal, and organizational development. These expansive implications do not always appear to be the most important ones, though. Too frequently, we treat this priceless education as a means to a diploma. We have infinitely more to gain than a GPA and a degree—we have the opportunity to develop character. Derek Turner is a Columbia College junior majoring in anthropology and political science.

522,Conceptualize This Columbia's lit hum chair tracks the history of individual ideas,9 December 2010,"Columbia's lit hum chair tracks the history of individual ideasby Cathi ChoiILLUSTRATION BY DEVIN BRISKIWe've all picked it up from Literature Humanities: Montaigne is the master of skeptically reconsidering and questioning reality. To think about Montaigne just in the context of Lit Hum, however, is too limiting for Christia Mercer, current Lit Hum chair and philosophy professor. Montaigne's role, she says, extends into the Art Humanities classroom. Though Montaigne and an artist like Pieter Bruegel may have had no real influence on each other, Mercer says, their works complement each other. ""Bruegel's conception of space and reality is so much related to Montaigne,"" Mercer says. ""It's fascinating that they were both approaching the reconsideration of reality at roughly the same time, in very much the same way—just one is philosophical, and the other, you know, is artistic. And that is really amazing."" It's connections like these that have motivated Mercer to begin a book series, Oxford Philosophical Concepts , written and edited by experts in various disciplines. Each book in the series focuses on a specific idea, such as eternity, evil, authenticity, or time, incorporating viewpoints from multiple fields.For Mercer, these ideas and concepts not only transcend academic boundaries, but also have been reformulated with different consequences depending on the time period. Sympathy, for instance, began as a metaphysical notion, and then, with Adam Smith, it turned into something more moral and economic. The history of ""sympathy"" over multiple time periods would be just one of the concepts tracked in the OPC series. This is an unusual approach in that most histories of philosophy span only one period, according to Peter Ohlin, Oxford University Press editor and the publisher of the series. ""I asked her,"" Ohlin says, ""to do a handbook of early modern philosophy—a large collection of essays. She was in my office and she said the world doesn't need that—there are so many other books that serve that function."" ""What, then, does the world need?"" he asked. Mercer mulled it over and realized that shewanted to introduce people to philosophical discussions by including how ""philosophical concepts"" have been discussed outside of philosophy and the historical contexts they have evolved from. We talk a lot about whether something is ""authentic"" or not, but that concept didn't exist before the 16th century, according to Mercer, who goes on to ask, ""Now that's interesting—so what was it about the 16th century that generated the problem that authenticity was supposed to solve?"" Gottfried Leibniz's philosophy of peace, for instance, makes more sense when one understands the historical context. Around the time Leibniz was born, the Thirty Years' War had just ended, which had killed off a third of Germany's population. How to deal with war and conflict is still a relevant issue today, but new problems, such as the question of pluralism and rights, have occupied our agenda as well. ""Human beings go through life and face certain problems and philosophers try to think about the problems and solve them. These concepts are all attempts on the part of philosophers to solve the problem. The problems have changed radically—you know, Machiavelli didn't care about rights,"" Mercer notes.In short, the series ""is an attempt to get people to get the intuition behind the concept, and how that's changed over time,"" Mercer says. The Oxford Philosophical Concepts series is meant to target a larger audience than most top philosophical journals, whose technical natures assume audiences have some familiarity with philosophy. If you are ""a smart person in history or art history or music,"" or in short, just an undergrad, you should be able to pick up a journal and understand it. But even for those who are equipped with graduate degrees and academic expertise, this series will find an audience in experts who want to know how their areas of study overlap with the ideas of the volume. ""We [academics] are all engaged in research, but we don't talk about it to each other very much,"" Pamela Smith, one of the interdisciplinary advisors of the series, says. Part of the OPC project includes workshops thatprovide the space for interdisciplinary dialogue, such as one which Smith attended recently on the concept of consciousness. It involved three to four presentations and a round-table discussion that explored the intersection of each person's research and interest. The idea behind the OPC can be traced back to Mercer's intellectual journey. She had initially pursued art history, but after a while realized her real interest lied in the realm of philosophy. ""What 1 was really interested in was thinking about why Renaissance painters think about space and reality,"" she says. The series, although not officially published yet, has already been met with both fervor and apprehension. Its innovative nature, Mercer says, could scare some historians of philosophy. ""The main idea is to be intellectually stimulating and to not really respect traditional boundaries in telling the story of an idea—in a sense, it's a little bit of a risk because there's no established market,"" Ohlin says. ""But I'm hoping that the creativity and the innovative quality of the books will find an audience."" ® Sarah Ngu contributed to this article.""THE MAIN IDEA IS TO BE INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING AND TO NOT REALLY RESPECT TRADITIONAL BOUNDARIES IN TELLING THE STORY OF AN IDEA."""
523,"Alum discusses his work, his time at Columbia, and penning a new chapter of life after college",10 December 2010,"BY CLAIRE STERN Columbia Daily Spectator""When you get seized by something, something grabs hold of you, and it becomes so interesting. You want to explore it."" Paul Auster, CC '69, authorCelebrated author Paul Auster, CC '69, has a tip that he likes to give to aspiring writers: Unless you're crazy, don't write for a living. His belief is that if anyone actually listens to this advice, then that person shouldn't be a writer anyway. When Auster arrived on the Columbia campus at age 18, he already knew that he wanted to write. Auster has since come a long way in his literary career—his most recent work ""Sunset Park"" was released last month to critical acclaim, and he finished up a successful book tour last week. ""Sunset Park"" explores themes that have intrigued Auster since the publication of his acclaimed 1982 debut memoir ""The Invention of Solitude,"" such as notions of chance, fate, and the search for personal meaning. ""Sunset Park"" offers a fictional yet realistic portrayal of a young man living in the recession, estranged from his parents. His college dropout protagonist, 28-year-old Miles Heller, resides in Florida. There, he preserves foreclosed homes to be put back on the real estate market, and is haunted by the memory of his stepbrother's tragic death. ""Sunset Park"" depicts people ruined by the terrible state of the economy, and Auster uses the recession to bring into question the purpose of individual lives. The themes of failure and despair are classic Auster; he shows that the recession was more than an economic collapse, but a personal one too—he exposes his character's fears and shortcomings. Of ""Sunset Park,"" Auster said, ""When you get seized bysomething, something grabs hold of you, and it becomes so interesting. You want to explore it."" Auster has always been somewhat of an adventurer. His time at Columbia coincided with a period of social unrest, and he left the University briefly to study in Paris. According to Auster, the late '6os was an embattled time at Columbia—students were very feisty and argued with their professors constantly. ""It was and is a rather dismal place—there's something alienating about it,"" Auster said. ""The faculty is somehow indifferent to the sufferings of their own students. The atmosphere that the administration created was one of the reasons the campus exploded in '6B for many factors—the war in particular."" Auster was one of 700 students who participated in the sit-in during the University protests 0f1968 and was consequently arrested by the New York City Police Department. At a Columbia reunion in spring 2008, the 40th anniversary of the protests, Auster found it very moving to see his fellow students who were at the University during that tumultuous time. ""Time lives on very vividly for most of the people who participated,"" Auster said. But none of these events discouraged Auster from spending over five years enrolled at the University. A determined student, Auster spent his undergraduate years taking mostly English courses, eventually earning both his B.A. and M.A. in English and Comparative Literature. As an undergraduate, the Core Curriculum courses—particularly Literature Humanities—had the biggest impact on Auster. ""They're cramming books down your throat every week, masterpieces that most 18-year-olds have not read yet,"" Austersaid. ""It was extraordinary. And I'm so grateful that Columbia had that course, because it opened up so much for me."" The syllabus for Literature Humanities was different in the 1960s than it is today. According to Auster, the course now strives to be more politically correct than it was back when he attended the University. ""It was all dead men we read,"" Auster said. ""I don't think there were any women writers on the list."" Post-Columbia, Auster took a sharp turn in his career, working in the merchant marine for about six months. According to Auster, his experience on the high seas was ""another kind of education."" He traveled around the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Coast, loading and unloading jet fuel form an oil tanker. After earning some money—and a high lottery number that spared him from the Vietnam draft—Auster decided to head back to Paris—and what was supposed to be just a yearlong stay extended into three and a half. ""Paris was a very important time for me,"" Auster said. ""I suppose it's where I really understood that I was going to write, and that was it."" Auster returned to New York in the summer of 1974 and has been living here ever since with his wife, novelist Siri Hustvedt, and daughter, singer/actress Sophie Auster. It's no surprise that Auster ultimately ended up back in New York, where he launched his literary education and career. The vibrancy of the city, after all, was Auster's primary reason for attending Columbia in the first place. Auster said, ""I wanted to go to Columbia because it was in New York. This"" is the great advantage of going there: If you want the city, you've got it.""W Bestselling author Paul Auster sat down with Spectator in the final interview of his book tour for his latest novel 'Sunset Park.'"

525,Our developing nation,14 February 2011,"Earlier this month I joined an audience of more than 100 students at an event hosted by the Veritas Forum. Headlining the event was Bishop John Rucyahana of Rwanda, whose work with the Rwandan government has precipitated a dramatic trend in the traumatized nation. Over the past decade, tens of thousands of murderers, rapists, and arsonists have sought forgiveness from victims and their families. In response, the griefstricken victims have forgiven their former tormentors. This, in turn,has produced communities in which neighbors productively work together, despite the horrendous acts that stain their past. As his presentation came to a close, Bishop Rucyahana reflected on his country's recent progress and the huge obstacles that remain for the small country. He then turned his attention to the students looking up to him. I expected his benediction to center around Rwanda's needs and how we could contribute to the recovery. But he did quite the opposite. He charged us, instead, with learning as much as we could in Morningside Heights so that we could become better Americans and serve our own country with that knowledge. Those parting words struck a nerve. Why is this bishop telling us to worry about America when countries like Rwanda need the types of leaders and educated people that Columbia churns out? Why doesn't he charge us with going out into the developing world, armed with our education and a desire to help countries less fortunate than ours?His final comments reveal his truly unique view of the health of a nation and the reason he's concerned about ours. He assesses a country's progress in more than economic or even political terms; he looks to the spiritual and moral health of its people. Rwanda's harmony and productivity have taken a dramatic turn for the better as its people are finding freedom from their debilitating fury or crippling guilt. Because of this rally around the JudeoChristian values of justice and forgiveness, it is more unified than ever, paving the way for many other types of national successes. This analysis struggles to find traction in today's America. Given our society's postmodern proclivities, any sort of talk about morality, spirituality, and worldview invites a relativistic response: After all, some may say, who are we to criticize our country for its lack of a moral value like forgiveness? How dare we presume to critique others for not adhering to the arbitrary and meaningless dictates of Western Civilization or the Judeo-Christian beliefs that fuelled it! We have reached a point—and I think this may have been what the Bishop was getting at—where we have reneged on Dr. Martin Luther King's fabled mandate of judging each other by the content of our characters. Why? For one, the concept of ""judging"" someone is taboo. Secondly, lately more than ever, we haven't the faintest idea of what good character is. How would we find the standard to apply to that sort of judgment? Today, Reverend King would be best received if he shirked that admonition and suggested that, if we find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of judging a man, we do it after inquiring by what standard he believes he should be judged. Our country has come a long way, though there's much left to achieve. We may have more impressive economic figures, infrastructure systems, and political stability than Rwanda, but the achievements risk coming to naught if our society is not sustained by unified values. Thankfully, the potential that Bishop Rucyahana sees in us students exists in the works that we study. Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization are courses that were originally intended to acquaint the student body with the underpinnings of our prosperous Western society. With those values, generations have witnessed thriving communities and resilient civilizations. The risk now is that these classes are less training in critical values and more detached reviewing of antiquated ideals. If there is anything to be learned from the good Bishop in Rwanda, it is this: We do not have the luxury of passive classroom observation. For our country to maintain the vibrancy of its economy, society, and politics, we need to return to the values that have proven their importance over the course of centuries. Rwanda has been transformed by their return, and I am with the Bishop in the belief that they could do the same for our nation.Derek Turner is a Columbia College junior majoring in anthropology and political science.

526,STAFF EDITORIAL Correcting the core,16 February 2011,"Correcting the coreAs a relatively new addition to the Columbia Core Curriculum, the Global Core is undergoing continual reevaluation. The proposed changes highlight serious flaws in the structure of Global Core classes. Global Core courses have been criticized for being too large, too broad, and too dissimilar from other core classes like Contemporary Civilization or Literature Humanities. The Committee on the Global Core is considering adding more discussion sections to large lectures and increasing the number of seminars, which may reduce the number of Global Core classes offered. While we applaud the initiative to decrease class sizes, we question whether the Global Core courses should be modeled after the arguably more successful CC and Lit Hum. A Western canonical trajectory may not suit the rest of the world. Either way, it's evident that the Global Core suffers from internal issues as well as structural flaws. The survey courses that most students take to fulfill the Global Core requirement often treat varied and complex material in a brusque and superficial manner.Survey courses try to narrativize the histories of huge, often dissimilar regions—the Middle East or Africa—in a linear fashion. This approach means that students are familiar with the texts that they study, but not in an intimate fashion. While the proposed changes may help address the Global Core's content-related problems, we still find ourselves unsure over the Global Core's role in Columbia's education. The place of Lit Hum and CC in a Columbia College education, while contested, is relatively clear.Though most students know that the Global Core's premise is to familiarize students with non-Western traditions, it seems that the University lacks a clear, unified vision—or has just failed to communicate the importance of the Global Core and explain why it exists. We sense this confusion when we sign up for a course that turns out to be ""too Western"" to fulfill the Global Core requirement. Especially around course registration, we find ourselves wondering by what standards—if any—the Global Core is based on.It's evident that the Global Core suffers from internal issues as well as structural flaws."
527,"Double Life Columbia student by day, broadway starlet by night",24 March 2011,"Columbia student by day, broadway starlet by nightby Liana Gergely photo courtesy of Remy ZakenWhile most Columbia kids pride themselves on passing a Literature Humanities test, winning a basketball game, or getting more than three hours of sleep during finals week, Remy Zaken, a junior in CC, has a full-fledged Broadway career under her belt. After making her Broadway debut as Thea in the Tony Awardwinning musical Spring Awakening, Zaken achieved in her teens what millions only dream of. Remy sat down with The Eye to discuss Broadway, Lea Michele, and why a college degree remains an absolute must. What was it like being one of the youngest cast members in Spring Awakening? When I first tried out for Spring Awakening, I was going to Lincoln Center to do a staged reading and a concert version of the show. When I auditioned for it again, it was a workshop for the OffBroadway version. Broadway is the end goal for any musical, but it's a really long road to get there. I think the most intimidating part was when our producer would come into the dressing room and be like: ""Guys, we've got investors out there, and they've got checkbooks, and we need you to give the best performance you have ever given so we can get money to go to Broadway."" Broadway itself is like traveling down the yellow brick road for so long, and finally seeing the Emerald City. Everything about Broadway is different. The process, the space, the music. And then suddenly you have free coffee at every rehearsal, photographers, and meetings with the press.Do you get bored of performing a show every day and more than 500 times? I wouldn't say bored. You kind of get numb to the effects, so you have to really dig deep within yourself to make it seem new to you. For some people in the audience it's their first time seeing it, so it has to be like your first time experiencing it. A lot of my experiences were similar to those on the show, so I would find aspects of my ownlife to bring to the stage, and those would be my best performances. So, you find ways to make it new every time. Recently there have been a lot of serious shows on Broadway Next to Normal, Rent, and Spring Awakening. What is it like performing sucH a serious, sad show every single day? Is it emotionally exhausting? It was draining, but Spring Awakening wasn't just one giant melodrama. ""My Junk,"" for example, was such a celebration of life and love, and really balanced out the other more serious material. How do you feel about having worked with people like Lea Michele before her career skyrocketed? She was a big sister to me. She was always extremely talented, driven. She knew where she wanted to go, and she was very inspiring to me and very fun to have around. During intermission the cast would go to Lea and Jon Groff's dressing room and we would chat and have a good time. It's pretty amazing that she had that fun energy even though her part was so heart-wrenching. Is it weird that you performed with her in one of her first big roles, and now she's so huge? I don't think its weird. She is so incredibly talented and you could see it. I knew she was going places. It's just funny for me because she's everywhere, so when I see her in a magazine I'll text her. So you guys are still close? Oh yeah! The entire Spring Awakening cast is a family. After what we went through together, how can we not be? So now I know you're in Freckle/ace Strawberry. What's that like? It's in New World Stages,where Avenue Q is, and where Rent is coming back! Freckleface Strawberry is a family musical, about a seven-year-old freckled girl, who is struggling to accept who she is. It's about self-love and tolerance, and it's an amazing message: who you are is enough—it's more than enough. It spoke to me a lot, because I was always bullied for being short. Freckles, like height, are things that can't be changed, but they become an important, special part of you. If I weren't this short, I don't think I would have gotten the part in Spring Awakening, to be honest. It has been a blessing. How do you balance being on Broadway and being a normal college student? I'm only taking 12 credits, so I'm taking it easy on myself. Acting is mycareer, so I've made it a priority over school this semester. I always have to make sure I'm wellrested for the show, so I don't always go out, and I don't drink. I have to take care of my instrument. What was your most embarrassing moment on stage? It's live theater: there will be some cracked notes up there. I'll cringe. Roles you'd love to pursue? Eponine in Les Miserables, Mimi in Rent, Natalie in Next to Normal. Favorite thing about theater? When an ensemble member really stands out. If you weren't going to be a famous actress, what would you do? [laughs.] That's why I'm at Columbia. If this doesn't work out; I'm studying psychology, so we'll see. Every actor needs a back-up plan! ®IF I WEREN'T THIS SHORT, I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE PART IN SPRING AWAKENING, TO BE HONEST. IT'S BEEN A BLESSING."
528,Lit Hum cheating sparks fresh scrutiny,30 March 2011,
529,To have a purpose,4 April 2011,"Graduation looms. The real world stares us in the face. It demands decisions. The choice is between two broad conceptions of reality. In one, we, as individuals, have a calling—a part to play in a meta-narrative. In the other, there exists no such concept that provides context to our existence, so you do as you please. To have a calling, or at the least to believe in its existence, can utterly overturn one's post-college trajectory. Sure, the job search continues—no respite there. What changes is that the job search ceases to be a free-for-all rat race for the highest paying or most prestigious position within reach. In its place, a more meaningful exploration of the future emerges The search goes beyond just getting by, to doing what we are meant—perhaps made—to do. The effects of a calling should not be mysterious to anyone who has taken Literature Humanities. Take for example Don Quixote and his valiant attempts to woo Dulcinea del Toboso by pursuing the most incredible feats of a knight errant. Though utterly insane, Quixote embodies what it means to have a purpose and a calling. We witness the transformation from a lonely, old, hermitic man to an energetic, resilient, and unstoppable emblem of chivalry. Misguided and delusional though he might be, his transformation does not hit far off the mark. A calling is anincredible thing—it focuses a person's skills, passions, and education into a cohesive and powerful stream. Of course, there are better examples of intentional lives in Lit Hum—Aeneas, Achilles, or even Elizabeth Bennet. Each has a calling or a purpose that comes to fruition (sometimes tragically) and, for example, reveals that a different man could not have founded Rome. What these tales show is that the prospect of purpose engages the human soul to achieve authentic greatness. This is the reason we neither read about nor feel inspired by characters who pursue life based on what path is most lucrative, productive, prestigious, or popular. The problem is as you suspect A calling is very hard to find, let alone follow. Delphi isn't as instructive as it once was and Jane Austen is not composing our love lives. Instead, we live in an age of seeming randomness and chance. To top it all, we run the risk of pursuing a path that may seem as ill-conceived as Quixote's. However, I find the problem of finding a calling to be of less importance to us at this point in our lives than the issue of believing that callings and purposes exist That is the choice which will make the difference. Naturally, the CCE is unlikely to be the one to tell us this. Its job is to help us find jobs we desire in the industry. Our advisors, unless they're the really good ones, will be unwilling to prompt such personal deliberations. It is entirely up to us to consider this idea for ourselves, and, sadly, we rarely get deep into the implications. When was the last time you had a conversation about whether our futures hold more than a string of directionless career decisions?This sort of inquiry does not have to approach the gravity of the age-old question of what exactly the meaning of life is. Instead, it stops at the more fundamental: is there a purpose? We have plenty of time to figure out what the purpose may be, but the decision about its possibility has an immediacy to it. It has an impact on how we approach this period of life where our career is as blank as it ever will be. With graduation, we set the tone of the steps we take from here. We cannot afford to procrastinate about this one. I envision the results of either choice in terms of momentum. To the student who embraces the postmodern viewpoint of random chance and the absence of life narratives, I can only imagine a mode of life that makes each choice separately. Without a route of some sort, each decision is just as arbitrary and meaningless as the next. The only factors of importance are the tangibles—the salary, the quality of life, and the workplace environment. With even a slight conception of an individual purpose, a mission, the choices we make about future employment become building blocks to something greater. There is a final goal to strive for—a job that must be done which transcends employment or occupation. If there is a purpose, then there is a life enhanced by inspiration and possibility. We're free to choose between the two beliefs. I'm sticking with purpose. Try it.Derek Turner is a Columbia College junior majoring in anthropology and political science.

530,Cheating and Dante's hell,4 April 2011,"BY CHRISTIA MERCEROur Lit Hum books are full of moral quandaries. Was Hektor right to leave his family and return to battle? Was Medea justified in killing her children? What are we to think about Griselda's patience, Cordelia's silence, and Lily Briscoe's self-doubt? Is there anything morally redeemable about Mr. Collins? Puzzling over such moral matters is one of the many joys of Lit Hum. But Lit Hum instructors presently face a moral quandary of a very different sort: How can we at Columbia encourage the highest standards of academic honesty? We must do something, but what? Academic dishonesty taints our relations, both among students and between instructor and students. It only takes a few cases a year to do the harm: A couple students copy off each other's midterms and seem surprised this is a problem, a few ask to go to the bathroom during the final exam to look up IDs on their cell phones, a few buy papers online while others plagiarize major parts of their essays. How are instructors and students supposed to respond to these moral failures? We need to have an honest conversation about the grave dangers of dishonesty. Our academic culture must be based on trust and integrity. Lit Hum not only sets the tone for the rest of the Core, it is—at its core—an open conversation among equals. We struggle together to glimpse the profundity and beauty of our texts. We bond in our delight, fascination, and perplexity. Cheating breaks the bonds and taints the openness that is essential to Lit Hum and to an honest dialogue among equals. It's a kind of violence against all of us. It disrupts, disconcerts, and discourages. Many faculty find cheatingso unsettling, they'd rather look the other way. Some become so incensed, they become anxious about every new set of papers. We Lit Hum instructors want so badly to help our students become better writers, readers, and independent thinkers that we despair at the thought of such a breach of faith. When students break our trust, we have to recalibrate the relation to our class. We feel delight when a student suddenly does significantly better work but then catch ourselves with the worry: Is this the student's work or not? We wonder: Is it disloyal to search for sources online or foolish not to? We worry about worrying too much or too little. The thought of students getting ahead (or trying to) by falsemeans produces despair and dismay. We find cheating in Lit Hum utterly irrational: Students come to Columbia to take the Core, develop writing and reading skills, and engage in honest conversation with one another about our shared literary past. Cheating ruins that. Besides severing the bonds of trust, cheaters are not developing the skills that they came to Columbia to master and that will help them in more advanced courses. They're not preparing themselves to live a rich and thoughtful life. That's not just dishonest; it's dumb. Of course, many students would never ever cheat. In the same way that many instructors have a hard time dealing with academic dishonesty, many students are themselves so committed to honest learning that they find discussions about cheatingdisconcerting. They're insulted by professorial proclamations about the need for honesty. What are we to do? As chair of Lit Hum, I take this moral quandary very seriously. We instructors will educate ourselves about how to catch plagiarists and how to create assignments that discourage plagiarism. We will have new rules (e.g., no cell phones at exams). I hope that we can start using Turnitin or another software that makes it easier to identify papers bought online. (For some of us, the thought that wealthier students can cheat more easily than less wealthy ones by buying an A paper, or trying to, is particularly galling.) There will be discussion, debate, and much gnashing of teeth. In short, we Lit Hum instructors and staff will do everything we can to discourage dishonesty and encourage an environment of trust. What will you students do? You must not ignore the problem. It impacts your academic and social lives. Should there be an honor code? Should there be more thorough discussions during first-year orientation? Should upper-level students volunteer to help proctor Lit Hum exams? How can we work together to create an environment of trust? This is one giant and annoying moral quandary. And the sooner we confront it, the sooner we can return to more important matters. I leave you with a more proper Lit Hum quandary: To what sort of torment would Dante submit the classroom traitor? Here are some suggestions in keeping with contrapasso perfection: He would submit the traitor to a thousand paper cuts around the head and hands; he would have the violent characters in the books unread by the plagiarist tear the cheater apart; he would make the traitor spend the rest of eternity with Mr. Collins. Now this is the sort of moral quandary we should spend our free time considering. The author is the Gustave M. Berne Professor of Philosophy and the chair of Literature Humanities.After Office HoursEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures.

531,"In world of Homer, Plato, boxing makes sense for CU",6 April 2011,"Let's get ready to rumble! Just about everyone knows the previous sentence, even though the sport from which it originated hasn't been a mainstream one for years. Boxing was once a major American sport which capturedheadlines, thanks to household names like George Foreman, Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson. In fact, boxing has been a major sport dating all the way back to ancient Greece. As I'm sure all of you Columbia students remember from Literature Humanities, Homer's Iliad depicts the first boxing fight, in Book XXIII, as a way to honor the dead. The Greeks made it an official sport, adding it to the Olympic games in 688 BC under the name Pygme. Since those times, boxing has undergone a variety of changes in equipment and rules. Bareknuckle boxing popped up in England around 1681. Originally the sport had no rules, but that soon changed with the establishment of Broughton's Rules as a way to prevent the deaths of the athletes. While the rules have been modified over the years, the spirit of the sport is still the same: two people punch each other until one can't take it anymore. This ""two men enter, one man leaves"" idea is why I love the sport so much. There is no greater complete victory in sports than in boxing. A boxer enters the ring knowing that the man across from him is going to try to punch him in the face repeatedly, and that the only way to stop him is hit him harder and faster. The two athletes, typically, spend three minutes exchanging punches, before getting a one-minute break where a coach yells at them about what they're doing wrong. Repeat this process roughly two to three times for amateur boxing (there are many more rounds in professional bouts) and you've got a truly demanding sport. Unfortunately, the sport is not as common or accessible as it should be, especially at the college level.Currently, only 25 colleges nationwide compete in boxing. The National Collegiate Boxing Association (NCBA) splits the country into three zones—the Far West, Mid-West, and Eastern Collegiate Boxing Associations. The types of schools that compete range from big Division I sports powerhouses like Ohio State and North Carolina to military schools like the U.S. Military Academy. Collegiate boxing used to be more widespread, but the NCAA dropped the sport in 1961, ending 42 years of competition. The sport has been absent from the NCAA for too long, and needs to be brought back, especially in the Ivy League. The Ivy League, consisting of the nation's oldest schools, should compete in one of mankind's oldest and purest sports. Take a tour at any Ivy League school and you'll hear the tour guides ramble on about the school's ancient history. At Columbia, we spend years analyzing the works of writers, artists, and musicians from civilizations long gone. So why not compete in an ancient sport like boxing? The Ancient Eight, along with nearly every other Division I school in the country, competes in wrestling, which also originated in the Olympics of ancient Greece. Just as wrestling is kept alive and honored by today's athletes, so should its equally ancient cousin, boxing. Also, like wrestling, boxing is a pure sport that pits one individual against another without the complications of pads, balls, or sticks. A boxer will win only if he has greater skill, fitness, and drive than his opponent. Once inside the ring there is no one to help you and no advantage to be gained from fancier equipment. Like I said before, there is nogreater complete victory in sports. Although the history and purity argument should be enough to earn boxing a spot in Columbia's athletic department, the safety issue is what most turn to in their rebuttal. I strategically forgot to mention earlier that the NCAA dropped boxing after the death of an athlete. While the autopsy revealed boxing was not the cause of his death— the real cause was an undiagnosed aneurysm—the sport still got the blame and the boot. Boxing, without question, is dangerous, but it is not so much more dangerous than football or wrestling to warrant it not being an NCAA-sanctioned sport. The rules set forth by the NCBA are in place to keep the fighters safe, and results in a sport that is very different from professional boxing. Collegiate boxers wear headgear, fight significantly shorter fights, and bouts are determined by number of clean punches landed, not by bone-crushing knockouts. In short, it is not a common street brawl, but a controlled competition with well-trained competitors. Currently, 25 colleges understand that boxing deserves a spot in their athletic departments—it's about time the Ivy League joined the fight.Bart Lopez is a Columbia College senior majoring in economics-mathematics. sports@columbiaspectator.comThere is no greater complete victory in sports than in boxing.BART LOPEZ The Tailgating Tales"
532,Giving It The Old College Try—Again Stephanie staal returns to her alma mater to reread feminist texts,7 April 2011,"Stephanie staal returns to her alma mater to reread feminist textsby Meredith Moore photo courtesy of Stephanie StaalIn 2003, Stephanie Staal, a freelance writer and new mother, felt like she was drifting from her Barnard roots. Piercing cries in the night from her newborn daughter and bickering with her husband made Staal rethink—doubt, even—her new life away from the city. Staal questioned her ability to be herself while doubling as a stay-at-home mom. She was away from her family and friends, and was left to resolve her questions on her own. Figuring out how to combine motherhood and feminism, she turned to books for answers. She decided to reintegrate her younger and older selves by retaking Feminist Texts at her alma mater. Her recently-published memoir of the academic adventure, Reading Women, compellingly tells her story with segments of literary analysis and historical background of the texts she revisited. Classroom presence was a primary component of Staal's resolution to redefine herself through feminist texts. She smoothly reintegrated herself into the academic milieu and didn't let the age gap between her fellow students, her professor, and herself intimidate her. ""I very much took the position of an observer,"" she says. ""I never really felt like I was comingin with any greater knowledge. 1 thought it was such a great opportunity to feel the energy and excitement of the classroom."" Her older age allowed her to connect with certain periods of time more so than other students; for example, when her class discussed the 1970s feminist movement, Staal felt connected to the era through early childhood memories. The age proximity between herself and some of her professors also heightened her connection with the course material. ""It was really interesting to have a professor from my background,"" she says. ""A lot of the students felt so remote from them, because [that threshold of history] seemed so far away."" Staal also took advantage of her liberty to delve further into the texts because she didn't face the constraints of being an overloaded, coffee-crazed student. She says, ""I was looking at it more as a personal reading experience, where the students were concerned about being students and conforming to academic expectations, while I was doing this for my own personal edification to see how the texts fit into my life at a different place."" Staal viewed her learning experience as a challenge that allowed her to reconnect with herself on a deeper level away from her everyday grind. She found that classroom discussion complemented and completed her interpretations of the texts. ""There is something very special to going back to where you went as an undergraduate,"" she says. ""You are not only confronting the memories of yourself when you were younger, but rereading also creates a special dialogue with your younger self, and you learn how you have changed and how your thoughts have developed over time."" For Staal, relating the evolution of feminism to her own evolution as a person was an empowering solution to her personal doubts. Betty Friedan's descriptions of women constricting their aspirations to fit the mold of a housewife re-invigorated Staal. ""This cultural collusion against women was wrong,"" she says. ""Suddenly, I was reminded of my old passions, my earlier convictions, and past and present collided. I sat up a little straighter."" Staal found that her return to the classroom was especially fulfilling because she was able to compare, and reconcile, both stages of her life. Although Staal's solution was unconventional, she wasn't the first student to solve a personal crisis with class discussions and write a book about the process. She wasn't even the first Columbia affiliate. In 1989, David Denby CC '65 grew disillusioned with the fate of literature and questioned how his education was fitting into his career as a film critic and journalist. ""I needed to start work on this book in part because I no longer knew what 1 knew,"" he says. ""I possessed information without knowledge,opinions without principles, instincts without beliefs."" He re-enrolled in Literature Humanities and other courses at Columbia in attempts to solve the mystery of education, and explore how knowledge eludes and escapes us. The uniquely intellectual approach resulted in his self-discovery which he recounts in his memoir Great Books, a narrative about his re-interpre-tations of Western classics by Homer, Locke, and Conrad.Denby craved classroom discussion at his alma mater. He wanted to have a first-hand account that witnessed how current students responded to the texts and how they were reading. He yearned for the classroom setting because he felt that reading the books on his own time would not stimulate his college self; he wanted to question his interpretations in discussions with students at a different stage in life. ""Passivity was not my ideal of a reader's response,"" he says, ""nor could I understand how the works in question could ever have reached canonical status if they had produced nothing more than grateful acceptance."" From a broader point of view, the classroom setting facilitated answers to his overall doubts about a Eurocentric curriculum: How exactly should the Western canon provide answers for a country comprised predominantly of non-westerners? Denby felt the need to re-apply his educational experience to the role of literature in academia in order to feel more assured in his work as a journalist. ""The students had grown up living in the media,"" he says. ""What were they like? What had happened to teaching in the age of the culture debate, in a corner of the university far from the war yet obviously touched by the noise of battle?"" Staal and Denby attest to the possibility of a liberal arts education, and how educating and re-educating oneself is an ongoing process that is exponentially enhanced by the aura of the classroom. ""I was looking at the objective historical background of feminism but at the same time I was looking at myself,"" says Staal. ""Running on parallel tracks almost, to look at how my understanding of feminism had changed and how my life had changed, and stirred up memories of who I was then and who 1 am now."" %FOR STAAL, RELATING THE EVOLUTION OF FEMINISM TO HER OWN EVOLUTION AS A PERSON WAS AN EMPOWERING SOLUTION TO HER PERSONAL DOUBTS."
533,Core Scholars competition to name winners next week,14 April 2011,"BY SONALEE RAU Spectator Senior Staff WriterAround 100 undergraduate students submitted entries across disciplines and media in Columbia's first Core Scholars competition.The contest—which seeks reflections on Columbia's Core Curriculum for a cash prize of s2oo—closed last month, and winners will be announced next week. The competition is intended to ""encourage a conversationbetween different disciplines,"" said Literature Humanities Chair Christia Mercer, who pioneered the program. Participants from CC, SEAS, and GS were eligible to submit works of music, art, theater, dance, film, poetry, or fiction linking different Core disciplines to be judged by an allstudent committee. ""We've seen ... some unexpected pieces. Some stuff that we really just found beautiful,"" Student Committee Chair Joey Shemuel, CC 'll and former Spectator deputy photo editor, said. ""To get students engaging with the Core outside of class is important."" Columbia College Dean Michele Moody-Adams and Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis supported the project, and professor Roosevelt Montas helped organize the program, Mercer said. ""The program is designed in part to encourage discussion—maybe even debates—among students, and since students are involved in judging the entries, I am sure that there been anon-going and robust exchange of ideas, opinions and visions about the Core,"" Yatrakis wrote in an email. ""I hope that it becomes an important and creative part of students' academic experience here at Columbia."" Mercer said that students who were deemed ""representative of their departments"" by department heads and professors in fields including music, art, and film were selected and referred to her for the committee that selects winners. Shemuel said that receiving entries was slow going, but that submissions eventually picked up. ""It's the first year, we weren't really sure. At the beginning we were a little bit apprehensive,"" he said. Though winners have been decided, they will not be announced publicly until next week, Mercer said.

534,Wacky projects take prizes for Core Scholars contest,19 April 2011,"BY SONALEE RAU Spectator Senior Staff WriterRichard Lenz, CC 'l2, just won $2OO for crafting 12 German Expressionisminspired woodcut prints illustrating the fifth story of the fourth day of ""The Decameron"" by Giovanni Boccaccio. Lenz and three other Columbia College students are the winners of the first Core Scholars contest, the brainchild of Literature Humanities chair Christia Mercer that seeks to encourage students to make connections between different Core classes by submitting creative projects and interpretations of subject matter. Amir Safavi, CC 'l4, Dominique Nieves, CC 'l2, and Ben Kaplan, CC 'l4, also won for their out-of-the box submissions. Lenz said he was inspired to illustrate the story of Lisabetta, who places the head of her murdered lover Lorenzo in a pot of basil and mourns his death, after he read the lurid text during his Literature Humanities class. He said he was inspired by woodcut prints done by German Expressionist artists like Emil Nolde.""I chose to emulate their style in my woodcuts for their graphic and emotional power,"" Lenz wrote via email from Berlin, where he is studying abroad this semester. ""Some of the more interesting parts of the process included making charcoal drawings for the prints between stops on the New Jersey Turnpike on the bus to Baltimore at Thanksgiving break, and carrying two 3 by 4 foot sheets of bookboard on my back on a bicycle ride into strong winds from Canal Street to campus."" Kaplan was told about the Core Scholars contest by his professor and said that he immediately wanted to enter. ""I thought this was just going to be a little project I did to show my Lit Hum class,"" Kaplan said. He ended up penning a song that related Frontiers of Science and Literature Humanities. ""I've always been an artist, so my first instinct was to draw something for my entry. But ever since I joined Uptown Vocal [Columbia's jazz-pop a cappella group] ... I've been singing more and more,"" he said.The song will be posted, along with the other winning entries, on Columbia's Core website. ""I think that's the part that's most important to me, actually—the fact that my song is actually going to be shared with the greater Columbia community. For me, so much of the Core's power comes from its ability to foster community in Columbia,"" Kaplan said, adding that when he applied he ""seriously had no idea cash was involved."" For his submission, Safavi, a violinist, decided to use music to interpret Euripides' ""Medea"" from the Literature Humanities syllabus. ""Medea, as a character, is both tremendously vulnerable and yet a force of unbridled rage,"" Safavi said, adding that he spent a great deal of time thinking about whether her actions in the book could be justified. ""At the same time, I was aware that her society marginalized her because of gender and her status as a foreigner. I had written some rough sketches before I heard about the contest. X thought I'd enter so I'd make myself finish the piece before I forgot about it,"" he said. Safavi said he felt that the solitary nature of Medea's struggle could be best conveyed by a work for solo violin. ""The solo violin literature has shown a greatcapacity for showing the spectrum of emotion on a small scale,"" he said.""I still love some parts of it [the Core] and still am not a huge fan of other parts ... the beauty of the Core is that it exposes you to so many ideas and primary texts, creating an environment for you to wrestle with them and, ultimately, accept or discard them as you feel like,"" Safavi said. Safavi said he plans to use his winnings to maintenance his instrument. ""I look forward to purchasing a new set of Evah Pirazzi violin strings ... and rehairing my bow,"" he said. sonalee.rau @columbiaspectator.com""I think that's the part that's most important to me, actually—the fact that my song is actually going to be shared with the greater Columbia community"" —Ben KaplanCORE CRAZY | At top left, Richard Lenz; Below, Ben Kaplan; At right, Amir Safavi; At the bottom, Dominique Nieves, a dancer."

At this point my Lit Hum professor would throw his arms up, protesting that the ""Western world"" is impossible to define because it is influenced by countless ""Eastern"" traditions. While he has a point, take an intellectual leap of faith for the sake of the exercise and assume that the concept of a Western world exists. What parts of the world would you color in? Almost a century ago, the creators of what is now Lit Hum took this leap of faith and applied some color to Greece. Magically, ""The Iliad"" appeared on the Lit Hum syllabus. From there they began to expand into other parts of Europe. At some point they celebrated their seventh birthdays and bequeathed their crayon to the next lot of six-year-olds, who did some more coloring. At this point Columbia students were reading books by guys such as Virgil and Augustine. This magical crayon is now in the hands of some mysterious committee of Lit Hum gods who make decisions regarding the reading list. We all know what this committee has colored in. If every work in Lit Hum work counted as one shade of color, then France, Spain, and Russia are pretty pale, England is two shades darker, Italy and the Near East (counting the bible as separate works) have a full five shades, and Greece has so much crayon on it that the paper becomes three dimensional. America is colorless.The Lit Hum syllabus is already long, and many of the works are staples that will be read beyond eternity. But surely, not all of the works are sacred. Why do we need the Homeric ""Hymn to Demeter"" when we already have ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey?"" Is Thucydides really worth reading after Herodotus? Do we really need four books from the Bible? Meanwhile it seems that other writers are on the syllabus not least because they increase its demographic breath. By literary influence alone, I can't see how we can objectively choose Dostoevsky over Dickens or Woolf over Eliot. By including Cervantes, Austen, Dostoevsky, and Woolf, we broaden the focus of a syllabus that could easily have had Milton, Scott, Orwell, and more Shakespeare.While gladly rejecting the literary hegemony of dead, white Englishmen—but interestingly not dead, white Greek men—by listing works from two women, a Russian, and a Spaniard, the gods of the Lit Hum syllabus have forgotten that American literature had equally profound influences. Many argue that as Americans (mostly), Columbia students have read American works in high school. Yet Classical ""masterpieces"" such as ""The Iliad"" are read widely in high school as well. Ironically, this is due in no small part to the influence of Columbia's Core Curriculum and its signature course—Literature Humanities. By helping to establish the tradition of reading Classical works as part of a liberal education, Lit Hum put Homer on a pedestal in the world of American academia. If anybody wants to argue that American works have no place in Lit Hum because they are already read, then by the same reasoning, we should toss ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey"" out of the window first Don't get me wrong.

Alexandra Wallace Creed, CC 'BB, joked. On Tuesday, Wallace, senior vice president of NBC News and former executive producer of ""NBC Nightly News,"" spoke to the Columbia College's class of 2011 about her struggle to figure out what she wanted to do with her life after graduation. What guided her was looking at the clues to who she ""really was""— exactly what Wallace encouraged graduates to do. ""I looked at the puzzle pieces. I hoarded newspapers. I worked best at crazy hours of the night. Could I make money leveraging this?"" Wallace said, recalling the questions she asked herself. But she_ wasn't always aware of her passions. After graduation, she recalled taking a year off before going to law school, going door-to-door with her resume. ""I do not recommend this,"" she laughed. During her year off, Wallace began an internship with CBS News, where she found herself doing something she loved.""I found myself in drug dealers' homes,"" Wallace said, describing the efforts to get stories. After the graduating class laughed loudly, Wallace insisted, ""I was reporting, thank you!"" Despite her tumultuous search for a career, Wallace advised the graduates to find a place where they fit and to do something they are passionate about. After telling a story about how her kindergarten teacher called her an ""intensely curious child,"" Wallace emphasized the importance of looking within. ""The clues to who you are are all around you,"" she said. While Wallace highlighted the role of her own inquisitive spirit in her career search, salutatorian Elizabeth Lyon also encouraged graduates to keep asking questions. Lyon referenced a paper she wrote for her Literature Humanities class in which she raised questions but didn't ano swer them. ""My professor was deeply disappointed with it,"" Lyon said. ""On the side margin, it was written, 'These are all questions one should be trying to answer.'""

All told, the fund raised $21,341 in contributions and received a matching gift of $50,000. Senior class president Sean Udell closed the ceremony by sharing experiences he had heard from his classmates, ranging from memories of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech and Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election win to the more ""seemingly banal"" experiences of late-night Hamilton Deli runs and long meetings in the IRC. r ""The more I heard, the more I realized that-our memories wouldn't overlap in that neat, tied-up-in-a-bow way that I had hoped,"" Udell said.

538,Valentini takes helm as interim CC dean,6 September 2011,"BY SAMMY ROTH Spectator Senior Staff WriterChemistry professor James Valentini has been appointed Columbia College's interim dean, University President Lee Bollinger announced on Friday. Valentini is replacing philosophy professor Michele MoodyAdams, who resigned unexpectedly last month after two years leading the college. In an email to alumni, Moody-Adams said she felt compelled to resign because of impending structural changes to the University that would ""ultimately compromise the College's academic quality and financial health."" Valentini said that although he doesn't yet know what those changes are, he is committed to protecting the Core Curriculum and Columbia College's commitment to need-blind financial aid, both of which he called central to the College's identity. He added that he plans to work hard to raise funds specifically for the College. ""The dean's responsibility is to ensure the best possible undergraduate education for students in Columbia College. That's his or her job,"" Valentini said. ""How that's done is going to be different in different times in the University's history, but it's the dean's responsibility to make sure that he or she does that. That's what I'm going to do."" During his 20 years at Columbia, Valentini has served in the University Senate, on the Committee on Instruction, and on the Committee on the Core Curriculum, as well as on several faculty governance committees. He is currently the director of undergraduate studies in the chemistry department, a department he chaired from 2005 through 2008. Valentini said he enjoys working with undergraduate chemistry students, but could not pass up the opportunity to lead the college when Bollinger offered it to him last week. ""It [changing jobs] wasn't a trivial matter,"" Valentini said. ""But the president asked me to do this, and I think I can do a good job at it, and the University needs somebody to do this now. So I'm willing to do it."" Bollinger told Spectator that he picked Valentini because of his wealth of experience at Columbia, and because he is a ""very successful teacher and a very fine scholar"" who is committed to the college and the Core Curriculum. He also cited Valentini's science credentials. ""To have a scientist take this on is really important in this particular point in time, because there's a lot of thought going into how to integrate science more into the Core Curriculum,"" Bollinger said. In a joint statement issued yesterday, the Columbia College Student Council and the Student Affairs Committee of the University Senate called on Valentini to fight to maintainthe college's generous financial aid policies, to preserve the Core Curriculum's small seminars, and to keep enrollment in the College at its current level. Valentini said that he spent much of the weekend getting advice from students, professors, and administrators, and that it is still too early for him to make pronouncements about what he will and will not do as dean. CCSC President Aki Terasaki, CC 'l2, said that he would like Valentini to affirm his commitment to the college, perhaps via a video message. But he added that he is already confident that Valentini has Columbia College students' best interests at heart. ""He teaches undergraduates,"" Terasaki said. ""That's a big key right there.""Moody-Adams resigned in August in response to recommendations presented by the Policy and Planning Committee, a nine-member faculty advisory committee that reports to Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks. Moody-Adams implied that these changes would absorb academic and financial decisionmaking for the college into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Bollinger declined to explain Moody-Adams' reasons for resigning. He acknowledged that there are ongoing discussions about how best to structure the University, but said that no changes are imminent. ""There really aren't any changes. It's a process, that's the way I describe it,"" Bollinger said. ""We are always trying to improve the organizational structure, as well as the content of what we do with our undergraduate program, and the college in particular."" Bollinger called the college's undergraduate experience ""one of the great success stories of Columbia's modern history"" and said that proposed changes about the University's structure will eventually be made public. Valentini said Bollinger did not give him details on those proposed changes when they talked last week. ""The focus of the discussion was on what we can do. It wasn't a retrospective analysis of what past issues were,"" Valentini said. ""And that seemed to me to be the right emphasis, is what are we going to do moving forward.""He added that while he is not ""fearful"" about the changes Moody-Adams mentioned, he plans to talk to Moody-Adams to find out what they are. ""The [former] dean resigned and expressed concern about this, so it's a concern of mine,"" he said. Valentini is married to Italian professor and Policy and Planning Committee member Teodolinda Barolini, who chaired the PPC last year, which he acknowledged had created speculation that he might put the interests of the Facujty of Arts and Sciences above those of the college. But he said that this will not be the case, and that he sees no conflict between the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Columbia College. Literature Humanities chair Christia Mercer, who has sat on the Committee on the Core Curriculum with Valentini, praised the college's interim dean as ""a super smart guy with great integrity."" Elizabeth Kipp-Giusti, CC 'l2, took a small class on energy conservation with Valentini last year. She described him as ""a really genuine educator"" who is very enthusiastic about teaching, saying that like Moody-Adams,' he will defend students' best interests. But she also called him quirky, charming, and ""a littlebit awkward,"" qualities that she thinks differentiate him from his predecessor. ""I think that Moody-Adams is a much more statuesque administrator, or academic, that she kind of presents th,is very composed image,"" Kipp-Giusti said. ""And Valentini is a little bit more of a zany professor."" Bollinger told Spectator said he will soon put together a search committee to find the college's permanent dean, noting that Dirks will be very involved in the search process. Valentini said that his experience working with students in the chemistry department over the past six years is the best preparation he has had for becoming dean. He capped enrollment for chemistry recitation sections at 22—some sections previously had as many as 40 previously—and raised money from alumni for a program that funds summer research for science students, among other projects. ""I had an opportunity to make a lot of improvements in the chemistry program by dealing with students and finding out what the issues are, what the situations were,"" he said. ""And that's been a lot of fun, and I think it would be interesting to be able to do that on a larger scale."" sammy.roth @columbiaspectator.com""To have a scientist take this on is really important in this particular point in time."" —University President Lee BollingerJAMES DEAN | James Valentini, the chemistry department's director of undergraduate studies, is the interim dean of Columbia College."
539,What's in a canon?,6 September 2011,"Starting this year, the Literature Humanities section of the Core Curriculum changes again, adding Goethe's Faust but dropping three works—Hymn to Demeter, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and The Decameron—to reveal a new, leaner bookshelf for the class of 2015. The cut in itself is not unusual—the Lit Hum syllabus has evolved plenty in its time, with many texts on the list of revisions having come and gone long before our current batch of Columbia students ever set foot on campus. And, while the change may invite some small uproar from seniors who had to read, Sparknote, or feign ignorance about the few hundred pages that are now no longer required reading, the new 2011 syllabus is less likely to incur an outcry of ""If we had to do it, so do you!"" than it is to bring up the old question of what makes the Core the Core. First-years will not have to be on campus for very long before they are presented with a laundry list of complaints from aggrieved seniors: Lit Hum, especially, is often criticized of being composed almost entirely of dead, white men.The Core Text Comparative Chart 2010-2011 could be said to pigeonhole Literature Humanities readings into a straight-line chronology of the Western world, giving Ancient Near Eastern Texts and Archaic Greek Poetry a small fighting chance before plunging forward from Hellenistic Greek and Hebrew Texts to Latin Literature Under Rome, and then on through the Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods, and so on until we burst out into the brave, new, modern world. For a school that likes to lay claim to a diverse, international student body, Lit Hum can seem like a bald-faced rejection of the fact that the world exists beyond the amorphous geographic region we call the ""West."" Less well-known than Lit Hum is its Eastern counterpart, though perhaps ""counterparts"" may be a better word for the colloquia that exist in the borderlands of the Global Core requirement. There is, for one, the AHUM V 3999 and V 3400 sequence, which furnishes students with a historical Middle Eastern, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese reading list as (or more) formidable as Lit Hum's. Professor William Theodore deBary, who was behind the original conception of Asian Humanities at Columbia, continues to teach these classes as a testament to his belief in the importance of regional voices besides those presented in Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization. How feasible, though, is the creation of a Core that distills and teaches everything? As any Columbia student who took first-year Core classes knows, the chances of getting through just Lit Hum alone without ""accidentally"" forgetting to read a few chapters or double-checking Wikipedia ""just to be sure"" are statistically improbable. Everyone's human. Even the mighty get myopia. Dual-wielding Lit Hum or CC with Asian Humanities, as your columnist tried to do on more than one occasion, is an almost sure-fire way to land yourself in a padded white cell. So how are Columbia students supposed to get a well-rounded view of the world—the whole world—when we can't seem to pin down an inclusive but manageable set of core texts? The overall problem isn't, as I see it, that one canon, Eastern or Western or anything-ern, is more important than the other and should therefore receive a position in our schedules that bears more gravitas. The difficulty is in trying to define any canon—and, by extension, any Core—at all. The uncomfortable truth is that the world is wider than we could ever imagine it to be: Just walk down the corridor and knock on a neighbor's door. Chances are that the person who answers will have a view of race, gender, sexuality, politics, history, ethics, etc., that is staggeringly different from yours for reasons that are deep and profound. Studying where ""we,"" as a collective whole, came from is a global project that requires the detailing of endless influences. Yet the Core tries to do just that: to understand, and to find ways of reaching that understanding. As the Bulletin says, ""the pursuit of better questions is every bit as important as the pursuit of better answers."" Neither Lit Hum nor CC are, at the end of the day, best-guess answers to the conundrum of what a good liberal arts reading list should look like. Their value lies in the question (often screamed at our books, but more importantly at each other): ""Why are we doing this?!"" Why do we read what we do, and should we read beyond it, and why don't we read beyond it? And, on the other side, other canons are waiting: other cores, sans the capital ""C""; other shores.Po Linn Chia is a Columbia College junior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.

540,Engage with the Iliad LAURA BOOTH,14 September 2011,"LAURA BOOTHFor some freshman, myself included, the Core was one of Columbia's most powerful attractions. As an applicant, I read about partaking in this continuing tradition and looked forward to getting to know my fellow classmates over discussions of our first assignment, Homer's ""Iliad."" But my experience, and the experience of other Coreenthused freshman, has not, for the most part, been so constructive. Instead, we have found reading one of the great masterpieces of Western literature to be so boring a task, so deficient in the sensation of grandeur we had hoped for, that many of us threw up our hands and tossed the book aside. I think that our frustration with the ""Iliad"" stems from our belief that, like more contemporary genres, the gratification of reading it would be instant. We assume that no more is required of us as readers than to simply slog through the story before reaping the benefits of its message.Some of this impatience can be expected from a group of people who knows the story of the ""Iliad"" cursorilythrough the blockbuster, ""Troy."" Despite its many inaccuracies, the movie, with its visual depictions of battles and purposeful casting, has a certain visceral appeal to audiences that students might claim the book lacks. I was surprised to find another connection to the ""Iliad"" during NSOP week's Performance Showcase, when one act in particular caught my eye. The Wushu group's art, according to the Chinese Students Club's website, ""is primarily a performing art that emphasizes speed, power, flexibility, balance, and looking unbelievably good. The history of Wushu traces back to the early days of the People's Republic of China when the leaders decided to try to unify the hundreds of styles of kung fu that existed back then."" The relevant part of the routine featured two male performers silently but violently arguing over one of the female members. The rush of breath amongst audience members was audible, the mounting tension palpable as the two male fighters sparred, with one eventually earning the victory. It may not seem obvious, but the Wushu's routine, which evoked such a potent response in all of us, essentially tells the same story as Homer's epic narrative. The Iliad is, at its heart, the story of Paris and Menelaos' battle over the beautiful Helen. Although the plot divulges the details of other characters, many of those are also centered on women-based conflicts. Achilles, for example, refuses to take part in the war for most of the book because Agamemnon takes his prize girl, Briseis. While such objectification of women could be considered offensive from a modern perspective, it is also secondary to the element that makes these battles exciting: heroic conflict. Based on these examples, I think our appreciation of ""Troy"" and the Wushu performance and our simultaneous irritation with the ""Iliad"" has less to do with the differences in their subject matter and more to do with our previously mentioned impatience as an audience. Again, we know the story, and perhaps this colors our vision of the book—it seems a simple enough tale, and shouldn't take more than 500 pages to explicate. But such impatience isn't justified in the context of this great work. There is more to the ""Iliad"" than its admittedly dry prose, and its sometimes difficult, nameheavy passages. As we discussed in my first Literature Humanities class, the ""Iliad"" as an epic poem was once part of a vast oral tradition that has, miraculously, survived into the present. While ""Troy"" is part of a new trend in retelling epics via film and the Wushu's performance gave us a brief look into the age-old traditions of China, the ""Iliad"" gives us something deeper than the instantly rewarding emotional reaction these genres provide. It gives us an extensive description of heroic conflict but requires that we are willing to participate in order to be satisfied. And this was always the purpose of the Core as I understood it: to enable students to engage with the past by using it to understand the present. So maybe the 500 plus pages could be exciting if only we helped them along. And if it takes picturing Brad Pitt as Achilles, so be it.The author is a Columbia College first-year.I think that our frustration with the Iliad stems from our belief that, like more contemporary genres, the gratification of reading it would be instant."
541,"CU backpedals on fringe benefits cuts Full tuition for children restored, retirement is TBD",26 September 2011,"Full tuition for children restored, retirement is TBDBY AMBER TUNNELL Spectator Senior Staff WriterIn response to backlash from faculty and staff, the University has made significant changes to the employee benefits cuts it announced in April. Columbia will continue to pay 100 percent of the tuition for officers' children attending the university and roughly 50 percent for children at other colleges. Additionally, employees will also have the option of choosing an ""80 percent"" health care plan to replace the more costly 90 and 100 percent plans, which are being phased out. Employees still have some concerns, including more costly health care plans and cuts that will make it more difficult for staff to pursue degrees and take classes at Columbia. Cuts to retirement benefits have not yet been finalized. But overall, faculty members said they are happy with the concessions made by the University. Philosophy professor Christia Mercer, the chair of Literature Humanities, called thechanges critical for both faculty and students. ""The recommended changes in April were a disaster. Columbia would have become a secondrate university,"" Mercer said. ""The health and the retirement cuts were simply unacceptable."" The recommendations released last semester were meant to eliminate the $25 to $35 million yearly deficit in the University's ""fringe pool,"" to which departments and schools contribute, and which pays for officers' benefits. But after many faculty members responded to the cuts with outrage—especially members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who tend to have lower salaries than faculty at the University's professional schools—administrators backpedaled. The Policy and Planning Committee—the group of nine faculty members chosen to represent the interests of the Arts and Sciences—has worked to moderate the fringe benefits cuts, meeting with University President Lee Bollinger on the topic. Italianprofessor Teodolinda Barolini, a PPC member and chair emeritus, said that Bollinger ""reacted in a way that I'm extremely impressed by."" Mercer, who is not a member of the PPC, said PPC members worked hard to come up with ""a realistic and practical way of respondingto the original package."" ""Columbia students are not going to be well-educated unless we have top faculty,"" Mercer said. TUITION ADJUSTMENTS After many faculty members objected to a reduction in tuition benefits for children of employees, the University decided to continue offering those benefits at the same level. Columbia plans to cover 100 percent of the undergraduate degree tuition at Columbia or Barnard for up to eight terms for the children of newly-hired full-time officers. In April, the task force on fringe benefits—a 27-member body made up of faculty and administrators—had recommended reducing this benefit to 80 percent for current employees, while grandfathering the 100 percent benefits for new hires. For children of employees attending college elsewhere, Columbia will continue to cover either 50 percent of that school's tuition or 50 percent of the Columbia College tuition, whichever is less. The task force had recommended reducing this benefit to 40 percent for new hires. But in a change that remains from the April recommendations, new hires will have to work at Columbia for four years before becoming eligible for the child tuition benefits. ""We understood there would have to be some trade-offs,"" Barolini said. Employees were notified of the modifications to the tuition cuts in late June. Barolini said that overall, Columbia did a great job of restoring these original benefits but added that there are some others that she would still like to see restored. For instance, Barolini noted, employees who were not seeking degrees could previously take one free course per term—in other words, up to three courses per year. But with the cuts, they will be limited to one course per year. The benefit cuts for degreeseeking employees have drawn even more criticism. Under the new policy, officers admitted to a degree program that starts after this term will be limited to one free course per term. Previously, professors and research officers were eligible for one course per term, and all other officers were eligible for up to 15 credits per term. Additionally, new hires will need to wait two years before becoming eligible for these benefits. Lani Muller, CC '93 and the academic administrator for the Italian department, said that this change will be particularly problematic for her. Muller has taken Hungarian and Russian language classes at Columbia but she will now be limited to one class per year, as opposed to one per term, as an officer not seeking a degree. Muller took beginning Russian last year but will now have to wait several terms before she can resume her studies because she cannot afford $B,OOO for a 6-credit Russian course. This wait will make it harder for her to learn the language, she said. ""I understand the idea of needing to cut funds, but it needs to be done with more sense and sensitivity,"" Muller said. Muller added that the cuts are unduly penalizing people without families, who will not take advantage of the restoredchild-related tuition benefits. Daniel Savin, chair of the University Senate's Research Officers Committee, echoed Muller's concerns, saying that the cuts will make it much harder for degree-seeking employees to obtain their degrees and for non-de-gree-seeking employees to learn subjects that require continuity. Because of these concerns, Savin said, research officers would prefer degree-seeking students to be allowed two courses per term, and non-degree-seek-ing students one per term. Savin questioned the rationale behind the University's decision to limit classes taken by employees because they should come at no extra cost—the University already offers the courses the officers wish to take. He added that these changes could decrease the University's ability to hire highlymotivated people who would like to take courses while working. ""We have no understanding for the logic of their decision,"" Savin said. But changes could still be made. In an email sent in June, the University said it is still reviewing whether or not to allow employees seeking degrees to enroll for free in two classes that need to be taken concurrently. Interim Provost John Coatsworth said that a final decision on benefits for degree-seek-ing employees will be released in a few weeks. TWO PLANS OUT, TWO PLANS IN Administrators have also finalized changes to employee health insurance benefits. Columbia has decided to introduce two new health plans and phase out its two current plans for non-unionized employees. Coatsworth told Spectator that over the next three to five years, Columbia will work to move employees off of the Point of Service 90 and POSIOO plans, which are very expensive for the University to maintain. Under these plans, the University pays 90 percent and 100 percent of health care costs, respectively, up to an out-of-pocket maximum. But in a few years, these plans will become subject to a federal ""Cadillac tax"" created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the health care reform legislation signed into law last year. Monthly contributions for employees enrolled in these plans will start to rise, which Coatsworth said should encourage employee to switch to the new plans. ""Eventually, people will have to move out of them anyway, so we want to do it over time,"" Coatsworth said. ""But we want to offer these alternatives as rapidly as we can put them together."" As announced in April, the University will begin offering a new High Deductible Plan paired with a Health Savings Account. But administrators announced earlier this month that the University will also start offering a POS 80 plan. This new plan will require a lower monthly contribution than the POS 90 and POS 100 plans, and coinsurance—the amount the plan pays—will be 80 percent for non-routine and preventive care office visits. Out of these four plans, the POS 100 will have the highest premiums, the POS 90 will have the second highest, and the POS 80 will have the third highest. The HDHP's premium will be the lowest, but it will have higher deductibles than employees are used to, Coatsworth said, as will the POS 80 plan. It's unclear so far how much each plan will cost—the University will release figures later this month, according to an email sent to employees just over two weeks ago. But Coatsworth noted that the University wasable to moderate the monthly contribution increases for the POS 90 and 100 plans. ""What we discovered during the course of the year was that medical costs were rising more slowly than we had anticipated, and we found other places in the budget where there were savings that we could use to mitigate the problem of the debt overhang,"" Coatsworth said. ""What Columbia employees will face this fall in terms of medical premiums will be rates of increase that they will find more or less consistent with rates of increase in medical premium costs in the next few years,"" he added. ""Nothing extraordinary."" Savin, though, said research officers are still concerned because they don't have all the details of the new plans yet. ""We are concerned that they will be dramatically reduced,"" he said. Several professors said they could not yet comment on the health insurance changes because the costs have not yet been announced. But Barolini said the University is moving in the right direction. She noted that faculty had received a questionnaire about health insurance, saying she hoped the final changes would reflect faculty sentiments. ""People said they would rather pay more up front, and have more protections,"" Barolini said. RETIREMENT CHANGES STILL A CONCERN Finalized changes to the retirement savings plans have yet to be announced. According to College of Physicians and Surgeons professor Jessica Kandel, a member of the fringe benefits task force who is working on the retirement benefits, this is due to complexities in retirement planning that required more work after the task force finished the other projects. Retirement benefits have been grandfathered, meaning that changes will only affect employees hired after they take effect. Coatsworth said that Columbia is working with an outside consultant to make sure its new plans conform to strict federal standards. ""Each time we've come up with a scheme, it's turned out that we can't do it that way, so we have to figure out another way to do it,"" Coatsworth said. ""So that's a technical delay, more than anything else."" Any changes to the retirement plans will not take effect until the 2012-2013 academic year, according to the email sent from the co-chairs of the task force in June. Coatsworth said he hopes the changes will be finalized this semester. Barolini said retirement is an issue that the PPC remains concerned about, stating that it is a ""matter of tremendous importance to this community."" One of the main concerns for professors near retirement is their ability to retain their Columbia-provided New York City apartments after they retire. Faculty members are currently expected to leave their Columbia apartments three years after they retire, making some more likely to postpone retirement in order to maintain their housing. Barolini said this issue of housing needs to be looked at with the retirement benefits by the task force. Coatsworth said he will soon appoint a committee to examine all retirement-related issues. ""We want to make sure that our tenured faculty feel comfortable retiring at the age that they'd like to retire,"" Coatsworth said.

542,STAFF EDITORIAL Suggestions for Dean Valentini,30 September 2011,"Suggestions for Dean ValentiniDean Valentini has emphasized his eagerness to hear students' ideas on how to improve Columbia College. With such a receptive Dean at the helm of our school, students have a unique opportunity to have their voices heard on issues important to undergraduates. We have a few suggestions of our own to offer. Open Course Evaluations Just a week after Dean Valentini voiced his measured support of open course evaluations, President Bollinger formally endorsed the move to make course evaluations public. As students, we often have to rely on CULPA to glean information about our courses, which tends to attract feedback from students with polarizing views. The move to make course evaluations open would allow for alarger sampling of student opinions, including those who don't profess undying love or burning hatred for a particular professor. SEAS already has open course evaluations, and to our knowledge, they have proven helpful. Make the Global classes smaller Though Dean Valentini briefly suggested changes to the Global Core, reevaluating the effectiveness of the Global Core is imperative. The number of Global Core options aside, the majority of these classes are structured as large lectures. Since the Global Core serves as a counterpoint to the Western canon we learn in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, Global Core classes should have a similar structure. Much of the learning that takes place in Lit Hum and CC occurs during discussion, and to miss out on such an enriching part of the educational process for the non-Western world is a shame. There are currently only a handful of options for Global Core classes that are taught as small seminars. Nevertheless, there are undoubtedly too many students in Columbia College to allow for all Global Core classes to function as seminars with current financial allocation.We hope that Dean Valentini understands that we would like to have Global Core classes that are as enlightening as those we take in the rest of Columbia's canon, and can do something to change that. Get rid of Cub Mail Though we are no experts of things computer-related, we do know that CubMail—Columbia's email client—is downright awful. While many students forward emails from their @columbia.edu accounts to Gmail, others just decide to grit their teeth and deal with Cub Mail's utter failure as a system. It shouldn't be too difficult for Dean Valentini to persuade CUIT to adopt a better email browser—Barnard recently made the switch from their old system to a version of Gmail. Martinis with Dean Valentini Last but certainly not least, we would like to see Dean Valentini offer a hip, cosmopolitan counterpoint to President Bollinger's ""Fireside Chats"" or former Dean Moody-Adams' ""Tea with Moody-Adams."" We recommend he inaugurate a series of ""Martinis with Dean Valentini""—spots would certainly fill up quickly."
543,"Honey, I shrunk the class!",4 October 2011,"While many of us bemoan Columbia's course registration process, we often forget the schedule troubles that we faced in high school. Those were the days when the number of class choices was only in the dozens, when taking a ""regular"" class might encumber one's GPA, and when some of us were never able to take physics since state enrollment caps prevented us from getting into the class (Physics for Poets, here I come). For years, I had felt the blow of class-size laws as they stopped me from getting into desired courses and caused administrators to scramble to meet impossible standards. I just didn't get the fuss. Over the past several years, the issue of keeping class sizes small has been the centerpiece of the national education debate. The 2001 No Child Left Behind act ended the $4.1 billion class-size reduction program, bringing the issue to the forefront of the past decade's deliberation. In 2009, President Barack Obama's secretary of education Arne Duncan unveiled Race to the Top, a $4.35 billion education' competition between state's that included class enrollment caps as one of its primary criteria for funding evaluation. Today, despite a continued push for smaller classes, New York City schools are facing the highest number of oversized classes in a decade, with over 7,000 classrooms exceeding their contractual enrollment limits for the 20112012 academic year. Why all of the attention? Perhaps it is because the question of reduced class sizes doesn't have an easy yes-or-no answer. While hundreds of research studies like Project Student Teacher Achievement Ratio have focused on the benefits of smaller class sizes, the results have been mixed and inconclusive. Even in studies that have shown an overwhelming correlation between reduced class size and student performance, confounding variables are rampant. Comparing data from schools with smaller class sizes to schools with higher caps often involves a direct comparison between affluent schools that have the resources to reduce size and indigent programs that can't even afford to preserve the status quo. Moreover, schools often reserve smaller class sizes for students with behavioral problems or on the ESOL track, so poor performance from students in smaller classes is probably a better reflection of outside factors than it is of the effectiveness of a lower student-teacher ratio. A reduced ratio also comes with an immense cost. In May, the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution reported that ""increasing the pupil/ teacher ratio in the U.S. by one student would save at least $l2 billion per year in teacher salary costs alone."" Since the evidence doesn't say that smaller class sizes are inherently more conducive to learning, there is a prodigious incongruity between expenditures and efficacy. At a time when budget crunches have left no state unsullied and schools have had to cut back on textbook purchases and arts programs in order to fulfill class-size requirements, the fact that legislation has been based on inconclusive evidence is troubling. Yet none of this seemed to matter before I came to college. Spoiled by contained class sizes, I had never seen why the idea of adding a few extra students was branded as so deleterious. Then I was introduced to my first lecture-hall class. While my professor was engaging and the material was interesting, I couldn't help but feel like I was missing out on something as I was instructed from 15 rows below. I realized how lucky I had been and how lucky I am. Columbia's undergraduate students are incredibly fortunate to have the support of an administration that sees the importance of small classroom learning. The 22-person Literature Humanities course tucked away in Hamilton is an unthinkable anomaly within an American university system dominated by colossal lecture halls. Yet the advantages that we have in some classes show us where we still have room for improvement in others. When large lecture classes exist, departments make an effort to include supplementary TA-led discussions. However, this system leaves much to be desired. For one, the quality of TAs varies greatly across the board, leaving two students enrolled in the same course with very different classroom experiences. Moreover, this arrangement detaches learning from discussion. Physically separating the introduction of the material from critical discourse engenders an education barrier—in effect, we are taught that learning and thinking are two distinct processes. The recent commitment of the Committee on the Global Core to include more seminar-style courses and to tighten enrollment is a harbinger of good things to come. It is an issue that certainly needs to be discussed in other classes, notably Frontiers of Science, which has made a laughable attempt to have half of the first-year class attend a weekly lecture. Five weeks of college have taught me something that education research in elementary and secondary schools has yet to confirm—size matters.Jared Odessky is a first-year in Columbia College.

544,A Civic Mind how can civic education become part of collegiate life?,6 October 2011,"how can civic education become part of collegiate life?by Laura Booth Illustration by Liz LeeCivic education is a notion many of us leave behind with the Thanksgiving pageants or Columbus Day celebrations of grade school. But several Columbia alumni, and one alumnus in particular, are taking the idea of civic education and its status in America into consideration every day. David Feith, CC 09 and an editor at The Wall Street Journal, is the editor of a new book called Teaching America: The Case for Civic Education. The book sets out, in an anthology-style format, to remind Americans of something they seem to have misplaced in the midst of the longstanding schoolreform battle: the importance of teaching what it means to be a good citizen. The book is a combination of essays written by redoubtable American voices such as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Senator Jon Kyi, and education reformer Eugene Hickok. This project, as well as its companion endeavor the Civic Education Initiative, were both conceived while Feith and his close friend Jordan Hirsch were students at Columbia, working for the politically-minded campus publication The Current. ""It was the spring of 2008 when the initial idea for a book came about,"" Feith says. ""The discussion over the Iranian president's visit to the school invoked questions about the role universities should play in public life. When there was no ROTC program at Columbia, it was a sign—not a good one—of the way the university saw itself in relationship to the country. I think it's a great thing that ROTC is back at Columbia. These circumstances and others like them led me and others to think deeply about the purpose of education.""While much of Feith's book discusses the dismal status of civic education in the American K-12 public school system, several questions are also raised about the quality of civic education in higher education. In the essay ""Don't Believe the Hype,"" for example, Mark Bauerlein writes about the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, which administers a Civic Literacy Exam to college students across the country. In 2006,14,000 college fresh-men and seniors took the test—and, ""52 percent of freshman and 53 percent of seniors failed."" This figure is used to demonstrate that many seniors in college leave school knowing less about the history of America than they arrived knowing, a phenomenon Feith calls ""negative learning."" According to Feith and Hirsch's experience, Columbia is not immune to negative learning. While they generally agreed that the University and the Core provide an excellent environment for heated intellectual debate, they felt that the knowledge to support claims made in these debates is sometimes lacking. ""Is America an imperialist country, a beacon for democracy?"" Hirsch says. ""Columbia helps us ask these questions, but I still found there to be a lack of knowledge behind assertions made in debates over such issues. Part of the motivation for these projects is to make sure that those conversations happen in a smart way."" This discrepancy between the ability to debate and the knowledge necessary to propose a viable argument may be largely a result of Core classes such as Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. While both of these classes aim to make students think about Western ideas of citizenship, they are primarily designed to help students think critically rather than to provide a specific context for the issues. Professor Matthew Jones, Chair of Contemporary Civilization, describes the Core's movement in the last fifty years—away from a content-based approach in favor of a ""great books"" approach—asa positive one. Jones believes that this is integral to the inquisitiveness generally associated with Columbia and its students. ""The reason that it's in a seminar style is precisely that we want to develop your thinking, articulating, debating,"" Jones says. ""And those lessons don't lend themselves to a sort of informational lecture format."" Incorrect presumptions about the incoming class' baseline knowledge may occur, he says. But he argues that this seminar format gives students the, ""tools for thinking through things, so that if you're going to read the Constitution, which you may or may not read in CC, or you're going to learn about the judicial system, or the place of the free press, you're going to do so from a more elevated perspective, a more reflective ability. I'm not sure that I would want to sacrifice the sort of more collegiate-level reflective skills, in favor of imparting information at a fairly general level."" However, such rhetoric-based learning does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with real political action. ""I think that people aren't as involved in the processes that affect them as they could be, and I think that was especially evident on a micro-scale even in the class council elections,"" Jared Odessky, a freshman in Columbia College who was recently elected class president, says. ""People just vote based on what they see. We only had about 40 percent turnout."" Voter turnout is a statistic that has been used to measure civic engagement for decades. Thestatistics for the class of 2015 in the most recent class council election are considerably lower than the approximately 62 percent of U.S. voters who cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. This figure seems troubling, especially given that the entire class had a voting population of little more than 1,000 students. So what is keeping Columbia students from applying notions of civic responsibility in Plato and Homer to their own lives? ""Obviously people are busy, people are reading their Lit Hum books, people are writing their University Writing papers,"" Odessky says. ""But that's the problem."" Indeed, in troubling economic times, the question comes to mind whether people can still afford to worry what it means to be a voting American citizen, in the midst of trying to do well in school or in their profession.But this is exactly the concern Feith is most urgent to combat. ""This is a crucial question, but it shouldn't be at the expense of the education system's responsibility to cultivate informed citizens, and it doesn't have to be. It's not a ""zero-sum"" game,"" Feith says. Although it is difficult to decry the value of texts such as Marx and Sophocles, this shift in the Core is worrying for the future of civic education. Reading Plato's Republic in a seminar setting may teach students how to argue and think, but it does not necessarily make students think about how to be better citizens in contemporary society. ""It is negligent to assume that the American civic order will perpetuate itself without conscious effort from political and cultural figures, teachers, parents, and others,"" Feith says. W""A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE ABILITY TO DEBATE AND THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO PROPOSE A VIABLE ARGUMENT MAY BE LARGELY A RESULT OF CORE CLASSES."""
545,Struggles to find Core teachers continue Declining percentages of tenured professors mean more adjuncts,14 October 2011,"Declining percentages of tenured professors mean more adjunctsBY SAMMY ROTH Spectator Senior Staff WriterMore than a third of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations classes were taught by graduate students last year, and more than 15 percent were taught by adjunct professors, while a quarter of Lit Hum and CC sections were taught by tenured or tenure-track professors. The Core has been the centerpiece of undergraduate education at Columbia for more than 90 years, but for administrators and department chairs, finding people to teach it is a constant struggle. The number of tenured and tenure-track professors teaching in the Core has been steadily declining, creating a need for more adjunct professors, postdoctoral students, and graduate students, and it's sometimes difficult just to find a teacher for every Core section. ""We worry about Core teaching every year. It hasn't changed,"" Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks said. ""Some years we do better than other years. But I mean, it's been a regular worry."" Philosophy professor Michele Moody-Adams raised concerns about the health of the Core Curriculum when she resigned as dean of Columbia College this summer. In her resignation letter to alumni, Moody-Adams cited impending structural changes to the University that would ""ultimately compromise the College's academic quality and financial health."" But administrators saythere is no reason for students to worry about either the College or the Core. And Dirks told Spectator that the Core Curriculum was not discussed in McKinsey & Company's recent report on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a report some have speculated prompted Moody-Adams to resign. Philosophy professor Christia Mercer, the chair of Literature Humanities, said that there are ways to strengthen the Core, but that its problems aren't new. ""I am not concerned any more than I was six months ago,"" she said. 'ANY INCREASE WOULD BE WELCOME' Some departments, like history and English, contribute disproportionately to the teaching of the Core, but other departments keep their distance. Dirks said that he works with departments to set quotas for Core teaching, but those quotas aren't always met. Departments are also tasked with staffing their own undergraduate courses and graduate level courses, and sometimes there aren't enough professors to go around. Of the nine tenured or ten-ure-track professors in the Slavic languages and literatures department, seven regularly teach in the Core Curriculum. But when it comes to staffing the Core Curriculum, the Slavic department is more the exception than the rule. Department Chair Alan Timberlake said that his professors really enjoy the contentof the Core. But that's not the only reason they teach it, he said. ""It seems like a natural place to participate in the University, to have a place in the University life,"" he said. Of the 22 tenured or tenuretrack professors in the anthropology department, for instance, only one is teaching a Core class this semester, save for courses that count towards the Global Core requirement. ""We've made deals with departments at different times, and we've sought to get the departments to ante up to the agreements stipulated,"" Dirks said. ""But it doesn't always work, and then we have to hire adjuncts or others to teach in the Core."" Dirks, an anthropology professor, said that in the 1993-94 academic year, 17 percent of Lit Hum and CC sections were taught by tenured professors, compared to 15 percent last year. But in the long term, tenured and tenure-track professors are teaching in the Core less frequently. East Asian Studies professor and former provost William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, MA '4B, PhD '53, who has taught at Columbia since 1949, said that the proportion of Core sections taught by tenured and tenure-track professors used to be ""much larger."" ""Any increase would be welcome,"" de Bary said. Dirks added that in the 199192 academic year, there were 195 Lit Hum and CC sections, compared to 242 last year, which has made it even more difficult to keep the Core staffed by regular faculty members. ""The faculty is stretched really pretty thin, and we have to treat the Core as a priority, but that nevertheless has to be thought of in relationship to all the other things the departments have to mount,"" he said. Lit Hum and CC in particular have been impacted by those trends, particularly in light of increases in the Columbia College student body without a corresponding increase in the size of the departments that tend to staff these classes. Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said that there is a ""downward trajectory of percentages"" when it comes to tenured and tenure-track professors teaching these classes. ""I'm optimistic that now that it's on people's agendas, we can focus some of our work in this area,"" Yatrakis said. PERSUASION AND CAJOLING But hiring more faculty members to teach the Core might not be enough. Even if departments had enough professors to teach the Core and all their specialized classes, administrators and department chairs would still have to convince individual professors to teach. And for some professors, the Core just isn't a priority. ""Even chairs have a great deal of difficulty telling their faculty what to teach,"" Dirks said. ""They have to persuade them, they have to cajole them."" Many professors would prefer to teach their specialties, and young tenure-track professors especially are driven by the need to do research and publish. ""If you haven't published, you have a hard time getting a job at all,"" de Bary said. ""And you're not going to get published unless you have something special to offer the publisher."" Senior professors, too, are pulled in many directions. ""A senior professor has a lot of different obligations, and it's hard to juggle those,"" Mercer said. Meanwhile, teaching in the Core takes a lot of work—especially Lit Hum and CC, which meet almost four hours per week, involve heavy reading loads and require professors to grade essays without the help of teaching assistants. And in general, teaching in the Core forces faculty members to teach outside their specialties, something which, as Director of the Center for the Core Curriculum Roosevelt Montas, CC '95, M.A. '96, Ph.D 'O4, put it, ""no professor does willingly."" ""The incentives of the profession pull against teaching in the Core,"" Montas said.ADJUNCTS AND POSTDOCS Lit Hum and CC classes that aren't taught by professors, associate professors or assistant professors—all of whom are tenured or tenure-track—are taught by a combination of grad students, postdocs, adjunct professors, a few retired professors like de Bary and several one-year departmental appointees known as lecturers. History professor Matthew Jones, the chair of Contemporary Civilization, said that ""we want as few adjunct professors teaching in the Core as we can."" But he added that some postdocs, who are often hired as adjuncts at Columbia on their way to tenure-track jobs elsewhere, are ""exactly the sort of professors that you as students want.""Similarly, many University Writing classes are taught by adjunct professors and parttime hires, according to English professor Nicole Wallack, the director of the Undergraduate Writing Center. Music professor Elaine Sisman, the chair of Music Humanities, said that some full professors continue to teach Music Hum, but that many sections are taught by pcfttdocs. ""It both cushions them between graduate school and the job market and keeps excellent teachers in the Core,"" Sisman said. Biology professor Darcy Kelley, a co-chair of Frontiers of Science, said that the bulk of the weekly seminars in Frontiers, too, are taught by postdoc research fellows. Most of these fellows teach two seminars per semester—which, Kelley noted, Columbia College defines as a full teaching load—while still doing research to ensure that they can get jobs after their fellowships end. Additionally, a few years ago Dirks started the Core Assistant Professorships program, an initiative to hire postdocs who already taught Core classes while graduate students at Columbia. Dirks said that CAPs are currently funded out of the Arts and Sciences budget, although A&S is working to raise funds to support them. University Trustees Jonathan Lavine, CC 'BB, and Gerry Lenfest, Law '5B, each recently pledged $2.5 million to match gifts that endow CAPs. 'BURSTING AT THE SEAMS' Finding more tenured and tenure-track faculty to teach in the Core is one thing, but just finding someone to cover each section is a challenge on its own. There are some systematic staffing problems in the Core—every year, teachers drop out of classes at the last minute or decide to go on leave, and the number of students from the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of General Studies enrolled in Core cjasses changes from year to year. In the last few years, though, there have been fewer grad students applying to teach in the Core, too. ""We are expecting and have been getting big drops in graduate students,"" Montas said. There are a few reasons for this drop-off. For one, GSAS deliberately decreased its class size by 10 percent three years ago, a change that Montas said is just starting to hit the Core. Another complication is that three years ago, the grad school decided to more strictly enforceits policy that students cannot receive funding past their seventh year of study, GSAS Dean Carlos Alonso said. Grad students had frequently applied for a two-year Core preceptor position in their seventh year, and GSAS had previously made an exception and and funded eighth-year students teaching in the Core. Alonso attributed the decrease in grad students applying to teach in the Core to ""the onerous nature of the commitment to teach in the Core,"" but added that he has lobbied Columbia College to accept Core preceptors for just one year. Yatrakis, though, said GSAS students were never actually required to make a two-year commitment to the Core—rather, the Core was committed to keeping the graduate students it hired for two years if they wanted to teach a second year. She said she hopes that once this confusion is cleared up more grad students will teach in the Core during their seventh years only. ""Those who teach in the seventh year and complete their dissertation, now have an incentive to also apply to be a Core Assistant Professor,"" Yatrakis said. But when it comes to staffing, sometimes the ends still don't meet. In University Writing this semester, a perfect storm of professors dropping out at the last minute and an increased number of SEAS students, combined with a pre-planned ""tight"" enrollment of classes, left UWriting without enough instructors, Wallack said. Since all Columbia College first-years must take UWriting one semester and Frontiers of Science during the other, Frontiers is overenrolled this Semester. Kelley described the course as ""bursting at the seams somewhat."" ""You need more faculty to teach it,"" she said. ""And the teachers are the most expensive part of the Core."" 'THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN THEIR MISSION' Paying for teachers is expensive generally, but paying for Core teachers is even more so, as Columbia provides several financial incentives for faculty who teach in the Core. Currently, the Chamberlain Fellowship provides tenuretrack junior faculty with one semester off at full pay if they teach six semesters of the Core. And senior faculty are rewarded with a summer stipend of $7,000 after teaching four sections of the Core, although they can only get this stipend once every four years. Mercer said that to make the Core ""as great as it can be,"" incentives need to be increased. She suggested that the first time a professor teaches in the Core, there should be a $5,000-$6,000 bonus, followed by $2,000$3,000 rewards for each additional Core section taught. ""We need to put our money where our mouth is,"" she said. It's unclear if and when incentives will increase, but Yatrakis and Dirks said they are working to raise money to expand those programs. Dirks noted that he is fundraising for the Chamberlain endowment fund, and Yatrakis said she would like to raise the summer stipend for senior faculty to SIO,OOO. But Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini said that he has been talking to professors about how they decide what classes to teach, and he hasn't yet decided if increasing monetary incentives will do the trick. ""It's a general consideration of a structure which involves rewards, inducements, incentives, whatever, to satisfy all of the objectives,"" Valentini said. ""Of which the Core is one, but not the only one we have."" De Bary said that while greater monetary incentives would certainly help convince more senior faculty members to teach in the Core, the biggest roadblock is not financial. ""The principle strength of the Core in the past was the sense of collegiality among those who were teaching it. They really believed in their mission. That's more important than anything else,"" de Bary said. ""Trouble is that that mission does not count very heavily in appointment and tenure promotion."" sammy.roth @columbiaspectator.com""We've sought to get the departments to ante up to the agreements stipulated. But it doesn't always work, and then we have to hire adjuncts or others to teach in the Core."" —Nicholas Dirks, Executive Vice President of Arts and SciencesCORE OF THE CORE Mark Lilla, a tenured professor of humanities and religion, teaches a section of Literature Humanities."

547,"GS town hall sees old problems, new ideas",27 October 2011,"BY MADINA TOURE Spectator Senior Staff WriterPerennial issues for General Studies students—finding housing, getting financial aid, and fitting into the undergraduate community—were given a fresh look on Wednesday night. At the General Studies Student Council's first town hall of the school year, held in the GS student lounge in Lewisohn Hall, Dean Peter Awn and other GS deans fielded questions from about 20 students, putting the focus on some new solutions to long-term problems. Students asked about the difficulty of securing housing through the University, and how GS students could be centralized to live together on specific blocks. One student used the example of someone who was offered housing—but only well into the semester, after already signing a lease somewhere else. ""The reason that this problem emerges, and it really is a frustrating one, is that frequently we get an allocation for the incoming class but that allocation's a floating number,"" Awn said. ""It doesn't go down as we get closer to the beginning of the semester—it frequently goes up a little or a lot—so we scramble to [accommodate] incoming students and/or continuing students."" Dean for Enrollment Management Curtis Rodgers said that GS has been working with local landlords and realtors to develop solutions through the open market. He said that GS has negotiated apartment leases that are now administered through University Housing. Awn said that administrators are always looking at examples outside of Columbia, citing students at Teachers College andthe Union Theological Seminary. ""We're not just sitting around and waiting for Columbia to solve our problems,"" he said, though the deans still encouraged students to consider other housing options. Students also brought up the differences in how GS students experience the Core. Currently, Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities are voluntary for GS students, with two sections for each class composed exclusively of GS students. ""It is absolutely presumed that we will make Contemporary Civilization and Lit Hum a requirement for GS students,"" Awn said. The main issue was the cost, he said, calling it a ""wildly expensive program.""Awn also acknowledged that finding professors to teach the number of core classes already in existence is a struggle. ""The issue isn't approving it as a requirement, but coming up with the funds in the Arts and Sciences to be able to fund a sufficient number of preceptors to teach the additional sections of CC and Lit Hum,"" he said. Awn also discussed the benefits of GS' financial aid model—a hybrid model, instituted in 2008, that considers both need and merit—in comparison to the full need-based modelused by Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science. ""All full-need models are based on scrutinizing and excruciating details on your parents, not you,"" he said. ""You play one small part."" Citing the example of a student whose parents are rich but has not spoken with them for four years, Awn said that the hybrid model at GS takes into account the different factors that influence an individual's ability to pay tuition. ""The model we are trying to develop is a combination of merit, which we think is very important, and need awareness to the extent possible only dealing with you as an individual,"" he said. ""We are doing really well, but does it keep with the need? The answer is, only marginally,"" he added. The question of the role of GS students in the undergraduate community came up as well. Nick Hesselgrave, firstyear class president, speaking only for himself, said that GS students feel slightly alienated from the undergraduate community. Hesselgrave proposed the idea that they focus their efforts on integrating GS students with older students—at graduate schools, for example. Awn suggested joining clubs but acknowledged the social challenges that GS students face. ""There has been a real effort, symbolically, to have this integration with the other college students but the social events don't resonate,"" Awn said. ""To me, it's just an age and experience issue, it's not a conscious effort to marginalize."" madina.toure @columbiaspectator.com""We're not just sitting around and waiting for Columbia to solve our problems."" —Peter Awn, GS dean"
548,Alumni gift supports new Global Core classes,28 October 2011,"BY PARUL GULIANI Columbia Daily SpectatorA quarter-million dollar gift is spurring the development of new classes for the Global Core, which is continuing to evolve more than four years since its inception. Five Global Core courses being taught this semesterAfrican Civilization, Sex in the Tropics, Archaeology and Africa, Native America, and Slavic Cultures—were developed at a weeklong workshop this May, the first in a series of five workshops focused on developing new Global Core courses and improving existing ones. Arnold Chavkin, Business '77, and his wife Laura Chang, Business '77, gave $250,000 to fund the workshops. With four to go, the list of global core options is sure to keep shifting. The IS faculty members who attended the first workshop developed eight courses in total, and were asked to commit to teaching those courses no later than fall 2012. The workshop—which Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis described as ""productive beyond my expectations""— was led by Spanish professor Patricia Grieve, the chair of the Committee on the Global Core. Columbia College students are required to take two Global Core classes, a requirement instituted in fall 2008 to replace the old Major Cultures requirement. The list of Global Core classes has been in a state of flux since then, and a major focus of theworkshop was refining what exactly the Global Core should be. ""We don't want to publicize a single template of what a Global Core course should look like,"" Grieve said. Grieve said that the ideal Global Core course should be multidisciplinary, with a focus on primary texts or artifacts, and should either be seminar-style or a lecture that has small discussion sections. Professors are also being encouraged to develop courses that are team-taught, and which feature some subject matter that spans different eras and geographical locations. But Grieve noted that a specific model for what a Global Core class should be has not been developed, emphasizing that there will probably never be a ""single class that all ColumbiaCollege students should take"" in the vein of Lit Hum or CC. But the current Global Core model has come under fire. East Asian studies professor William Theodore de Bary, CC '4l, MA '4B, Ph.D '53, who has taught at Columbia since 1949, said that all Global Core classes should be modeled after the Western Core courses. ""What format of education is best suited to getting students best included in the learning process? Not large lectures,"" he said. While Global Core classes such as Asian Civilization, which de Bary teaches, are modeled after Lit Hum and CC, they are buried among large lecture courses that also satisfy the Global Core requirement, he said. ""Since the Global Core requirements have been stretchedout so far, it's a meaningless requirement,"" he said. Grieve also said, though, that it would be too expensive to remove all large lectures from the Global Core list. ""Because of fiscal realities, the number of faculty, number of grad students, and the number of students we can't just have a requirement met only by seminars,"" Grieve said. ""But we can ask that a large class have smaller discussion sections."" The Major Cultures requirement consisted of courses that were strictly non-Western, to contrast the Western-only Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization courses, according to Classics professor Stathis Gourgouris. Gourgouris, a member of the Global Core committee and aworkshop attendee, said that the Global Core is meant to deal with the intersection of Western and non-Western cultures. ""Global is precisely about the fact that things are intertwined and not separated,"" Gourgouris said. Grieve explained that while many of the courses currently on the Global Core list do not satisfy the new guidelines for Global Core classes, they must remain on the list to satisfy student demand. 'We have [large lecture] courses on the list, but when you have student demand that exceeds what we can do realistically, you have to make a choice as to whether the small class matters more than the availability of a particular subject matter,"" she said. news@columbiaspectator.com"
549,"In a GS Lit Hum class, a variety of views",2 November 2011,"BY KELLY LANE Columbia Daily SpectatorBernadette Murphy started her Literature Humanities class Monday night by saying that she found the assigned reading from Thucydides' ""History of the Peloponnesian War"" so boring that she had her son read it aloud to her. Most undergraduates enrolled in Lit Hum don't have children, but Murphy is a member of one of two sections made up entirely of General Studies students—and shaped by the various perspectives they bring to the texts. The school now offers two GS-only sections of both Lit Hum and CC, including Murphy's Lit Hum section, which is taught by English graduate student Joe North. North has taught Columbia College and SEAS students in University Writing before, but said he especially enjoys teaching GS students. ""They often have this sort of twist in their life story,"" North said. ""A 45-year-old person who's been through a lot can really bring a lot of things that I never would have thought of to the text."" North seemed particularlyaware of those ""twists"" Monday night, beginning the class by asking who wanted to ""opt out"" of the discussion—in other words, who wanted to use a pass admitting they hadn't done the reading. This system recognizes that these students have a lot more to juggle than just schoolwork, like families and full-time jobs. ""People approach the text in different ways. Sometimes you can hear very clear ideologies,"" Raphael Peterson, a GS student in North's class, said. ""It allows you to reflect on your own personal experiences and recognize tHat all these other people have their own personal experiences."" A few members of the class are military veterans, giving some of the class discussion on war in Thucydides a personal dimension. ""It's striking to know that people who have actually been fighting other human beings are here,"" Nick Logan, a student in the class, said. And while students in most Lit Hum students are younger than their teachers, several of North's students are older than him. Students said this hasn't caused any problems. ""In GS, there's no presumption that you're the authority onanything,"" North said. ""It's nice to have more of an equality."" GS students must take two literature courses, but Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization are not required for them. At a General Studies Student Council town hall last week, GS Dean Peter Awn said that Lit Hum and CC will eventually be required, but they aren't mandatory yet due to insufficient funding and faculty resources. ""I feel as if the CC people get more institutional support,"" North said. ""Most of the courses are set up for people in the college, and everybody else sort of has to tag along on their coattails."" Several students in North's class expressed disappointment that Lit Hum is not yet required for all GS students. ""All the books we're reading are things I've always wanted to read but never did,"" Murphy said. ""To get the most out of these books, you need to read them with other people and discuss them."" GS student Sebastian Crisan agreed. ""We want to feel like we're part of it, like we belong just like the CC students do,"" he said. ""Our goal is to eliminate as much distinction as possible."" news@columbiaspectator.comCORE EXPERIENCE Joe North's Literature Humanities section is one of only two made up of only General Studies students.

550,Non-tenured knowledge,2 November 2011,"BY CINNAMON LEWISColumbia's Core Curriculum has always been a topic of discussion among students and faculty, especially in regards to the most immediate representatives of the Core—the instructors. A recent struggle intrinsic to the Core has been the difficulty of finding tenured professors to teach Core classes. For years Columbia has strived to select the most qualified individuals for these positions, pursuing tenured professors as priority candidates. I argue, however, that the process of hiring Core teachers should not be so heavily based oi%,tenure, but instead on student feedback, which would reflect the fact that tenure is not necessary to successfully teach a class. Rather, an extraordinary enthusiasm on the part of the candidate is essential. I measure success by the level of student enthusiasm inside and outside of the classroom, the frequency of student participation during class, the prevalence of insightful discussions, and student understanding of the curriculum. These factors are irrespective of the number of degrees an instructor has. For my first semester of Literature Humanities, I had a tenured professor who was not only an expert in his field, but also received a literary award that semester for a book he had published. Nonetheless, I can't say that I learned anything in that class that I could not have learned from reading the texts on my own. The problem was not only that my professor's teaching style was somewhat dull, but also that he lacked enthusiasm. There were easily two to three people asleep per session. One example of this dull teaching style were our lessons on the Iliad: The depth of the character of Achilles and others were overlooked in exchange for a discussion on the less significant Greek games. We were tested on Greek vocabulary words, like oresteia and kleos, but were never asked to explore their significance in the text in relation to themes and characters.Second semester of Lit Hum rolled around and I had a new instructor—a grad student. And this semester was nothing short of amazing. Discussions were insightful and student-run. The most important thing that my instructor did was connect textual themes to the broader concept of the Core itself. Her level of enthusiasm was unprecedented. Armed with a smile and creative agenda, she made coming to class enjoyable. What's the significance of the two dissimilar experiences? I have to acknowledge that there are students who have had opposite experiences with tenured professors, and thus support having more classes taught by tenured professors. This opinion is valid, given that tenured professors do have more experience and training. Yet I must argue that knowledge does not necessarily translate into the ability to successfully teach a class. Positive, constructive experiences are not necessarily dependent upon tenured professors. The Core will continue to shape the experiences of current and future students. Thus, as long as the Core exists, the nature of Core professor selection will continue to be a relevant topic. Furthermore, I do not aim to simplify the process by which Core teachers are hired. I only ask that student feedback is considered. How about using those evaluation forms on Course Works that students are asked to fill out at the end of each semester?The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in English and comparative literature and political science.Knowledge does not necessarily translate into the ability to successfully teach a class.

551,Taking both sides,9 November 2011,"BY DARA MARANSThe principle of bivalence: Every sentence has exactly one value, either true or false. I recently learned this principle in my Symbolic Logic class and the concept that no statement can simultaneously be both true and false seemed to jive well with my intuitions. Over 8,000,000 people live in NYC; Columbia Professor Achille Varzi is a logician; I am 20 years old. Such declarative sentences are clear, definite, and can be proven. Are such true or false statements to be evaluated in the same manner as all ideas are considered? For example, the notion ""Columbia rocks"" is in my mind quite truthful, even if it cannot be proven and another student may consider it blatantly false. We entered college with certain thoughts that we deemed 100 percent accurate~assumptions about life, friends, and the happenings of the world, thoughts that belong to us. However, our ideas constitute a realm in which logical examination is inapplicable. How can we verify which of our assumptions are correct? Keeping our eyes and ears open to varying perspectives will help inform our search for truth. Ethan Bronner, the Jerusalem bureau chief of the New York Times, addressed a similar issue just last month on a panel at Columbia titled Israel and the Media. Newspaper articles are read through a lens of prior experiences. Bronner told his audience that his job as a reporter is to encourage his readership to question their assumptions, imploring the undergraduate and graduate students present to reconsider their fundamental beliefs, specifically pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Our approach to a narrative may have questionable levels of accuracy, and Bronner seeks to challenge his reader with a new perspective by which to glean the true story. There is much validity in Bronner's words. Just because our assumptions and ideas have belonged to us up until this point does not ensure their truth. Our vision clouded by subjectivity, we are often unable to access a totality of reality as it currently exists due to emotional accounts, personal experiences, and general preconceived notions. Our prior attachments to thoughts should not affect our perception of an idea or current situation, and do not necessarily inform its truthfulness. However uncomfortable or foreign it may feel, we should shed preconceptions that render us incapable of perceiving the true narrative.Without our prior knowledge and assumptions, how is this new perspective acquired? For every issue, conflict, or opinion, explore each side and give it a fair chance, whether you wholeheartedly support or adamantly oppose it. While you are reading Euripedes in Literature Humanities, consider siding with Medea and try to rationalize her side even if it may seem absurd to you. Machiavelli may appear extreme, brutal, and unfair to your Contemporary Civilization class, but what if his political philosophy in Discourses is the best way to create a political society? Attend events on campus that you diametrically oppose, audaciously give the other side a chance. If you maintain an open mind, perhaps you will prove yourself wrong and you will end up siding on the contrasting end. Similarly, our University should take part in encouraging its student body to maximally seek out a range of perspectives. If the administration chooses to invite a speaker that represents a particular side of a story, it should invite another side as well to present a balanced outlook. In inviting Noam Chomsky to speak, Barnard should have invited a different perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well. Our colleges should be augmenting a holistic search for truth, not promoting a singular, particular viewpoint. By exposing ourselves to contrasting perspectives, we challenge our assumptions and give ideas the opportunity they rightfully deserve. An intellectually honest investigation spurred by a budding curiosity will weigh different sides of any given narrative or set of beliefs. We must consider various angles, not for the sake of pluralism itself and a multifaceted existence, but in order to refine the shades of grey and isolate the locus of truth. If we listen to Ethan Bronner and question our pre-conceived notions, perhaps we would discover that Machiavelli is right after all.The author is a Columbia College sophomore.

552,Small wave of double legacies hits the college,10 November 2011,"BY AMY PARK Columbia Daily SpectatorCynthia Campo had notes for Lit Hum before most of her peers had even heard of Columbia. Campo, CC 'l5, is one of the first Lions reared by parents who are both graduates of Columbia College. The Columbia College class of 1987 was the first to have a fully coed class. This year, the 25th anniversary of that graduating class, three college firstyears were admitted to the class of 2015 as double legacies. ""It's weird thinking of my mom being in the same position as me,"" Campo said, explaining that she currently lives in her mother's first-year dorm, Carman. Growing up, Campo said she heard a lot about the Core Curriculum, the campus, and the culinary wonders of John Jay. ""My dad used to say that John Jay had so much selection,"" Campo said. But while the food has changed, Campo's father,"" Richard, said the CoreCurriculum has not. In Literature Humanities class, Campo reads through the notes her mother, Diane Hilal-Campo, CC 'B7, left in the margins of her books over twenty years ago. ""I went to my basement to get the Lit Hum books and read through her notes,"" Campo said. Richard Campo, CC 'B4 said that when he started at Columbia the school was still all-male and that there were only 700 students per graduating class. ""Columbia went coed, my junior year, 1983. The campus looks very much the same as it did, except for all the new science buildings in the northern part of campus,"" he wrote via email. ""Columbia does a great job in maintaining the campus and constantly renovating."" Although the anniversary of the college's gender integration saw the admission of three double legacies, Veronica Montalvo, CC 'O9, was the first Columbia College student to attend as a double legacy. Nevertheless, as more children of Columbia's early coed classes hit 18, the college is bound to see more double legacies. Despite a number of changes over time, Campo said she believes that her social and the academic experiences will be similar to that of her parents. Columbia University is somewhere that Campo said she can feel at home, as it's where both of her parents spent their college years.

553,Part I: Reinvigorating Christianity,11 November 2011,"As I've realized in my last year at Columbia, the biggest scandal post-Enlightenment is how much the university culture has deeply restricted the voices of Christian people. Our university culture presents the idea that all world views—such as Marxism, secular humanism, libertarianism, utilitarianism, sentimentalism—are possible ones, but that Christianity is no longer academically acceptable. Christians who try to voice their concerns are mocked and labeled as ""blind,"" and a relatively simple discussion ensues on why Goddoes not exist. As a Christian, I understand that modern-day Christians have much to be embarrassed about—the Crusades, the destruction of the Indies, and the sentencing of skeptics to death, to name just a few. These are all blemishes on our history, and Christians should do all in their power to wipe them away. But putting all of this aside, my college experience thus far has led me to hesitate voicing my concerns from a religious standpoint. My first encounter with my religious perspective being silenced occurred three years ago in Literature Humanities. Discussing the Bible, my professor questioned that it could be the ""word of God,"" while allowing students' jeers and snickers about people who ""actually believed that stuff!"" As a somewhat timid first-year student, I raised my hand and fearfully ventured to say that Christianity was not much different from Atheism. Christianity is a belief based on faith—but so is Atheism. Atheists read their philosophy and decide which secular world-view they will ascribe to based on reason and scientific proofs. They then take a leap of faith—because there is no scientific proof for the existence of God, He must not and cannot exist. When religious people try to speak about why their view is plausible, atheists often counter their arguments by throwing in catchy phrases by Rousseau, Hume, Nietzsche, Kant, Spinoza, and other illustrious Core thinkers. The quotes have led me to realize that it's much easier to be agnostic or atheistic than to believe in God. With powerhouses such as Kant and Nietzsche giving wellargued and complicated reasons for why God might not, and does not, exist, it is rather difficult to critique what makes so much logical sense. I actually believed these philosophers as a sophomore, and gave up my Christian religion for over a year. In my year free from the ""restrictions"" of Christianity, I tried to experience all the sensual delights of the world, but they were all empty. I tried to validate my existence by placing faith in other people, but was disappointed with artificial niceties—l felt completely void. Because I was always sad, I humbly retreated back to my religion and am proud to say that my regained faith has made me an overall happier person. For me, this faith makes the most sense of the world. From my experiences, people are uncomfortable with Christianity for three reasons. The first is that as jational creatures, we want to believe that our accomplishments are ours alone. The belief in a supernatural being that is benevolent takes away that sense of pride. Secondly, when people break the ""moral code,"" however one seeks to define it, believing in God means that we are accountable for our sins and this in some ways hinders individualism. Those who do not want to be accountable to anyone choose not to believe in God. The third reason people, even Christians, may feel uncomfortable speaking about religion is that when people commit acts they feel are wrong, they are ashamed. When they have turned their lives around, they seek to get closer to God. From what I have seen here at Columbia, many students are uneasy with religion because it leads to intense self-reflection on where we fail morally—myself included. It seems fine to tell someone that I am Christian. But if I were ever to tell someone why he should be a Christian as well, the discussion would quickly turn hostile, with the underlying assumption that I am trying to convert him. It is not the conversion I am interested in per se, but rather the person's reaction. The reaction tells me that in universities, and in public discussions in general, we must have conversations with as much generality as possible, so as to offend no one. I wish I could talk to people about what I like about my religion, where I believe secular humanism fails, and what my religion has to offer without students feeling uncomfortable. Many religious students stick to generalized conversation or retreat to ""safe spaces"" outside the classrooms, as they are pushed into a wall of silence and secluded skepticism. So, let us start with our very own biblical creed from the Psalms, ""In thy Light shall we see the Light."" Let us start with this and analyze why the Christian worldview is just as pertinent today as it was thousands of years ago—without fear of ridicule or scorn.Jelani Harvey is a Columbia College senior majoring in history.

554,Faculty calls for more involvement in Core decisions,14 November 2011,"BY JEREMY BUDD Columbia Daily SpectatorIn 1991, when the faculty of Columbia College was folded into the newly-formed Faculty of Arts and Sciences, longtime professor William Theodore de Bary started to worry about the Core Curriculum. ""It had a terrible effect,"" said de Bary, CC '4l, MA '4B, Ph.D '53, who has taught at Columbia since 1949. ""Nobody took responsibility for the Core."" The CC faculty has never been formally disbanded, but it no longer holds meetings or has any functions. And amid ongoing discussion about the health of the Core—sparked in part by philosophy professor Michele Moody-Adams' resignation as CC dean in August—professors and administrators are asking whether faculty need to find new ways to take ownership of the Core. Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks, who is also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said that FAS has not been able to take the place of the CC faculty. ""The Faculty of Arts and Sciences should have assumed the responsibilities of the schools it took over,"" he said. ""I would like to see them take over interests that the College [faculty] involved itself with."" According to de Bary, before FAS was created, the CC faculty would hold monthly public meetings, and would host ""smokers,"" evening meetings where faculty would gather to discuss issues about the practice of the Core, in between the meetings to discuss the content of the Core.""It was a constant discussion among college faculty,"" de Bary said. ""The people teaching it should have a vote in the direction and conduct of the Core."" FAS holds a two-hour allfaculty meeting once per semester. De Bary described FAS as more of a faculty interest group than an academic body, and said that the Core is rarely discussed at its meetings. ""Meetings consist of receiving reports from central administration and other opinions concerned of the faculty unions,"" he said. One of the few venues for faculty to affect the Core is the Committee on the Core Curriculum, which was created in 1988. The committee has 12 faculty members—the chairs of the different Core classes and several administrators, including the CC dean. It also has student members, including Barry Weinberg, CC 'l2. ""The committee ... deals with broad issues, like should Frontiers of Science be a Core class, what sort of supportsystems we should have for the Core classes, can we coordinate between classes, so that's essentially what this body does,"" Weinberg said. There are also committees to oversee the individual Core classes. The Committee on the Global Core, in particular, gives many faculty the chance to get involved—because Global Core classes aren't limited to professors with particular specialties, like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations are—but many professors remain uninterested, according to Classics professor Stathis Gourgouris, a member of the Global Core committee. This committee is responsible for overseeing proposals for Global Core courses each year. ""I do think faculty as a whole should become more involved with issues about the Core,"" Gourgouris said. ""The more faculty involvement would mean that the way the Core is done or what it is would have to encounter more opinions."" To foster more involvement, de Bary has proposed the creation of an independent ""corps"" of faculty members who wish to discuss issues that affect the Core and increase the transparency of the decision-making process. He said he pitched the idea to University President Lee Bollinger earlier in the semester, but that Bollinger was hesitant to endorse it.Outside of the Core committees, several administrators are involved in Core deci-sion-making, including Dirks, who works with departments to convince professors to teach in the Core. Professor Roosevelt Montas, CC '95, M.A. '96, Ph.D 'O4, is the director of the Center for the Core Curriculum, the administrative body of the Core, as well as a member of the Committee on the Core. Montas called the decisionmaking process in the Core ""tremendously complicated,"" and said he would like more faculty to get involved. ""I teach in the Core, but my job is to administer courses and participate in conversations that determine policy."" Montas said. ""Discussions have dealt with the Global Core, Frontiers of Science, and issues of academic integrity within the Core. Those were the big issues in committee last year."" He added that the chairs of Core classes are frequently responsible for decisions that affect their respective courses. University Writing chair Nicole Wallack, an English professor, and Lit Hum chair Christia Mercer, a philosophy professor, both said they would like more faculty input in the decision-making process. That involvement could constitute just teaching Core classes, professors said. Wallack explained that while she is responsible for selecting texts that are used in UW and the sequence of assignments, each UW instructor is given discretion to select additional readings, and Mercer noted that all Lit Hum instructors are responsible for selecting and voting on a version of the final exam. ""We've been rethinking the curriculum and developing UWriting with the Committee on the Core,"" Wallack said.

555,SoA lights up Lit Hum with tragic staging and Core panel,15 November 2011,"BY DAVID FROOMKIN Columbia Daily SpectatorIntroducing the Sunday, Nov. 13 performance of ""Iphigenia at Aulis"" at Miller Theatre, director and head of acting in the Theatre Division of School of the Arts Kristin Linklater noted that the production was a staged reading, as if to preface the show with a warning. No warning was necessary. It may have been a staged reading, but it was a sophisticated one. The set was sparse yet sufficient. Though hardly extensive, the lighting effects were wellchosen and supported the atmosphere of the play. The performance was also accompanied by Linklater's excellent music selections, which created an appropriate mood of both mourning and affirmation. Presented by the Center for the Core Curriculum in collaboration with the Theatre Arts Division of the School of the Arts and Miller Theatre, and performed by the Acting Class of the Theatre Division of SoA, the play was targeted primarily at students in Literature Humanities familiar with Euripides. Nevertheless, it was open to the entire Columbia College community. The production was the most recent in a series of SoA's annual stagings of Greek tragedies. ""Medea"" was produced last year. The MFA acting students cast in the play made it accessible and enjoyable. Strong leads and an interesting Chorus brought the play to life. Nika Ezell Pappas (Clytemnestra) gave a particularly powerful performance, recognizing the tension between her character's fierce fight to protect her daughter and the inevitable tragedy of the play's end. She was convincing in moments of both strength and softness. Hardy Pinnell (Agamemnon) was also strong, conveying the enormous difficulty of his character's choice and its extensive emotional consequences. He portrayed both Agamemnon's strength and weakness with vigor. However, his exaggerated sobs occasionally detracted from the integrity of his performance.Allison Minick was excellent as Iphigenia, particularly toward the end of the play, when she realizes and accepts her fate. Her emotional arc was convincing and poignant, most notably in her evolving interactions with Pinnell and in her final speech, in which Iphigenia realizes the significance of her death. The well-choreographed Chorus was amusing, and, intriguingly, individual members of the Chorus were differentiated, given their own personalities and even their own lines. Following the performance, a panel comprised of Linklater, Helene Foley, a professor of classics at Barnard, and Christia Mercer, the Literature Humanities chair and professor of philosophy at Columbia, accompanied the cast to take questions and address several of the play's themes. Linklater, a renowned vocal technique expert, discussed her unusual decision to have the Chorus sing many of its lines, a decision that Foley characterized as faithful to the original form of Greek tragedy. The production used an original score by Linklater and David Skeist based on themes from Richard Wagner and Henry Purcell's operatic interpretations of the Greek tragedy. When asked which translation of the play she chose, Linklater identified that of poet W. S. Mervin, jokingly adding, ""I can't say I looked at more than eight or 10 translations."" Mercer commented on the play's focus on suffering, which she suggested was a focus of many of the texts in Literature Humanities, along with the conflict between fate and justice. ""At least in this case there is a kind of meaning,"" she said. The panel also discussed the play's humor. It may be a tragedy, but the full house laughed frequently and audibly. ""It's terrible, but are we supposed to be laughing?"" Mercer asked. ""I think it's absolutely in the text from the beginning,"" Foley answered. ""It's what the playwright likes to do."" Pinnell opined that the humor fits well with the tragedy of the play. ""We all know that when we laugh, we are very close to crying,"" he said. Students interested in seeing the sequel to ""Iphigenia at Aulis"" can find a production of ""Iphigenia in Tauris"" at the Lion Theatre that runs through Dec. 4.""It's terrible, but are we supposed to be laughing?"" —Christia Mercer, Lit Hum chair"
556,Torn in two,16 November 2011,"Have the occasionally dry readings required for Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization taken the air out of your creative wings? Does the excessively formal material and its focus on the structure of functional, upright societies sometimes make you want to shout and beat your chest in a primal outburst? These are urges that have filled the minds of Columbia undergrads for almost a full century (the Core was instated in 1919), but have only recently been quenched by the American movie industry. In the past decade, films based on such works as the ""Iliad"" by Homer and the ""Histories"" by Herodotus have taken very liberal interpretations of these classics—swapping in action and intrigue for narrative integrity—and reaped box office rewards. However, for the quintessential Columbia student, there exists an intellectual dilemma: Should one honor the literature presented in one's classes, or submit to desires for violence and excitement and attend these gruesome interpretations?To simply claim that these movies are deviations from their classical roots is to do an injustice to both. The trend was started in 2004 with the release of both ""Troy"" and ""Alexander,"" which were devoted more to showing Brad Pitt's and Colin Farrell's chiseled bodies than to accurately representing the stories of the Greeks and the Macedonians, respectively. Historians cried foul, especially when Troy reeled in almost $5OO million worldwide, aware that for many, these films had become the preeminent references for ancient works. Little did they know that only a few years later, filmmakers would further shift the focus from history towards histrionics. In 2007, Warner Brothers came out with ""300,"" which allegedly recapped the defeat of the Spartans to the Persians at the Battle of Thermopylae. The movie focuses almost entirely on precisely choreographed battle sequences, featuring, at times, superhuman mutants in lieu of much historical substance The script is barely 6,000 words long—a length hardly out of reach for a verbose Columbia student, and it took the actors twice as long to train fortheir roles by lifting weights (four months) than it did to actually shoot the movie (two). ""300"" opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for directors seeking to exploit ancient history, as it became obvious that audience members would gladly trade any sort of historical or mythical accuracy for prolonged battle scenes and state-of-the-art CGI. The ""Clash of the Titans"" came out in 2010, purporting to be based on the mythological conquests of Perseus. To get a sense of how diligently the movie follows the original myth, one should simply consider the fact that no actual Titans, the original Greek gods, were included in the plot, while the Kraken, an epic sea-monster from Norse mythology, was. A Titan does, however, appear in ""Immortals,"" which was released this past weekend. The film is based on placing King Midas into the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Unfortunately, such a crossover is also utterly fabricated, as are several other key plot points, making ""Immortals"" no more accurate than its predecessors. To get a sense of how egregious these divergences are, simply imagine current inconsistencies like Woody dying in ""Toy Story,"" or Mufasa defeating Simba in the ""Lion King,"" or Columbia being in The Big East instead of the Ivy League. It seems that evenjnven the relatively entertaining opportunities provided by myth as opposed to reality, filmmakers continue to disregard the classics. Maybe such a plan is prudent: The ""Clash of the Titans"" also neared the $5OO million benchmark worldwide, and ""Immortals"" made $32 million in its opening weekend alone, easily claiming the top spot for box office totals. For the average college student, these movies can be consumed or ignored without consequence. But for the Columbian who has taken Lit Hum and CC, the films stand in direct contrast to the books we have (supposedly) read. Support for movies like ""300"" or ""Immortals"" spells an undermining of the legends of Homer, Herodotus, and Thucydides, which have for years been a key part of the Columbia academic sphere. In this crisis of literature, perhaps then we should turn to the literature itself for a solution. Socrates, who is quoted in the opening scene of ""Immortals,"" tells us to seek truth over all else in Plato's ""Republic,"" as only such diligence will lead to a just existence. By that logic, virtuous students should avoid these silly, albeit undeniably awesome, movies, as they are but mere delusions. Then again, in the same book, the character Glaucon argues that humans are naturally evil, and that subsequently hedonism is the most sensible path one can take. Thus, to the box office we go, to absorb all the bonecrunching, computer-animated action we can, even if it means somewhere in the underworld Homer is weeping.Walker Harrison is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in mathematics.

557,Student Week of Action heads downtown to join OWS,18 November 2011,"BY MEGAN KALLSTROM AND LAUREN CHADWICK Columbia Daily SpectatorAfter the NYPD cleared Zuccotti Park early Tuesday morning, this week's ""Student Week of Action"" took on greater significance, student activists said. Over 100 Columbia students demonstrated that by participating in a global student walkout on Thursday, protesting against student debt with nearly 50,000 others, many from community colleges and local universities. ""We really want to point out how Columbia as an institution is implicated in the issues the Occupy Wall Street is addressing,"" Alex Afifi, CC 'l2, said. ""Our board of trustees is largely made up of people who sit on the boards of banks, and our president is on the board of the New York Fed [the state's Federal Reserve]. And Debora Spar, President of Barnard College, sits on the board of Goldman Sachs."" Events throughout the Occupy Wall Street-inspired Week of Action attempted to address Columbia's complicated relationship to the protests, which examine the nature of privilege and criticize the greedof the financial sector. ""I think it's important to think seriously about being a student at Columbia, and I say that in great gratitude to this University,"" Todd Gitlin, a professor at the School of Journalism, said at a panel discussion on Low Steps Tuesday. Organizers behind the ""StudentWeek of Action"" have said they must meet at the Sundial or on Low Steps because they can't reserve space to hold their events. ""This University produces ideas, as it should, but some of the ideas it has engendered... are very bad, very dangerous ideas,"" Gitlin said, adding that the notion of a self-regulating marketcame from Columbia's Business School. Professors who spoke at the panel encouraged attendees to use their Columbia educations to contribute to the movement. Philosophy professor and chair of Literature Humanities Christia Mercer said students should use the lessons they learn from Literature Humanities to ""maintain justice"" and ""struggle against greed."" Others, like Gitlin, warned against letting that same Columbia education lead students astray. A group of students, calling themselves as the Columbia University General Assembly, in the style of other Occupy encampments, gathered on the steps Thursday to make signs for the walkout. But, like their fellow protesters in Zuccotti Park, the authorities intervened, provoking anger and accusations of injustice. Public Safety officers said the students had not registered their ""event"" with the University. ""If you're meeting up with people, you don't have to ask the University,"" Nino Rekhviashvili, BC 'l4, said. ""They're basically telling us that you can't meetup with friends unless you're in twos or threes. They are limiting our right to make connections, to share ideas and have a discussion."" Columbia students said they had been warned that getting arrested at the protest downtown would be a likely possibility, and were encouraged to write down the phone number of the National Lawyers' Guild. Nevertheless, a sizable group from Occupy Columbia crowded into the 116 th Street subway station and made it to Union Square to join others calling for social justice. Yoni Golijov, CC 'l2 and one of the students behind Columbia's General Assembly, said that to his knowledge, despite reports of NYPD brutality at the march, no Columbia students were arrested or injured. ""I'm here because I want to live in a democratic world,"" Golijov said. ""When the routine is one billion [people] starving to death when we have enough food to feed everyone, I think it's our responsibility to disrupt the routine. When the routine is having five empty houses forevery homeless person in the U.S., which is what we have today, then it's our responsibility to disrupt the routine."" Downtown, four helicopters circled above a long procession of protesters, and NYPD hemmed in the borders of Union Square. However, Golijov said the protest at Union Square was ""empowering and inspiring"" for members of Occupy Columbia. ""We don't stand alone,"" Golijov said. ""We stand with millions of people."" news@columbiaspectator.comHEADS UP A demonstrator stands on a car during a protest.POSTER CHILDREN Students from Columbia, NYU, and other local colleges went to Union Square and Zuccotti Park on Thursday in a walkout to protest student debt and support Occupy Wall Street."
558,Retired profs will be asked to downgrade housing,12 December 2011,"BY TERESA SHEN Columbia Daily SpectatorLiterature Humanities chair Christia Mercer lives in a twobedroom Columbia apartment. But under the University's new policy for faculty housing, Mercer could be faced with a difficult choice three years after she retires—move into a smaller unit or get out of Columbia housing. ""Many of us were attracted to Columbia and encouraged to stay here,"" Mercer, a philosophy professor, said, ""with the assumption that we will be allowed to stay in our apartment."" By the terms of a housing policy which took effect in the summer of 2009, tenured professors and other longtime employees who signed leases between July 1,1989 and June 30,2009 can be asked, starting three years after retirement, to downsize or leave Columbia housing. Astronomy professor Jim Applegate said the new policy will change his life plans in a big way. ""I'm going to teach till the day I die."" Applegate, who's in his late 50's, said, explaining that he's healthy, enjoys teaching, and wants to keep his apartment. Interim Provost John Coatsworth said that fewer than 10 professors who signed leases after 1989 have already retired and will be affected by the new policy, but this number will go up as more professors from this group retire. IN WITH THE NEW Professors who signed housing leases were never guaranteed housing after retirement, Mercer said, but this was the practice. ""This is a form of breaking a promise on the part of the University,"" she said.A 2008 letter from then-Pro-vost Alan Brinkley explained that the University was ""finding it increasingly difficult to meet [faculty housing] demand,"" which precipitated the implementation of the new policy. As of 2008, Columbia owned around 7,000 housing units, of which 30 percent were reserved for faculty and other officers. ""The big issue is that there is a shortage of University housing,"" retired professor Doug Chalmers, who still teaches the Core, explained. ""All these new people are coming in, and you need to find housing for them."" Chalmers signed his housing lease between July 1, 1984 and June 30,1989, meaning he is grandfathered into the old housing policy—he can remain in the same apartment for the rest of his life, as can all tenured professors and other employees who had worked at Columbia for 15 years prior to retirement. All employees who signed leases before July 1,1984 can remain in their housing units indefinitely.But Coatsworth said that maintaining this policy for all faculty members was not sustainable and had to be revised. ""The policy limited the available housing stock and made it more difficult to recruit new faculty members,"" he said in an email. DOWNSIZING DILEMMA Retired English literature professor Edward Tayler was grandfathered into the old policy. Still, he said, he will keep the new policy in mind when telling prospective faculty members about Columbia. ""Current policies would perhaps have made me choose Berkeley or Amherst over Columbia when I first went on what is fancifully called The Job Market,"" Tayler said in an email. ""It will certainly figure in any advice I offer to younger colleagues and prospective colleagues."" Mercer said that when she chose to come to Columbia, she weighed the pros and the cons, including what she assumed would be lifetime housing. ""I come from the University of California. They can help me buy a house there,"" she said. While many professors understand the need to make housing available to new faculty members with children and families, some say their biggest concern with the new policy is the lack of good units for professors to downsize into. Mercersaid it's ""ridiculous"" to expect a professor to ""move into some hole in the wall, out of a very big apartment."" ""It's one thing to ask people to move, it's another to ask them to move into a crappy little apartment,"" she said. ""So it would not seem as outrageous if there were decent smaller apartments for people to move into."" For Applegate, the prospect of leaving Columbia housing is just as infeasible as downsizing. Even though rent at Columbia housing is significantly lower than most New York City housing, it's still rising, and Applegate said he can't see himself testing the market after years receiving a professor's salary. ""Most of us who retire simply can't afford an apartment on the open market that approaches what we have in this neighborhood,"" he said. Columbia does have a Housing Assistance Program for those who don't choose Columbia housing. Faculty members who do not live in University housing are provided with compensation—s22,ooo per year for non-tenured faculty members and $40,000 per year for tenured faculty members. TO RETIRE, OR NOT TO RETIRE Applegate isn't the only professor who thinks the new policy might affect when he retires. With no mandatory retirement age, some are concerned that the new policy will push older professors to postpone retirement, taking up apartments that would otherwise be given to newly hired faculty. Chalmers said professors might ""want to stretch out your employment with the University forever so you don't have to dig up the mean bucks to buy a new apartment."" In part to address the housing concerns, Coatsworth created a work group this semester to examine barriers to retirement and to recommend any needed changes in policies, procedures, or resources for retirees. ""We want to make sure that our tenured faculty feel comfortable retiring at the age that they would like to retire, and that... they don't stay on longer than they would like to because they have worries that they think the University could address but hasn't,"" he said in an interview earlier this semester. Some professors think the housing problems could be solved by easing the pressure on faculty housing stock. Chalmers, for instance, noted that Columbia has already extended the Housing Assistance Program through June 30,2013. However, he acknowledged, apartments in New York could cost millions, and the supplements may not be enough. ""One way out is if they build more housing,"" he said. ""With Manhattanville, it's a possibility that they might insert some faculty housing there. But that is a very expensive and long-term goal."" Applegate thinks the administration still has time to change the housing policy. ""I would wager a fairly large amount of money that this policy will be modified in the next couple of years,"" he said. 'You can't write down policies that contain powerful disincentives to retire."" news@columbiaspectator.com""With Manhattanville, it's a possibility that they might insert some faculty housing there.

559,"Student filmmaker, actor still on a 'hardcore Columbian odyssey'",2 February 2012,"BY MICHAL GREENSPAN AND JADE BONACOLTA Columbia Daily SpectatorCall Pat Blute, CC 'l2, on a random Wednesday evening, and you may find him amid crazy background noise running First Wednesday Travel Trivia at Village Pourhouse. It's one way that Blute, also well-known for his Bwog video series ""Bwog Weather"" and ""HardCore,"" allows his humor to make a name for himself around campus. He is taking on his next challenge as the writer and director of ""Spears,"" a production that tells the story of the New Testament through the music of Britney Spears. In his work and personal life, Blute said that he tries to keep it light. For Blute, that attitude has grown out of odd life experiences—in high school, he won a free trip around the world. ""A lot of the way I try to engage with people is just to be open to anything and everything,"" Blute said. ""I don't know how to take life too seriously."" Blute will do anything to capture what he called the ""hardcore Columbia odyssey."" ""I believe in turning something totally boring like weather into something extravagant,"" he said. ""In the videos, I'm painting, making omelets, I jumped into the Hudson."" Blute has been very involved in the entertainment scene at Columbia over the past four years, from acting out a cultish COOP leader in the Varsity Show to producing a short film for the Columbia College Senior Fund. ""I dodge around all different arenas of the creative world. I'm comfortable both on stage and behind the camera—l try not to pigeonhole myself and have tried out all different capacities to be thebest at what I do,"" Blute said. Although he came up with the idea for ""Spears"" five years ago, Blute wrote the script while taking a semester on an island off the coast of Australia. ""I would listen to my iPod every day ... and just going through the random shuffle, some Britney would come on and it would be like, ""You know what, that project that I came up with years ago, that just seems relevant right now,'"" Blute said. Even the faculty is excited for the performance in April. ""My inclination is to think that anything Pat does is awesome, but the fact that it's a commentary on the gospel somehow ... just amuses me,"" said Christia Mercer, professor of philosophy and chair of Literature Humanities, who appeared in Blute's HardCore videos. Regarding the five-year gap between conception and production of the show, Blute said, ""Believe it or not, it took a really, really long time and a really, really overcomplicated analysis of what this could be and what this show would stand for."" Blute—who was raised Catholic and had always been interested in history—is aware of the show's potential for controversy, but hopes the show will be refreshing. ""It is an extremely tasteful piece and it is an extremely respectful piece, and it's also a piece that will leave you engaged in the type of conversation and thought that you would expect from a Columbia production,"" Blute said. To Blute, ""Spears"" is just the latest chapter of a performing career that began at the age of 10. Since then, he said, his main outlook on life has been ""being open to whatever comes your way... and love whatever you're doing. Love what it is. Love everyone that's a part of it."" arts@columbiaspectator.comCAMPUS CHARACTER I Campus theater fixture, Pat Blute, CC 'l2, says that he likes to take chances and live advenurously.

560,Admins hope to endow Core Campaign still in early planning stages,10 February 2012,"Campaign still in early planning stagesBY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterSenior administrators are planning to establish an endowment for the Core Curriculum to help ensure its long-term sustainability. Alumni, faculty members, and administrators have been discussing ideas for a broadbased fundraising initiative since the fall. University President Lee Bollinger said that the plan for the endowment is still being pieced together, but that by the end of the semester it should be ""pretty well shaped-up."" ""I think that there will be a lot of people who will find this appealing to support,"" he said. ""We're bringing the college, the faculty, and the curriculum much closer together, so that's kind of the goal. The more that happens, the more people will want to give-both for what they've been giving and more broadly."" As Columbia's capital campaign has surged past its initial goal of $4 billion and toward its new goal of $5 billion, Bollinger said he is hopeful that a ""sub-campaign"" could be established in support ofundergraduate education. ""I think that there is no question that we will have a campaign to get a greater endowment for the Core,"" he said. ""And I think we will expand that and include it as part of a campaign for all undergraduate teaching and faculty departments as well."" Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks said that the Core endowment would be a ""wonderful opportunity"" to solidify support for the curriculum, especially considering the unique logistical demands of the Core and the outsize share of Columbia College students' educations that it takes up. ""We're always interested in finding greater levels of support for the Core because it's a very time-intensive mode of education,"" he said. ""We're all keen to find ways to support what is an extraordinarily complicated and difficult curriculum to mount."" The Core requires the staffing of many small sections each year, making it an expensive program. Finding enough professors and graduate students to teach every semester can be a challenge, and some have said there should be more financial incentives for tenured and ten-ure-track faculty to teach Core classes. Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini is one of several administrators who have been involved in discussions about a Core endowment. He said that although no decisions have been made about how an endowment would be allocated, some of it could go toward incentivizing senior faculty members to teach courses like LiteratureHumanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""Endow means enhance, in this case,"" Valentini said. ""If something is important to you, you want to establish a base of funding that guarantees its existence in perpetuity.""Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis added that, ""since the Core is the intellectual and curricular signature of the College, one of the first issues we will want to address is the normative one ... what should be the percentage of tenure and ten-ure-track faculty teaching in the Core."" Valentini explained that he is working with other administrators to develop a detailed plan for a Core endowment that would outline its goals and explore ways of achieving them. He has also spent time talking to alumni about what a Core endowment would look like. ""Endowing the Core is both establishing money for it and also getting money to make it better,"" he said. ""If something is a priority to you, you find a special line of funding for it.""Dirks agreed that it is important to encourage senior faculty to participate in the Core. ""We want to make sure that we get more and more senior faculty teaching in the Core,"" Dirks said. ""It also makes clear the commitment of the institution as a whole to the importance of the Core."" Dirks, who is teaching a section of Contemporary Civilization for the first time this semester, also expressed interest in establishing more support for Art Humanities and Music Humanities. ""I would like very much to include them, eventually in the ideas of endowing the Core,"" he said. ""The only way to really keep them going and ensure that they keep going is to get an endowment for that as well."" As administrators work to transition the Core endowment from an idea to a formal initiative, they have been'talking to many alumni, including representatives from the Columbia College Board of Visitors. ""We are working with alumni ... to ensure that it [the Core] gets more support even now, but also for future generations so that it doesn't get cut for. the wrong reasons,"" Dirks said. 'The endowment is still in its preliminary planning stages, but Valentini said that he is looking to broaden the discussion. ""Lots of people have investment in it—emotional, psychological, intellectual, financial investments,"" he said.

561,How Ron Paul rocked our family,10 February 2012,"BY JO ANN CAVALLOFour years ago I voted for Obama primarily because of his foreign policy stance: While he had pledged to bring our troops home from Iraq upon taking office, his opponent seemed to be itching to start yet another land war in Asia, glibly altering an old Beach Boys song to ""Bomb-Bomb-Iran."" As our country subsequently continued in the direction of increased military intervention, greater income disparity, restricted civil liberties, and more power appropriated by the executive branch, my only consolation was to think that it could have been worse. Then last September my 17-year-old son asked me to watch a presidential primary debate with him. I was certainly not expecting truths we had found in hard-hitting documentaries like ""Why We Fight,"" ""The Corporation,"" and ""Manufacturing Consent"" to be spoken by a Republican candidate running for president, yet there was this congressman from Texas condemning preemptive, undeclared wars as militaristic nation-building that actually undermined our national security. Ron Paul—where had he been all this time? The more accurate question, as it turned out, was ""Where had we been?"" Congressman Paul had been opposing the endless wars and other unconstitutional measures for decades. As an expert in monetary policy, moreover, he exposed the role of the Federal Reserve not only in war financing, but also in currency devaluation, vast debt accumulation, artificial boom-bust cycles, and even our loss of civil liberties, as he details in his book ""End the Fed."" Given that a partial audit of the Fed—thanks to Paul's relentless efforts—had revealed secret bailouts of trillions of dollars to both foreign and domestic banks and institutions, it began to concern me that Goldman Sachs and its cohorts—the same banks that profited from the government bailouts-were top contributors to both Obama's and Romney's campaigns. Rereading Thomas More's ""Utopia"" in preparation for my class, Nobility and Civility: East and West, I came upon the question of how a king would respond were he to be shown that ""all this war-mongering, by which so many different nations were kept in turmoil for his sake, would exhaust his treasury and demoralize his people, yet in the end come to nothing through one mishap or another."" What if rather than a king, we have a two-party political class serving monolithic corporations who also conveniently control mainstream media? Might that be why the establishment isn't willing to present Ron Paul honestly, either treating him as ""the 13th floor in a hotel,"" as Jon Stewart quipped, or distorting his views through biased coverage? Despite the media blackout and outright hit pieces, our ""Daily Paul"" study breaks revealed impassioned responses to Paul's message from both within and beyond our nation. In the past months I've seen Dr. Paul likened to ""a clean boat in a sea of garbage,"" a rock star, a Jedi knight, a prophet, and Don Quixote. One significant difference with respect to the latter figure, at least, is that the giants Paul has been challenging (the military-industrial complex, crony corporatism,the Federal Reserve) are all too real, even though they are largely hidden from view. Having set my homepage to the Daily Paul, I reactivated my Facebook account to post Paul-related articles, switched my affiliation from independent to Republican to vote in the primaries, and began shopping at the campaign's online store. My son brought in rally signs to his high school teachers for their classrooms and started a Youth for Ron Paul chapter at Columbia within minutes of enrolling as an incoming freshman. Our concentrated focus on Paulrelated news was initially disconcerting to my daughter, a Columbia College sophomore. Over Thanksgiving break she complained of feeling displaced by a new baby in the family and sought help from Yahoo! Answers: ""My family is obsessed with politics! They're driving me nuts. What can I do?"" (Ironically, the best answer came from someone with the opposite problem who offered to trade parents.) Yet by semester's end she was relating Ron Paul to her CC readings, especially Locke on the government's role to protect the natural rights of liberty and property. When she started playing Ron Paul songs on You Tube and phoning-ffom-home, I knew she was a Ronvert! She even succeeded in convincing her grandmother to vote for the first time since the 19605.As the three of us followed the news together over winter break, we asked ourselves how President Obama could have signed the ACTA (global internet censorship treaty) and NDAA (indefinite military detention of American citizens without due process bill). Yet it came as no surprise when in mid-January Congressman Paul introduced an amendment to repeal the NDAA's most undemocratic section. In the space of one semester, he had become our champion. Our favorite Frank Capra classic, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" had a happy ending, but it was only a film. Will Ron Paul garner enough support to disappoint the Republican establishment's predetermined nominee despite systematic media misrepresentation? Will the good doctor be given a chance to cure our woes come November? In my opinion, given the pro-war, pro-bankster, anti-lib-erty direction adopted by both parties, our collective future as a free nation may depend on it. As Ron Paul said in ""We've Been Neo-Conned"": ""Let it not be said that no one cared, that no one objected once it's realized that our liberties and wealth are in jeopardy."" The author is an associate professor in the Italian department and an instructor for Literature Humanities.After Office HoursEach Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won't find in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome.I reactivated my Facebook account to post Paul-related articles, switched my affiliation from independent to Republican to vote in the primaries, and began shopping at the campaign's on-line store."
562,STAFF EDITORIAL Make study abroad easier,10 February 2012,"Make study abroad easierColumbia prides itself on being a global university and increasingly expanding its presence overseas. With University President Lee Bollinger's recent announcements of plans to internationalize the Core and build more global centers, as well as Spectator's recent news story about higher numbers of students in different corners of the world (""More undergrads studying abroad in developing countries,"" Feb. 6), it is difficult to disagree. Yet students still have more incentive to stay at Columbia than to study abroad. The Office of Global Programs states that students need to have completed most of the Core, particularly Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and two years of a foreign language requirement. Students need to have at least a 3.0 GPA both overall and in the foreign language they are studying, which prevents many students from applying. Moreover, universities affiliated with the study abroad program tend to give fewer academic credits than Columbia does for the same number of classes. With the Core, their majors, and overall academic requirements to consider, students might decide against study abroad in order to ensure that they complete their studies by their eighth semester and graduate with their class. It doesn't help that interested students have to pay Columbia tuition at whatever institution they would consider when abroad—even when a semester at a foreign universitycan cost half as much. Lastly, there is the fact that many students came to Columbia to be in New York in the first place. New York is a global city, and the benefits of an urban metropolis with so many cultural, artistic, and touristic offerings can be enough for some. The recently announced fifth-year study abroad program, though a novel idea, doesn't cater well to undergraduates. Most students forgo study abroad because they want to graduate in time, and spending an extra year to study abroad doesn't sound enticing. There are several potential solutions to solve some of these dilemmas, one of which is to provide the Core Curriculum abroad so that students would have less pressure to finish their requirements before leaving for a semester (""Core Curriculum may have hit the road with study abroad students,"" Dec. 9). In this way, students would have a unique experience in an entirely different culture and part of the globe while still receiving the education they came to get at Columbia Despite the impediments, Columbia's study abroad program has taken steps forward. School of Engineering and Applied Science students are now exempt from having to complete two years of a foreign language. New global centers in different countries also allow students to tap into more alumni networks. Columbia still has a way to go, though, to make studying abroad less difficult for students. We hope Columbia can make requirements for the programs more flexible, or allow students to complete them abroad. We believe the Office of Global Programs would do well to work with foreign universities to implement these changes. In good time, these resources can lead students to the path of global citizenship."
563,30 YEARS LATER,16 February 2012,"Interviews by Monica Cartythe class of 1987 reflects on coeducation at Columbia,Meredith Foster, and RikkiNovetskyThe class of 1987 reflects on coeducation at ColumbiaInterviews by Monica Carty,Meredith Foster, and Rikki NovetskyPhotos courtesy of Sandy Asirvantham, Geoffrey Miller, Teresa Saputo-Crerend, and Catherine WebsterAfter 229 years as an all-male institution, Columbia College became the last Ivy to begin accepting women. This month marks the 30-year anniversary of the decision to make Columbia coed, and it seems impossible to imagine a Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization class without a female perspective. Yet 30 years wasn't that long ago, and the alumni of the class of 1987 still have fresh memories of what it was like to be the first ones to set foot on a coed Columbia campus—memories of urinals in female bathrooms, professors who had never taught a female student, and frat boys who walked around in T-shirts championing Columbia College as 100 percent male. In this week's lead, four womenand one man reflect on their experiences as part of the first coed class and answer questions about discrimination, New York City, relations with Barnard, and the effect of the AIDS epidemic on the dating scene.How were the relationships between Barnard and Columbia women? Sibling rivalry is a natural consequence of the whole situation. 1 think for me personally and for all of us to some degree. I had some excellent role models who were upperclass women at Barnard. There was more anxiety between the women who had gone to Barnard as first-year students and those who had gone to Columbia as first-year students. We also—this probably doesn't happen to you very much—had to correct people all the time. ""Where do you go to school?"" ""Columbia"" ""Oh, Barnard?"" Barnard is a nice school that Ido not attend. I didn't apply there. It's a great school—l have a lot of respect for it. I don't go there. It was very hard for people to understand that I could be a student at Columbia College. Just in general or within the Columbia community? If they knew about Columbia and Barnard, they would just assume that I was a Barnard student. Which wasn't the worst fate ever, but still, it was wrong. People would ask, ""How come Columbia"
564,Where to draw the Lin?,2 March 2012,"Jeremy Lin is a handful in the sack. I have this on good authority front Dr. Ruth Westheimer. At least, that's what she implies in her recent article in the Daily Beast, 'What Jeremy Lin, Basketball Teach Us About Sex."" Before you get up in arms, let me point out that the bedroom is just one of the arenas Lin apparently excels in. Last week, GQ magazine ran a piece about the overnight basketball sensation titled ""What the GOP Can Learn From Jeremy Lin"" and Forbes magazine published ""4Lessons Your Business Can Learn from Jeremy Linfsanity)."" On the face of it, articles like these are completely ridiculous. When given a closer look, though... Nope, still ridiculous. Do we really need to drag celebrities and pop culture icons into spheres where they don't belong? When Lin scored 38 points to beat the Lakers, I'm pretty sure he wasn't thinking about the Republican Party. He was focused on winning the game. Massive endorsement deals might have also crossed his mind. And do we really need Jeremy Lin to teach us that sharing and working hard are recipes for success? No, that's why we have Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer. What this really amounts to is an issue of over-extrapola-tion This should be familiar to anyone who's taken Literature Humanities. Sure, it's possible the Iliad is a metaphor for Power Rangers: Zeus embodies Megazord, Achilles represents the Red Ranger, the Trojan War symbolizes 1990s children programming, etc. Argue the points until you're blue in the face, but at best I'm going to roll my eyes at you. At worst, I'll give you the Heimlich. Perhaps the blame lies in close reading, an analytical mode drilled into us from middle school onwards. Zoom in too close, and you lose sight of the big picture. Dig too deep, and you find things that aren't there. Scratch too hard, and you get sent to the principal's office. Laziness might be part of the problem, too. If you watched the Knicks instead of reading the Romantics, you might as well incorporate it into the class discussion. And your term paper on Jack Kerouac. You know what, throw basketballs into your senior thesis while you're at it You can call it, ""Keats, the Beats, and Jeremy Lin."" Maybe we're just bored. Picture it: You're in class at 7:40 p.m. The windows are bolted shut, and the thermostat's stuck at 30 degrees Celsius (whatever that is). The guy on your right has 8.0. that's pungent enough to trigger your allergies. Suddenly, Kim Kardashian begins to seem extremely relevant to Machiavelli's ""The Prince."" To be fair, skepticism cuts both ways. Jeremy Lin's example demonstrates that even the experts don't know diamonds from drek. By relying too heavily on our expectations, we risk missing out on something truly great In fact, many of the most important innovations today bring together ideas that once seemed remote. Baby Einstein comes to mind. As in the case of depressed, superstitious people, the solution is probably to find a happy medium. We should open ourselves to new possibilities, even as we keep a lookout for the attractively fallacious and familiar. Otherwise, we'll quickly find ourselves confusing media sensations for founts of wisdom. This is not to disparage Lin. His triumph in the NBA is inspirational. I can't help feeling that if Jeremy Lin beats the odds, maybe Jeremy Liss can, too. Who knows? In a couple of .years, ""Lissanity,"" ""Lissterine,"" and ""Lissentious"" may be all the rage.

565,The core of Global Core,7 March 2012,"To consider the role of nonWestern scholarship and thought in the Core Curriculum, it is necessary to reemphasize why the Core exists in the first place. From a historical perspective, the Core came about in response to World War I, with the goal of educating the country's youth in a way that would help prevent war in the future. This initial catalyst began to form what would eventually become a full curriculum that gives its students a complete understanding of the origins and history of the West. Through the study of literature, philosophy, music, and art, the creators of the Core thought that students graduating from Columbia would fundamentally understand their society and civilization. The Core Curriculum has expanded beyond its original intentions. For a campus that often lacks community, the courses that we all take in common are building blocks of a common Columbia identity among undergraduates. As ivory-tower as it sounds, our common exposure to the ""Iliad"" creates an interconnectedness that we would not have otherwise. The lack of a disciplinary focus in these Core classes also has come to define their appeal. As any Columbia College student knows, classes like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization do not approach the course material with a particular departmental lens. Whether a biology or philosophy major, a student can feel free to engage with texts from his or her point of view and background. Because of the accessibility of these courses, they have much more to give to the students who take them. The final added benefit to the Core Curriculum system is that degree to which knowledge is prescribed for the students. By having such a rigid set of classes that span such a large period of time, the College can ensure that each of its students has been exposed to what experienced educators and academicians have agTeed is important. If they are to be believed, then the Core Curriculum gives every student the necessary groundwork to understand the world. The Global Core, in its effort to represent theimportant role of non-Western civilizations, lacks all three of these benefits. As it stands now, there is a list of about 100 courses from which students choose two to fulfill the requirement The courses are almost all in specific departments. Because of this disparity, there is no wide body of knowledge to which all students are exposed. Instead, the Global Core serves only to force students to take a course that is not particularly related to Western civilization. While that is a good goal, and we are all better educated because of it, the non-Western aspect of the Core could be much more robust The solution, I believe, is in establishing the Global Core as a single, year-long class for all students. While similar to Lit Hum and CC in format, it would combine literature and philosophy and span a much greater geography. Its goal would be analogous to the Core itself: to expose students to just enough foundational knowledge to be able to understand the world and potentially build upon it in their personal educational pursuits. Additionally, it would build Columbia's community through common education and introduce students to non-Western concepts without the limitations of a department or discipline guiding the discussion. Condensing the Global Core into a single course will certainly draw some immediate criticism. Part of the reason it remains such a wide-ranging requirement is that the non-Western parts of the world are numerous and impossible to distill. To limit the requirement to one specific course would rob students of the Global Core's topical specificity. However, such an argument is tenuous, given that it could also apply to existing Core classes. Is a semester of Art Humanities really enough to get a sense of thousands of years of art? Is a year of Lit Hum even enough to do all of Western literature justice? The point has never been to be comprehensiveit has been to give a taste. Then, if students were intrigued, they could spend some of their academic time studying those subjects. The current Global Core makes the mistake of choosing to be comprehensive in one small area instead of being broad in its exposure. While the battle for a required non-Western curriculum would be bitter, its resolution would place yet another jewel in the crown of a Columbia education.

566,Internal CC dean search announced,29 March 2012,"BY MARGARET MATTES Spectator Senior Staff WriterTwo students will serve on the search committee for a permanent dean of Columbia College, to be selected from a pool of internal candidates, University President Lee Bollinger announced on Wednesday. The committee is expected to submit its recommendation by the end of the year. In an email, Bollinger said that the search committee will be accepting nominations between now and April 15, andwill then conduct interviews with a select number of candidates. He said that he hopes that by the end of this academic year he will be able to make the selection with Provost John Coatsworth and Executive Vice President Nicholas Dirks based on the recommendation of the committee. Chemistry professor James Valentini was appointed interim dean after Michele MoodyAdams resigned in August, and has been a much more visible figure among students than his predecessor, hosting officehours, attending campus events, and offering a Milano Market sandwich to the winner of a Bwog contest to come up with a nickname for himself. (A plaque of ""Deantini,"" the winning entry, sits on his desk.) Valentini is widely perceived to be a frontrunner for the job. In an interview last week, he said that he would accept the position as permanent dean if offered. ""Dean Valentini has done a wonderful job and so he wouldmake a terrific candidate,"" Coatsworth said in an interview. ""We would look for somebody who would be a superb administrator and who understands and embraces the educational goals of the College. We would look for somebody who would work well with students and alumni and the rest of the University.""Eight faculty members, two alumni, and two students—J.T. Ramseur and Mary Kircher, both CC 'l3—will serve on the committee. Although the committee has not yet convened, Ramseur said he was excited that the administration was ""trying to have student representation."" ""I'm going to try keep in mind all of the concerns I hear from my fellow CC students,"" he said. The search process differs markedly from the last search for a dean of the college. The committee that selected Moody-Adams, who came from Cornell, spent nine months looking for candidates both from Columbia andoutside, whereas this committee will spend a month, making its selection only from internal candidates. ""The president has in mind that this is a complicated and important job and so experience at Columbia would be a real asset to anyone who was considered,"" Coatsworth said. Besides Ramseur and Kircher, the committee members include Ruth DeFries, professor of sustainable development and environmental science; Tom DiPrete, professor of sociology; Stuart Firestein,chair of the biology department; Christia Mercer, chair of Literature Humanities; Bob O'Meally, professor of English and director of the Center for Jazz Studies; Cathy Popkin, professor of Slavic languages; Kyra Barry, CC 'B7 and president of the Columbia College Alumni Association; and Yale Fergang, CC 'B7 and SEAS 'BB. It will also include two other faculty members, from whom Bollinger said he is still awaiting confirmation. margaret. mattes @columbiaspectator.com""This is a complicated and important job and so experience at Columbia would be a real asset."" —John Coatsworth, provostSEARCH HIGH AND LOW I Columbia College Interim Dean James Valentini said he would accept if offered the job permanendy."
567,"Profs, students hold 'Keys to the Core' panel discussion",2 April 2012,"BY AVANTIKA KUMAR Spectator Staff WriterProfessors, students, and alumni gathered on Friday to discuss the history of the Core Curriculum and the challenges facing it today, including the lack of dedicated faculty willing to teach it. East Asian studies professor William Theodore de Bary moderated a ""Keys to the Core"" panel that included three professors and three students. The professors—Michael Rosenthal, Douglas Chalmers, and Peter Pouncey— stressed the importance of the Core as a means to familiarize all students with canonical works of literature. Former Columbia College dean Austin Quigley, an English professor, said during the discussion that maintaining the Core's strength is in the bestinterests of administrators as well as of students and faculty. ""It is wonderful that there's a long tradition of faculty, students, and alumni discussing the Core,"" Quigley said. ""It is very important that, to Columbia, that the Core continue to flourish."" Rosenthal, a Literature Humanities professor, served as Columbia College's associate dean of students from 1972 to 1989. He said that, given the University's ""historically indifferent"" attitude to undergraduate concerns, the development of the Core was ""miraculous."" ""It's quite remarkable and wonderful that this curriculum developed,"" Rosenthal said. But while panelists and attendees emphasized the importance of the Core Curriculum,they also discussed the challenges to maintaining it. Given that there are currently about 60 sections each of Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization every semester, Rosenthal said, finding qualified and committed faculty to teach the Core continues to be a struggle. He added that before the Columbia College faculty was essentially folded into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, there existed a stronger sense of ""divisional loyalty."" ""There was general concern for undergraduates within the college faculty,"" Rosenthal told Spectator. ""People were more willing to teach outside of their narrow specialization years ago."" Rosenthal noted that there was a ""sea change"" among faculty—an increasing emphasis upon research output rather than teaching quality. ""The University rewards people who make significant contributions in their scholarship,"" Rosenthal said, adding during the panel discussion that despite platitudes that are thrown around about the Core, there are ""senior faculty that wouldn't touch it."" Rosenthal suggested that the University could include willingness and ability to teach in the Core as a factor in hiring and tenure decisions. Chalmers also said that monetary incentives such as the Chamberlain Fellowship, which gives graduate students a funded year to pursue research after they teach in the Core for threeyears, can help draw instructors to the core. ""After they've done it for a few years, they really like it,"" Chalmers said, adding that, for faculty, ""the Core is really an enormous commitment."" Chalmers and de Bary said that, for many Core faculty, the process of teaching the Core is a rewarding learning experience in itself. De Bary said that faculty often ""only became educated themselves in the process of teaching the Core."" Student Governing Board chair David Fine, CC 'l3, sat on the panel alongside Spectator editorial page editor Lanbo Zhang, CC 'l4, and Spectator columnist Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, CC 'l4. Fine spoke about the importance of understanding the intellectual issues that Core classes engage, but he also expressed concern that not enough money is being devoted to the Core. During a question-and-answer session, Samuel Roth, CC 'l2 and a former Spectator editor-in-chief, questioned the dedication of the faculty as a whole to the Core, saying that there needs to be a ""cultural shift in the faculty."" Still, the students, faculty, and alumni at the event agreed that, however difficult the Core is to maintain, it is crucial to Columbia College's identity. ""The Core is the college's intellectual signature and has been for generations and will continue into the foreseeable future,"" Quigley said. avantika.kumar @columbiaspectator.comGETTING AT THE CORE I Three students and three longtime professors formed a panel that discussed the Core on Friday."
568,"Profs Lurie, Mercer honored by students",3 April 2012,"BY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterTwo professors were recognized with two of the University's highest student-awarded teaching prizes on Monday. Christia Mercer, a philosophy professor and the chair of Literature Humanities, received the 51st annual Mark Van Doren Award, which awards a professor for his or her ""commitment to undergraduate instruction, as well as for humanity, devotion to truth and inspiring leadership."" Mercer has been a favorite of Columbia College students since becoming Lit Hum chair in 2010, professing her love for Orlando Bloom's abs in the film ""Troy,"" and appearing as herself in a series of Bwog videos. She spearheaded an effort to overhaul the Core Curriculum website, providing students with interdisciplinary resources to supplement classroom lessons. The award is named for Mark Van Doren, Ph.D. '2O, who won a Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1940 and taught English at Columbia. David Lurie, Ph.D. 'Ol and an associate professor of Japanese history and literature, was awarded the 37th annual Lionel Trilling Award for his book, ""Realms of Literacy: Early Japan and the History of Writing."" The book studies a millennium of Japanese oral and textual tradition. The award is named for Lionel Trilling, CC '25, M.A. '26, who was an eminent literary critic and also taught at Columbia, and recognizes a faculty member whose book was published in the past year. The Columbia College Academic Awards Committee, which selects the recipients, is made up of 10 Columbia College students. They audit the classes of the nominees for the Van Doren award during the judging process and read the books of the nominees for the Trilling Award. jeremy.budd @columbiaspectator.com"
569,FROM THE EDITOR:,11 April 2012,"Since its creation in 1919, the Core Curriculum has revolved around literature and philosophy. To this day, Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities remain its pride and joy. Yet since the end of World War I, the world has changed in a way that the Core has not. Academia has fundamentally evolved. Not one major American research university functions without robust departments in the natural sciences. In such a radically different world, the Core's response is the science requirement Lanbo Zhang Editorial Page Editor"
570,A scientific Core,11 April 2012,"From its inception, the Core Curriculum has been defined by universal requirements of particular classes. This has always been at odds with the more popular system of giving students general distribution requirements. By requiring students to dabble in particular disciplines,these schools fall short of giving students a comprehensive foundation of understanding. Instead, distribution requirements are specialized to the whims of students, not directed toward the ideas and texts that have had an impact on our society. The current science requirement is merely a general distribution requirement, propped up with a required course—Frontiers of Science—that is almost universally disliked. The open-endedness of the science requirement and the ability for students to select from a large list of courses is understandable. The sciences differ from the humanities because of their linearity. A student can come to Columbia and be knowledgeable enough about biology that an introductory course would actually teach him nothing. On the other hand, an expert student of literature can come into Literature Humanities and gain just as much as the unread student. This is largely a function of the discursive nature of the course and its lack of a particular discipline. Professors of theCore constantly remark that they themselves learn more each year by teaching the Core. This does not hold in the context of the sciences, since there is a particular developmental path in the discipline. However, this does not give us a free pass to leave the science portion of the Core as something resembling distribution requirements. Instead, the wider aims of the Core must be incorporated as much as possible. Take, for example, the goal of giving every student the vocabulary to serve the public good to the greatest extent This takes the form of philosophical literacy in Contemporary Civilization, but what about other types of literacy that are important for understanding the world? As a senior, it is clear to me that knowing the basics of computer science will be critical to understanding the innovation of the coming century. I did not realize that as a first-year, which meant that I never exposed myself to the discipline. In the same way that professors decide for us that it is important to read the ""Iliad"" and the ""Confessions,"" perhaps it should be decided for future underclassmen that it is important to have at least an introduction to computer science. This mentality also holds for mathematics and lab sciences. The logic involved in math and the scientific rigor required of a lab science help us understand the world in ways that the humanities cannot convey. Students should not be able to graduate from Columbia ignorant of the basics of computer science, the logic of math, and the rigor of scientific experimentation. While there would have to be flexibility for students who already have advancedunderstandings of these concepts, this stricter requirement would bring the spirit of the Core into the sciences. As of this moment, it is up to students to seek this out for themselves, resisting the temptation of Oceanography or Physics for Poets and putting extra work on their plates. Not surprisingly, it is rare to see a student do that. I myself took an introductory psychology course partially because I did not want to be inconvenienced. The Core exists in spite of (or even to spite) students' laziness and ignorance. We are forced to take classes that we otherwise would never take. As a result, we gain understandings of the world that would have been lost otherwise. After four years here, it is important for every student to have an understanding of computer science, math, and scientific experimentation. I write this as a student who only experienced one of those three and feels less prepared to fully understand the world than I could have been. While it may be a large burden to put on students, it is no less important than the other specific burdens placed on us through the Core. Like most of us do now as we look back on Lit Hum, I'm confident that students who go through this iteration of the science requirement will acknowledge the value of the burden as they leave Columbia and apply their minds to our society's challenges.

571,First-years to take required academic honesty workshop,12 April 2012,"BY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterAdministrators will place a greater emphasis on academic integrity next fall, requiring first-year students to take a workshop that will lay out plagiarism guidelines and offer advice to succeeding academically. Groups of about 30 students will meet with Hazel May, associate dean of academic affairs, and Jeri Henry, senior assistant dean of judicial affairs and community standards, to discuss academic integrity, the transition from high school to college, and the services that advisers and librarians are able to offer students. May said that the setup of the Core Curriculum in part sparked the move to ensure students maintain academic integrity. With as many as 60 sections of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, many students take the same course yet feel that academic integrity policies are not communicated in the same way across sections. Beyond questions about plagiarism and citation, the workshops will also focus on how college is different from high school, May said. ""We're conceiving it at this point as a broader workshop to enable students to understand the opportunities and responsibilities as a college student at large."" She recently generated a guide for students about academic honesty that is now available on the Columbia College website. ""That's really what we want to be the focus—academicintegrity,"" Henry said. ""It's going to be a collaborative effort and we're seeing ways that we can help students fill in the gaps and create this educational opportunity."" The administrators said the creation of the workshops was not in response to any particular incident, but part of a lon-ger-term effort by the Office of Academic Affairs to help students produce their best work. ""That's been a constant thread for us,"" she said. ""We want to set up our students for success."" Six Columbia College Student Council members, led by Vice President for Policy Ryan Cho, CC 'l3, and Academic Affairs Representative Bruno Mendes, CC 'l4 and a Spectator finance deputy, are studying academic integrity policies at peer schools to determine how to mitigate cheating at Columbia. They are working independent of the Office of Academic Affairs. Columbia College does not release the number of reported incidents of academic dishonesty, though in March 2011 Literature Humanities Chair Christia Mercer emailed firstyears that several students had been caught cheating on a Lit Hum midterm. At the time, Mercer said she was working with then-Columbia College Dean Michele Moody-Adams to formulate a clearer policy for defining academic dishonesty to students. Kathryn Yatrakis, dean of academic affairs, said that it is possible for students to beconfused about policies that may differ between professors, citing the possibility of collaboration between students as a nebulous example. ""I think it helps both on the student and faculty side so we're all on the same page,"" Henry said. ""We can initiate those conversations across the board."" High school senior Courtland Thomas, who was accepted to Columbia College in March, said that, while he was hesitant about making the workshops mandatory, he thought they were an excellent idea. Because different teachers' academic policies vary, he said, ""I try to stay strictly with the teacher because I want to know what they expect.""While the workshops will be offered to only Columbia College students in the fall, Yatrakis said she hopes to see similar seminars in the Schools of Engineering and Applied Science and General Studies. ""There will be close collaboration with other colleagues, especially within the Center for Student Advising,"" Yatrakis said. ""It would be wonderful if we could arm our advisers with the information that we will be giving students."" ""If the ultimate goal is to equip our students with the resources and understanding of how to find resources to do their best work, then we want to be sure that this is our best work,"" May said. ""It is absolutely crucial that this is our best work."" jeremy.budd @columbiaspectator.com"
572,THE BLACK BOX,12 April 2012,"by Michele Cleary and Samuel E. RothWhat's happening inside Low Library?cover illustration by Eric WohlstadterWHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE LOW LIBRARY?BY MICHELE CLEARY AND SAMUEL E. ROTHILLUSTRATIONS BY ERIC WOHLSTADTERNobody wants to talk about Michele MoodyAdams. ""What exactly the inside story is there, we're never going to know. I think that's so old by now, and it's almost irrelevant,"" Christia Mercer, chair of Literature Humanities, says of the former dean's abrupt resignation. ""What's relevant is that we get it right going ahead."" MoodyAdams' departure last August, coming on the heels of Claude Steele's resignation as University provost over the summer, fixed a spotlight on the problems facing both Columbia College and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The incident raised questions about the transparency of the senior administration, the place of the college within the University, and the role of the faculty in high-level decision making. But mostof all, it seemed to resonate with a set of deeper concerns: If the dean felt powerless, then who holds the reins of power at Columbia? How do the many distinct voices and interests of a diverse institution come together to decide policy? How are the limited resources of a prestigious university distributed, and in whose office is the pie divided? ""It's hard not to see the problems,"" says James Shapiro, Larry Miller Professor of English and Comparative Literature. ""And it's even harder to see solutions."" Ultimately, the story of Arts and Sciences, Columbia College, and the larger University begins well before Moody-Adams' arrival on campus and remains unfinished to this day. Piecing it all together means understanding the fluid relationship between administrators, faculty, and businessmen; examining a previously unpublished report from McKinsey & Company; and analyzing a brand new structure for Arts and Sciences that may change everything. The McKinsey Report In 2009, Michele Moody-Adams was the first woman and the first African-American to be appointed dean of Columbia College. Formerly the vice provost for undergraduate education at Cornell, she was the first dean of the college to come from outside the University in over 30 years. Her tenure came to an unexpected end last August when she announced her plans to resign in an email she sent to a small group of alumni. In this email, she said she would be resigning in June 2012 because of concerns that upcoming changes to the administrative structure of Arts and Sciences would ""have the effect of diminishing and in some important instances eliminating the authority of the Dean of the College over crucial policy, fund-raising and budgetary matters."" The private email was leaked to both Spectator and Bwog and was soon followed by a message from University President Lee Bollinger announcing Moody-Adams' immediate departure. (Moody-Adams did not respond to a request for an interview.) Three days after Moody-Adams' resignation letter was leaked, Spectator published reports that her decision stemmed from behind-the-scenes tensions concerning a study, conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, that suggested ways to streamline the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. (The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is an administrative structure that includes five constituent schoolsColumbia College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Continuing Education, the School of the Arts, and General Studies—and the 29 academic departments associated with them.) The contents of the report, which has never been formally released, quickly became the subject of widespread speculation. A summary of the document, obtained for this story, sheds some light on the specific proposals that may have prompted Moody-Adams' concerns. The summary outlines three potential new structures for the Arts and Sciences, corresponding to low, moderate, and high degrees of reorganization. ""Type 1"" maintains the existing structure but adds a chief of staff for the executive vice president and establishes an ""Operating Committee"" for the Arts and Sciences to decide ""cross-cutting A&S issues (e.g., financial aid and admissions policies)."" The members of the Operating Committee are notspecified, but the report suggests that it include , school deans or new divisional deans for the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. ""Type 2"" relies more heavily on the proposed divisional deans. It calls for a chief of staff but also suggests the creation of ""functional heads,"" such as a chief financial officer or a head of human resources, who would set policy across the Arts and Sciences. The summary acknowledges that convincing the constituent schools to turn over authority to the functional heads ""likely requires Central University mandate."" The most extensive proposal, ""Type 3,"" integrates the leadership of Arts and Sciences into the central University. It suggests establishing the provost, or a leader directly under his aegis, as the key administrator for the arts and sciences. In this centralized setup, the individual deans and department chairs would directly report to one powerful overseer. All three strategies seek to narrow the responsibilities of the individual schools' deans. The summary explains that ""school deans [will] have approval rights over matters that require local attention,"" such as residential life, study abroad, student activities, and the ""care and feeding"" of undergraduates. In contrast, control of key areas—including the hiring of new faculty, creation of new programs, fundraising goals, and faculty salaries—would be transferred to divisional deans or the executive vicepresident for Arts and Sciences. None of the proposed restructuring plans presented to Moody-Adams actually came into effect, if they had, few matters of broad academic or financial significance would have been in the hands of the dean, lending credibility to Moody-Adams' concerns. A reorganization of Arts and Sciences is under way—but first, some history. Low as a Black Box Shapiro, who graduated from the college in 1977, has taught at Columbia for nearly 30 years. His office, 606b Philosophy Hall, has a beautiful view of Low Library, but he says he has little idea of what goes on inside. ""It's not that I haven't been here long enough or that my cars aren't open or I'm not curious about how things work,"" he says. Faculty members say they are often left out of the decisionmaking process until very late in the game, if they are brought in at all. Robert Jervis, Adlai E. Stevenson professor in the political science department, characterizes Low as ""a black box."" The deep uncertainties around the workings of"
573,8 professors win Guggenheim Fellowships,16 April 2012,"BY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterColumbia University received more Guggenheim Fellowships than any other institution this year, with eight professors earning grants that will allow them to take up to a year off for research. Literature Humanities chair Christia Mercer and Contemporary Civilization chair Matthew Jones were among the professors to win the prestigious fellowships. Both will be replaced by interim chairs next year. Almost 3,000 academics, artists, and scientists from the U.S. and Canada applied for the fellowships this year, and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation announced 181 winners on Friday. The other Columbia winners were School of the Arts professors Timothy Donnelly and Benjamin Taylor, Mailman School of Public Health professor Jennifer Hirsch, music professors Alex Mincek and Kate Soper, and Journalism School professor Stephen Hall. ""It's funny—l had already asked for a leave before I knew how I was going to afford it,"" Mercer said. ""It's very exciting for me."" The size of the grants varies based on each winner's project. Mercer will use her grant to research and write a book, to be titled ""Platonisms in Early Modern Thought,""and to oversee the writing of a new book series, ""Oxford Philosophical Concepts,"" for which she will travel to the American Academy in Rome next spring. Mercer will spend the fall semester at the National Humanities Center just south of Durham, N.C. She said that she enjoys teaching and chairing Lit Hum, but that those roles consume a lot of time that could be devoted to research.""It's very exciting to do all those things, but it's difficult to get research done,"" she said. ""It's nice to get an award like that, but what I'm most looking forward to is to have a year off to do my research and be involved with various projects."" Mercer said that classics professor Gareth Williams will serve as interim Lit Hum chair in her absence. Williams previously chaired the course in 2005-06 and from 2007-10.Jones said that classics professor James Zetzel, who chaired CC from 1999-2002, will be the interim CC chair. Jones—who has researched and taught classes about the history of science—will use his fellowship to study the history of data mining, a technique for summarizing large sets of data via computer software. ""For the first time in my career, I'm going to be writing a history of people who aren't dead,"" he said. ""This is a pretty substantial shift in my own interests, and these grants are going to get me the space really to undertake some new training."" Jones said he is looking forward to building a foundation in these technical disciplines and interviewing some of the ""key practitioners"" of data mining. ""These grants want you to pursue a sort of new track in your research, so this will enable me to do that over the next few years,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to being able to learn these technical disciplines at the foundational levels and hopefully interview many of the key practitioners."" Jones added that he will remain involved next year in the Committee on the Core and in an effort to endow the Core Curriculum. Hirsch will use her fellowship to pursue research on the ""connections between married women's HIV risk in rural""Certainly the financial assistances are tremendous and will be life-altering for me."" —Timothy Donnelly, School of the Arts professorMexico and the organization of production and consumption in the United States,"" according to the foundation's website. ""The title of the book is 'Desire Across Borders,' and it will use the case of the intersection between U.S.-Mexico migration and HIV to make a broader argument about the multi-level determinants of health inequalities,"" Hirsch said in an interview. ""It starts out looking at intimacy and the reasons that Mexican married couples may not want to use condoms when men return home to Mexico after long sojourns in the U.S."" Hirsch has a background in anthropology and population dynamics. She said that for this project, she hopes to use data she has collected over the last 15 years and to revisit Mexico. ""It's so easy in public health to say people should change their behavior, but if we want to change behavior, we should look at our own consumer behavior,"" she said. ""Another thing that's great is that I'm lucky enough to work in a department with colleagues who produce some of the best work in the world from my field (the intersection of social science and public health), so I'm looking forward to getting feedback from them as the work develops."" Donnelly won a Guggenheim Fellowship for poetry. He plans to use the funds to finish a poetry book tentatively titled ""The Problem of Many."" ""As much as I love my job and teaching, it's difficult to undertake the writing of a book,"" hesaid. ""You just have to blinder yourself to everything but the task at hand."" Donnelly also won the $lOO,OOO Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award earlier this year for his book ""The Cloud Corporation."" He wrote most of the poems for that book on the living room floor of the rented apartment where he lives with his wife and two young daughters, and he said that he's looking forward to using some of hisfellowship money to rent an artist's studio in Red Hook, Brooklyn. ""To have been chosen is just unbelievable ... It's been a very good year for me, but certainly the financial assistances are tremendous and will be life-alter-ing for me,"" he said.

574,"Sanders, Pulitzer in tow, recalls Spec life",19 April 2012,"BY NAOMI COHEN Spectator Staff WriterEli Sanders, CC '99, doesn't remember much of Kenneth Jackson's History of the City of New York class. ""I took a really good nap in the back aisle—but I had a really good time on the bike tour,"" Sanders, winner of the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing, said via phone on Wednesday. He also doesn't remember his Literature Humanities teacher's name—though he loved the class, as it ""forced you to read great stories""—but he does remember the unmentionable things he did in the Spectator office's dark room as editor in chief in 1998. Spectator ""ate my life in college, but it was really fucking fun,"" he said. ""Every day you'd show up after class, have dinner and arguments and little triumphs, hopefully maybe a lot of laughs, but usually too few, with a bunch of people who you love and hate and can't stand and at some point can't believe you're not with anymore."" But Sanders said it's funny how little has changed. A Seattle native, he interned at the Seattle Times directly after graduating from Columbia, and after a three-year residency took up bike messengering. That's still among his favorite jobs, along with being a delivery boy of ""a pint of Ben & Jerry's and a movie and condoms"" for the dot-com business Kozmo. ""I knocked on some weird doors answered by some weird people,"" Sanders said. In the end, he stuck with journalism, where he still has fun. ""Part of what I like about journalism is getting to enter all these corners of the world that you don't get to enter otherwise."" After dabbling with the Boston Globe, the New York Times, and Esquire, among others, Sanders settled with Seattle's The Stranger—a ""scrappylittle alt-weekly,"" as he called it—whose slogan is ""Seattle's Only Newspaper"" and whose editor is a sex columnist. The morning of the Pulitzer Prize announcement, Sanders said he assumed he hadn't won since he hadn't received a notification before the results were published. Only after checking the website, showing the page to his editor, and calling someone else to confirm did his win register.Spectator friends sent him text messages and emails of congratulations upon hearing the announcement. One friend reposted a picture of Sanders—as he writes on his website, ""many haircuts ago""—posing with ""60 Minutes"" journalist Andy Rooney at a Spectator dinner. ""I love that,"" he said. The Stranger is the fifth alternative weekly to win a Pulitzer. The jury called Sanders' article, ""The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"" ""a haunting story of a woman who survived a brutal attack that took the life of her partner."" The day after the hoard awarded Sanders the prize, The Stranger wrote that the reaction to the award by the subject of the article was more meaningful than the award itself. Jennifer Hopper, who remained anonymous until after the piece was published, congratulated him in the office the day of the announcement; sayingthat she pictured her deceased partner celebrating. ""The reporter-subject relationship is always an unconventional one,"" Sanders said. He met her for coffee after the crime in 2009, but since she couldn't speak to any media during the trial, he said he grew acquainted with her through her testimony. ""It was a story that cried out to be written. I didn't want to let go—l couldn't let go."" The heavy material in the case and local nature of the paper forced Sanders and his editor to define what should and should not be said in the piece, a process which Sanders found challenging. Though many comments on his article came from locals who knew those involved, the feature speaks to a wider audience. Sanders said that while some may have followed the case and forgotten about it, ""The Bravest Woman"" extracts themes that ""can be telling, almost universal issues to explore."" ""The simple fact of her courage ... was incredible to watch. Violence, sexual assault, faults in the criminal justice and mental health systems—none of that is unique to Seattle or to the local community,"" he said.

575,Feminist theorist Judith Butler rethinks kinship,19 April 2012,"BY LESLEY THULIN Spectator Senior Staff WriterThe humanities were given a vote of confidence from an intellectual superstar on Wednesday, in a lecture by renowned feminist and queer theorist Judith Butler. Butler delivered ""Reflections on Kinship Trouble,"" the third installment of the Barnard Humanities Initiative in Barnard Hall. Buder's influential book, ""Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity,"" changed the course of gender and sexuality studies by famously putting forth the theory that gender and sexuality are performative, when it was first published in 1990. In the lecture, Butler explored kinship as a source of confusion. ""People are periodically confused about kinship,"" Butler said atthebeginningofher lecture. Kin relations are both recognizable and ""nearly unrecognizable."" ""Children do ask, 'Are you my mother?' and a fair amount of children's fiction is oriented around the question whether or not a given animal, for instance, is or is not someone's mother ... or which one is the real mother?"" The author of 2000's ""Antigone's Claim: Kinship Between Life and Death,"" Butler focused her discussion on Greek tragedy—specifically, Euripides' ""The Bacchae"" and ""Antigone,"" and Sophocles' ""Oedipus the King."" But she also brought her discussion outside of the realm of theoiy into, a modern context. Butler cited an amicus brief she wrote—which argued that the Chilean Supreme Court's decision to deny Karen Atala, a lesbian mother, custody of her children violated her human rights—to illustrate how modern kinship categories do or do not attach to people. ""In arguing for her parental rights her lawyers had to discredit the notion that she was damaging her children and their development by virtue of being 'out' as a lesbian and a mother,"" Butler said. ""If one returns to 'The Bacchae' with this case in mind, one might wonder how we rethink the figure of Agaue ... Does the play give us insight into the murderous aggression of mothers—of the murderous consequences of their sexual ventures or sexual dispositions?"" Using these classical examples as a foil for a greater discussion of sexuality and gender, Butler discussed the impact of a parent's sexuality on a child—or the lack thereof. ""A young adolescent girl says to her two dads, ""Will you be disappointed in me if I'm not gay?' And they respond, 'Listen, if you're gay, you'll be like us. If you like men, you'll be like us. So in either case, you won't escape us.' It's a strangely narcissistic response ... meant to operate in the service of permission."" But for Butler, it returns us to ""the problem of those breaks in kinship that seem to be part of its very definition and those forms of misrecognition that seem to characterize the life of kin relations."" The lecture related to Lit Hum texts in two ways, accordingto Christia Mercer, the chair of Literature Humanities, who was in the audience. ""All of them [the Lit Hum texts] involve, fundamentally, some discussion of family and family-rela-tions, so it's obviously relevant there,"" Mercer said. ""But also given that she talked about some of our Lit Hunt authors and some of our Lit Hum texts, it was a really rich analysis of part of Sophocles."" The lecture provoked Mercer's interest in a topic beyond the scope of Butler's discussion. ""One thing I was going to ask her is the question about the Christian notion of kinship, because that notion of kinship is universal—and that's a very Lit Hum question—as a counter to the ancient Greek stuff,"" Mercer said. Butler is a visiting professor of the humanities in the department of English and comparative literature. Butler is teaching a graduate course in the department called ""Reading Kafka."" arts@columbiaspectator.com"
576,FIFTH-YEAR STUDY ABROAD FELLOWS: WHERE ARE THEY GOING? Six seniors take fifth year to circle globe,20 April 2012,"Six seniors take fifth year to circle globeBY MELISSA VON MAYRHAUSER Spectator Senior Staff WriterSix seniors will spend a year after graduation studying abroad as part of the inaugural fifth-year fellows program, and the Core Curriculum might join them overseas. As the fifth-year fellows prepare to travel around the worldusing Columbia's eight global centers as hubs—several faculty committees are developing proposals to teach Core classes at the centers as well. ""We definitely want to use the global centers as base camps, but we also want to branch off,"" said Theo Di Castri, CC 'l2 and one of the fellows. ""The centers are ways to get connected to various institutions and people who might be able to help us out."" The other fifth-year fellows, all Columbia College seniors, are Daniel Alonso, Alexandra Cook, Layan Fuleihan, Zehra Hasmi, and Alejandro Jinich.Vice President for Global Centers Ken Prewitt said that the University has secured needbased financial aid for the fellows from donors. ""The business plan will evolve as we learn how well this program works,"" Prewitt said. ""It will certainly require resources of funding, and I would expect those to be donors who would be particularly attracted to a program as innovative as this one."" There are currently global centers located in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, and Santiago, and there are likely more on the horizon. Di Castri, who is studying neuroscience and comparative literature, and Hashmi, an anthropology major, will conduct a joint research project, traveling through at least eight countries. They plan to connect their sciences and humanities backgrounds, examining public spaces in cities through several binaries—local and global,LEGEND ;MM ALEXANDRA COOK ■■ ALEJANDRO JINICH COUNTRY WITH !

""We wanted to deconstruct binaries that emerged when thinking about globalization,"" Hashmi said. ""The whole [fifthyear] program itself wants to build off the Core Curriculum. We came up with this idea from the Core. What are the ideals within the Core of Rousseau or Locke? What was this modern idea of a society?"" ""We're going to go to Dubai and Singapore as two examples of places that have taken on this idea of modern Utopias and see what underlies that,"" he added. They will also explore the local-global divide by visiting Brazil, Switzerland and India, as well as their home countries—Canada for Di Castri and Pakistan for Hashmi. ""I think we both come from fairly inward-looking places,"" Di Castri said. ""Globalization always seemed like this thing that happens elsewhere. Eventhose places that are seemingly so very local are implicated in globalization."" Alonso and Fuleihan will also travel together. The six students will start with on-campus seminars in September, travel abroad between October and March, and come back to campus by April. Prewitt said that there were fewer applicants than he had hoped for. The program was open to students in CC, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of General Studies. Jinich plans to travel to eight Latin American countries, including Mexico and Brazil, to study the social climate in places where economic growth and social inequalities have developed simultaneously. He will conduct research by talking to individuals in the countries that he visits and immersing himself in thelocal cultures. ""The idea is spending at least three weeks in each place,"" Jinich said. ""I don't want to be jumping around and then lose opportunities for more profound engagement."" Victoria de Grazia, the interim director of the Paris global center, said it is important for the University to discuss whether to focus international education around visiting a wide variety of countries or immersion in just a few cultures. ""The important thing is not to do tourism and to dig in,"" de Grazia said. ""I think that there are differences in how we understand getting on the ground in the world, and that's what's interesting to debate."" That is one of the questions being considered by several committees examining how to take the Core abroad. One of the committees, led by Dean of Humanities Pierre Force, is looking to start programs inParis, Istanbul, and Santiago. Force said that instructors would teach several Core courses abroad for one semester each, starting as early as fall of 2013. The proposed classes, which are under consideration by Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks, would cater primarily to sophomores. ""Because the college has so many requirements in the first two years, it's very difficult for students to go abroad before their junioryear,"" Force said. ""So you can give students the possibility of studying abroad sooner."" CC students are required to complete both semesters of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization before studying abroad, according to the Office of Global Programs website. Force added that the idea of bringing the Core abroad would be a new model of education for Columbia students going abroad.While traditional study abroad offerings like language and cultural studies will still be available, they will not be students' main focus under the new model, he said. ""It would be a different way of understanding study abroad, in the sense that this category of students would not be required to have a vast knowledge of French, or to focus necessarily on French Civ, on their studies there,"" Force said about a possible program in France. But de Grazia—who is being succeeded as Paris center director by former New York Public Library president Paul LeClerc—said that the Core might be better off remaining in New York. ""The Core is set up to read text. It's not about place,"" she said. ""I just don't see what the big virtue is to reading Rousseau in France."" melissa.vonmayrhauser @columbiaspectator.com"
577,'Jesus Christ Superstar' Musical brings New Testament to life with talented cast,20 April 2012,"Musical brings New Testament to life with talented castBY DAVID SALAZAR Spectator Staff WriterWHERE IT'S AT Time: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. Place: 250 West 52nd St. Cost: $70.50-$l5OAlthough composed largely of Broadway newcomers, the cast of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival's production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" managed to put on a polished, high energy, and thoughtprovoking production of the classic rock opera. Beginning six days before Passover in the year 33, ""Superstar"" is the retelling of those last few days in the life of Jesus Christ, with the addition of some great bass and funky melodies courtesy of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Tim Rice. And while Jesus, played here by Paul Nolan, may be the title character, the play is as much about the people close to Jesus, their part in his crucifixion, and the impact his death had on them, as it is about him. Judas Iscariot (Josh Young) is put at the forefront of the play, opening the production with ""Heaven On Their Minds,"" a piece about the fame that Judas believes has gone to Jesus' head. The strong opener cast Judas in a sympathetic light, as someone who's truly concerned about Jesus and his followers. Watching Young's performance, it was difficult to believe that it was his first time on Broadway. Another exceptional cast member was Chilina Kennedy, also making her Broadway debut as Mary Magdalene. Portraying the professed savior's savior, she reminded him that ""Everything's Alright,"" but agonized that she can't truly help the troubled man. Peter (MikeNadajewski) and Kennedy united to sing ""Could We Start Again, Please?"" emphasizing how much their characters will be impacted by Jesus' impending death. Nolan, for his part, enacted Jesus' anguish convincingly, although he seemed to have a little trouble with higher notes. Other standouts included Bruce Dow as King Herod and Marcus Nance as Caiaphas, one of the high priests. Although both had issues with their performances— Dow bordered on overacting, and Nance's baritone obscured some lyrics—they were indispensable to the performance. Weber's music and Rice's lyrics not only expand on a well-known story, but also emphasize the effect that Jesus' death had on those closest to him, as they grapple with the realization that their friend is going to die. Jesus, at the same time, is forced to face his own doubt about his future. ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" as an artistic response to a Core text, would make Literature Humanities chair Christia Mercer proud. When reading the Gospels of Luke and John, one gets a pretty limited view of the events leading up to the crucifixion. ""Superstar"" creates a motive for Judas's betrayal of Jesus—a fear that the Roman occupiers of Jerusalem would arrest everyone. It also, then, sheds doubt on whether Judas really deserved his punishment. If biblical Judas actually had on the royal blue suit that he sports in the crowd-pleasing, climactic number ""Superstar,"" that answer is assuredly no.SING-ALONG SAVIOR I Stratford Shakespeare Festival's production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" reimagines the familiar Biblical story as a high-energy classic rock opera, with great bass and funky melodies."
578,"4 student artists, poets win Core Scholars Program prize",23 April 2012,"BY JEREMY BUDD Spectator Senior Staff WriterRowan Buchanan, CC 'l2, started working on an Ovid-inspired painting without any intention of submitting it for the second annual Core Scholars Program. ""I just really, really like Ovid,"" she said. ""I was doing them, and at some point somebody told me about the Core Scholar thing, and I said, 'Oh, I guess this really fits.'"" This weekend, Buchanan and three other students—Marian Guerra, CC 'l4, Gabriela Pelsinger, CC 'l4, and Anneke Solomon, CC 'ls—were named winners of the Core Scholars Program, a distinction that comes with a $2OO cash prize. Each of them submitted a ""Core Reflection"" that expressed, questioned, or analyzed an idea presented in a Core class. The competition was open to all students who have taken a Coreclass. Ovid also inspired Solomon to enter, albeit spontaneously, she said. ""I had actually written a poem that was loosely based on the Daedalus story, but I didn't want to submit just one poem,"" she said. ""I went back through what we were reading for Lit Hum and found the characters that I found most fascinating and began to play with them."" Solomon's poem, ""Departure— In Four Parts,"" is a response to the stories of four Literature Humanities characters: Daedalus, Dante, Daphne, and Dido. The alliteration of the characters' names was unintentional, but it became a way to unite the poem, Solomon said. Pelsinger won for a spokenword poem in which she responds to Eve's story in Genesis.Guerra, a Spectator news writer, won for a painting of Sonya reading the story of Lazarus in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment."" ""I created the piece last year as a final project for Lit Hum—our teacher basically wanted something very similar to what the Core Scholars Program wanted,"" she said. ""I thought that a painting would be most fitting since I wanted an excuse to allocate more time to painting."" Gurrera said that while she used to paint daily during high school, she had struggled to find the time for it at Columbia. ""I hadn't painted in a longtime, but having this opportunity to use my time to actively engage with a text that I really liked was a good thing,"" she said. ""There was nothing to lose when applying."" Raphael Peterson, GS 'l2, and Lesley Thulin, CC 'l4 and a Spectator A&E associateeditor, earned honorable mentions. Peterson said that it felt good to be recognized as a ""creative person."" ""I feel like there's so much to get out of all the texts,"" he said. ""They almost require that you respond in this way to engage in that dialogue."" Thulin made a sculpture in response to a scene in Ovid's ""Metamorphoses"" in which a flood annihilates the ""corrupt majority."" Peterson composed a piece of experimental music that responds to the process of selfdiscovery in Plato's ""Symposium"" and ""Republic."" ""I am a musician, so music is definitely my primary mode of expression,"" he said. ""That's more or less it—l started working on that piece and then decided that it represented a lot of things I thought about throughout the Core Curriculum."" Peterson said that focusing on a specific idea or passage was difficult for him.""It's challenging to figure out how to create something in response to these texts,"" he said. ""How do you absorb all of these ideas?"" For Buchanan, a senior, the Core Scholars Programs offered a chance for her to reflect on all the time she had spent in Core classes. ""It was a nice way to look back and think about things I hadn't consciously thought about,"" she said. ""It helped me to look at the Core more as a whole than just as a, 'This is your reading for the week, do it.'"" Solomon felt that writing her poem helped her to connect with the Lit Hum texts on a different level than most students do. ""I didn't look at them so rationally,"" she said. ""When I'm in class, I feel like I have to think about it in a certain way, but here I got to see the texts from a more emotional standpoint and connect with them personally."" jeremy.budd @columbiaspectator.comAT THE CORE I Marian Guerra, CC 'l4, painted Sonya reading the story of Lazarus in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment.""DELUGE I Lesley Thulin, CC 'l4, made a sculpture respondingto the flood in Ovid's ""Metamorphoses."""
579,STAFF EDITORIAL Talking majors,23 April 2012,"Talking majorsNoam Chomsky published his first book on linguistics in 1957, sparking the rise of generative linguistics and widespread study of linguistics as a discipline. Columbia had a linguistics program that rose with the popularity of the field in the '6os, but later dropped off before being suspended in 1991. Today, we are left with no formal linguistic department. A program was started in the early 2000s, but a lack of funding and professors has precluded any possibility of the revival of a full department—any student interested in linguistics suffers for it. As a recent news article highlights (""Linguists grapple with lack of a formal major, ablessing and a curse,"" April 19), Columbia remains only one of two Ivy League schools that does not offer a linguistics major—the other is Princeton. How can Columbia deprive its student body of a formal major in an established academic field? Offering a major means more than just allowing people to study a field. Formalizing a major legitimizes a discipline and brings it recognition. Currendy, students interested in linguistics can still study linguistics, albeit through a roundabout procedure of declaring an individual major. With a formal major, the University would be able to attract prospective students looking to study linguistics. Columbia might also produce more linguistics majors, as students wouldn't have to discover the individual track on their own. More importantly, Columbia would be able to revitalize an important area of academics that is currently dormant. Students presently have to go elsewhere—specifically, New York University—to take classes in rare languages. We understand that hiring experts in these narrow areas might be taxing and inefficient. But as the two most prominent professors within Columbia's linguistics program—Slavic languages professors Alan Timberlake and Boris Gasparov—will soon retire, Columbia needs to reinforce the core of the program first. To allow a vacuum to exist following their retirement would be criminal to any academic standards this institution retains. Revitalizing a linguistics program should not be a question of resources. Recently, Columbia College announced the formation of a new major, Medicine, Language, and Society, apparently formed to cater to the premed crowd who really enjoyed Literature Humanities. Although the University already offers a .number of courses that will count toward the major, a number of new ones are being specifically created for it Clearly, resources are being allocated for that new major, just as they were for all of the new majors that have popped up in the last few years. If it had the will, Columbia would have no problem scrounging together the resources to build a program as academically established as linguistics. The issue goes deeper, though. The role of a university is to make it possible for us to study, not to hinder our academic pursuits. In a field as influential and deep-rooted as linguistics, there is no reason for Columbia not to pave the way to a formal major and eventually a full department. We should not have to worry about makingthis happen from a financial standpoint—money should exist to serve ideas, not the other way around. From the student perspective, academics should remain an unimpeded pursuit, and it is Columbia's responsibility to make that happen."
580,Love the life you live,25 April 2012,"I hate Doodle. For those lucky few who have avoided it during their college careers, Doodle is an online scheduling system used to pick times for events and meetings. Its secondary purpose is the consumption and excretion of mauled souls. My obviously strong feelings about an inanimate and immaterial time management tool stem not from its inferiority to the design and usability of competitors like When2Meet. Instead my anger stems from the fact that every Doodle created becomes an uphill battle and a sad awareness of just how little time we all have. Doodle allows me to quantify and visualize just how much my work eats my time, just how few additional responsibilities I can stand to take on, and just how similar everyone's boat is. Though I love keeping busy and love my work, a snapshot of a Doodle can still act as a graphic display of the overload, isolation-in-work, and unwellness of my life as a college student. And it's a reminder that I do it to myself. When I got into Columbia a little over four years ago, I assumed I would be a middling student. My high school career had been defined by long walks, plenty of time to read, and a deep love for movies. School and extracurricular commitments were important to me, sure, but I always put a great deal of value in keeping free time for myself, and I accepted that this relaxed attitude and the strictures of college would probably mean that I would be a decent student and come out the other end as a perfectly content government hack with a ton of free time on my hands. But then I got my first A on a Literature Humanities paper. And it was so easy—easier than I thought it would be. Soon after, our first midterms rolled around and I was doing well, but still had more time than I needed. Then I knew that I could succeed here. I got bolder, took much more difficult classes, joined a number of clubs, and (wouldn't you know it) started writing articles and columns for the first time in my life. It was not a matter of competition. In truth, this is not an extraordinarily competitive school compared to others. But there was just so much to do, and with so many others so heavily involved, there were just so many hints and tips to learn to make more time. Success led to hubris. What started as exclamations of honest surprise at my accomplishments grew more self-con-fident and proud, eventually boastful. But the Icarus urge that this place can inspire, to always push a bit further, did burn me up. Eventually hubris shatters and the humility catches up fast and hard. I'd love to say that my first major failures at Columbia helped to temper my pride forever and taught me a good lesson about balance, but that would be a boastful lie. Instead, as I reflect on my time at Columbia, I realize that my time here has been marked by a yo-yo pattern of pride and humble pie, of being primed and encouraged to succeed and over-achieve and then decentering and crashing down.Columbia does a pretty good job of facilitating such oscillating experiences. There's a certain tyranny of choice on this campus that does encourage one to take a greedy bite out of the courses, lectures, groups, events, internships, etc. available to us. But it can also be a harsh, fast, and aloof machine that will allow us to crash back down, only to provide the space for us to rise up again, learn to stand, evaluate our mistakes, and once more climb a bit higher. There's nothing wrong with this back and forth. I actually suspect that it's a very good thing to test one's limits, flirt with pride, and meet humility hard. It allows us to find our identities, to learn in truth what kind of person each of us is. But it's important to recognize thai tn ,c nrocess of burn out, ego, and self-correction can be draining, especially when undertaken alone. There's potential at this university to become amazing human beings. But there's also the potential to really drive oneself into turmoil and pain if one pushes just a bit too hard—and it can be so tempting to push just a bit too hard.Ultimately, Columbia is not to blame for all of this. Columbia is a tool that we might bend to our ends. Yes, it is an institution with its own unique dysfunctions and it can help to create a more or less well environment But in the end, the majority of unwellness in our lives comes from ourselves. And total wellness, much like total bliss, is nearly mythic, given that we will tend to find ourselves at least flirting with unwellness for most of our lives. So the key—the one tiring that hopefully has been inherent in most of the my columns—is to recognize that. For me, I recognize the unwellness I create for myself every time I see a Doodle. And then I make sure to clear out enough time on my schedule to watch a movie. Unwellness, though our lives here may facilitate it, often stems from within us. But the seed to its cessation is within us. So be good to yourself. In the end, that's the most important element of wellness. Just get some distance, reflect on the tumultuous process of becoming who you want to be, and make sure not to let it drag you into insanity. Step back, breathe, accept limitations and craziness, and be good to yourself. That is all. Mark Hay is a Columbia College senior majoring in religion and political science.

581,Discovering goodness,25 April 2012,"Columbia College did not teach me what it means to be a good man. It certainly taught me how to be a smart man, a well-rounded man, a hard-working man, and an eloquent man. But a good man? That is where my college stopped short. To some, this indicates a successful execution of a liberal arts education—it challenges you without being preachy or prescriptive. I gained skills and helpful attributes that I will use throughout my life, but I did not have to sign on to a particular worldview or buy in to a socially constructed value-identity. If Columbia had tried to teach me what it means to be a good man, it would be a step back to a time when people were so presumptuous as to subscribe to concepts like ""good character"" and ""moral integrity."" This conception of the liberal arts education falls too far into the realm of postmodernist thought. It mistakes the classical values of critical thinking and Socratic pedagogy for the moral and cultural relativism that has come to prominence in the past 30 years. It makes the misguided assumption that questioning ideas necessarily means that all ideas operate on the same plane of legitimacy. Because one can question the most fundamental values of Western civilization, they say, they are not particularly special.The natural result of such thinking is that institutions such as Columbia must abandon the endorsement of any ideas of values if they are to be taken seriously. To have a stake in any particular tradition renders an institution tainted and biased, unable to truly educate or analyze. That is precisely why we have not been taught how to be good men or women. To do so would require Columbia to have a stake in a particular tradition of ""goodness."" Columbia should return to the philosophy it once had. At the turn of the century, our school still considered itself responsible for fostering the development of a well-rounded ""gentleman"" (with Barnard taking the mantel of developingeducated and refined women). In those days, courses not only facilitated intellectual development, but also worked to teach students the virtues they should cultivate in their lives. In the literary characters, philosophers, and artists under study, the students could discover characteristics to reproduce in their own lives. It was understood that 22-year-olds were still young enough to have their characters shaped. There is an immense value in having a university identify characteristics that it sees as important to a successful life. If Columbia's students are tomorrow's leaders, why would we turn a blind eye to their character and only consider their intellect? In the words of a Columbia graduate, Theodore Roosevelt, ""Character in the long run is the decisive factor in the life of an individual and of nations alike."" Why are we settling for such a single-faceted education when we could be benefiting from critical discussions about what it means to be good? The implementation of this character-building mission of Columbia College does not have to resemble Sunday school. The Socratic, discussionbased methods that already exist in Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities can and should remain in place. The difference will come in the faculty members of the school allowing themselves to promote values that are already lionized by the texts we read and the art we observe. It is only a matter of altering the conversation slightly—just add a few more questions to the mix. Why is it important to show courage like Achilles? Should we concern ourselves with morality like Augustine did? Are envy, lust, and the love of money really as poisonous as Jesus Christ warns? We need to concern ourselves with character. That starts with Columbia embracing values that it considers virtuous and facilitating a critical consideration of their merit. These values will not he exempt from analysis and criticism—like all ideas presented in a classroom here, they will be under intense scrutiny. The difference will be that that scrutiny will not just be theoretical, but personal. The students at Columbia will have to consider what virtues they want to reproduce in their own lives, and their professors will be there to give insight into the good life as informed by literature, art, and philosophy. It's time that we start graduating good men and women, not just sharp minds. Derek Turner is a Columbia College senior majoring in political science and anthropology.

582,STAFF EDITORIAL Activating faculty activism,30 April 2012,"Activating faculty activismIn a year that has been plagued by turmoil over administrative decision-making, one of the recurring themes has been a constant lack of faculty input in decisions that have far-reaching consequences for undergraduate education. At a time when Columbia College's relationship with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is evolving, the faculty voice has been underrepresented and disproportionately weak. Save for a handful of dedicated and usually tenured professors, the faculty remains quiet and relatively uninvolved in public with issues of undergraduate academic importance. The faculty voice is especially important to campus discussions. Members of the faculty directiy interact with students and understand their interests more acutely than does the administration. More importantly, while undergraduates are only here in four-year increments, the faculty remains at the University for a longer time, making it much more capable of influencing long-term change. To have faculty involved in undergraduate academic issues means a more thorough debate with the administration and, ultimately, a stronger representation of student views. Although this issue has been highlighted in the past year, its roots extend to the earlier part of the 19905, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was created to merge the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of International and Public Affairs, and the School of the Arts. Key decisions that had been reserved by the faculties of the individual schools—in areas such as admissions, financial aid, programs of study, conditions for graduation, grading, honors, examinations, and instruction—were transferred to the larger FAS body. While merging the individual faculties into one FAS body undoubtedly has had its benefits, especially in non-academic decision-making, the structure of the combined body has led to a decrease in faculty participation in academic issues. The very nature of a body designed to integrate interestscommon to the combined Arts and Sciences faculty influences the agenda in a way that leads the focus away from undergraduate academic concerns. Whereas a body such as the Faculty of Columbia College had undergraduate education as a primary interest, FAS subsumed it as one of many concerns on a busy agenda. Effectively, the faculties of the individual schools lost their platforms for discussing the issues exclusively pertinent to them—one of which was undergraduate education. The 1978 bylaws of the Faculty of Columbia College mandated that ""meetings of the Faculty shall be held at 3:10 p.m., on the third Monday of every month from October to May inclusive."" Senior professors who still remember those meetings recall that they were primarily spent discussing academic issues. When Columbia College faculty was subsumed under FAS, the meetings grew less frequent and more sparsely attended by faculty, and understandably so. Columbia College faculty meetings used to be devoted to undergraduate issues, but FAS now has to cover a wider array of topics. When it met to vote on the inclusion of Frontiers of Science, for example, the entire FAS was allowed to vote on the decision, even though many of its members did not teach undergraduates or adequately understand the Core Curriculum. Within the current structure of FAS, there is an effort to create a forum to recreate these discussions in particular committees. For example, the Policy and Planning Committee recently announced the formation of the Educational Policy and Planning Committee, composed of faculty and administrators with the intent of advising Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks on academic issues such as global centers and the Core Curriculum. On top of the standing committees on the Core and Instruction and some of the vague academic policy powers of the University Senate, there are some efforts to create the institutional framework to foster faculty activism. Yet the committee system, as it stands, is difficult to navigate, because the roles of each are unclear to faculty. All of these committees would be confusing enough if it weren't for the recent turmoil that FAS has recently undergone with the instability of provosts and the CC dean. On top of the confusing network of committees with seemingly overlapping jurisdictions, the committees have recently seen substantial changes. At the same time, meetings of the entire FAS facultyhave grown more infrequent. The problem goes deeper than just infrequent meetings, though—many professors don't attend faculty meetings, or don't participate vocally in the meetings when they go. According to a number of professors, this is because there doesn't appear to be a clear oudet for faculty to voice particular undergraduate concerns. Robert Pollack, a Frontiers lecturer and professor of biological sciences, said that faculty meetings need to be reconfigured so that they have a clear agenda. Without an agenda, the roles of each of the different committees are not fully realized or understood. At the recent town hall on the Columbia College dean selection, both Chair of Literature Humanities Christia Mercer and Slavic languages professor Cathy Popkin articulated that while faculty have a great deal of opinions, they don't know where to take them. If the various committees had their intent, aims, and scope fully communicated, then faculty would hopefully feel more included and willing to participate. Ultimately, according to Mercer, ""If faculty wete being listened to, more would be involved. If faculty voices could be heard more easily, then we would hear more of them. I also think that more faculty governance would change the culture of faculty, create a greater sense of belonging."" For faculty voices to be heard, professors need to see that advisory committees are influencing administrative decisionmaking. Furthermore, existing committees must clearly delineate their advisory scope and extend membership to dedicated and knowledgeable professors. We find it hard to believe that diminished faculty activism is a result of apathy. Passionate and interested professors surely still exist, but they need to regain forums to discuss issues relevant to undergraduate education. FAS is important for larger, more universal faculty concerns such as benefits and housing, which are crucial to recruiting and maintaining top-notch professors. The committees are important for addressing more specific undergraduate academic issues, and with greater clarity to their role and agenda, the committees can begin to function more as an outlet for faculty to be heard. If faculty activism increases, the strength of the undergraduate education will only be cemented and augmented. In the end, though, our faculty members needs to feel like they're being heard—only then will they speak loudly and clearly."
583,"No longer interim dean, Valentini sets long-term goals",4 September 2012,"BY FINN VIGELAND Spectator Senior Staff WriterIf there's such a tiling as a populist dean, James Valentini is it. The chemistry professor—who was thrust into the role of interim dean of Columbia College one year ago, following the sudden resignation of Michele Moody-Adams—-won undergraduates' admiration by endorsing his student-selected nickname, Deantini, personally matching gifts at the kickoff event for the Senior Fund, supporting the Student Wellness Project, and referring to Harvard as ""that school in Cambridge, Mass., that is erroneously considered to be our peer."" And having shed the interim title in June, Valentini is now moving forward into the semester with an ambitious set of long-term, stu-dent-focused initiatives. In an interview in his Hamilton Hall office in June, he spoke eagerly about his goals, including changes to the admissions and financial aid offices, more funding for student-led community-building groups, and new financial support for the Core Curriculum. LONG-TERM INITIATIVES As interim dean, Valentini said, ""there are long-term initiatives that you can't begin."" ""People won't sign on to them, because they don't know if you're going to be here for three days or 30 days, and they're pretty convinced that the University hasn't made a commitment to your leadership for a long time, or you wouldn't have interim after your name,"" he said. One change that Valentini felt comfortable making was moving the admissions and financial aid offices out of the Division of Student Affairs and into his purview. Both offices are responsible for CC and the School of Engineering and Applied Science. ""We're going to have admissions and financial aid be an office that reports directly to me,"" Valentini said. ""Admissions and financial aid is a very visible, important partofwhatwedo. Whom we admit to the college really is what determines what the college is like ... We have to show how significant that is by having that effort report directly to the dean."" The combined office is now being helmed by Jessica Marinaccio, who previous was dean of undergraduate admissions. Additionally, Valentini said, now that he is permanent deanit will be easier to move forward on a campaign to endow the Core Curriculum, a $lOO-million effort to ensure the sustainability of the college's nearly century-old academic requirement. The college has struggled to staff the Core, with only a quarter of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization sections taught by tenured or tenure-track professors in the 2010-11 academic year. Although they will both be on leave this year, Contemporary Civilization chair Matthew Jones and Lit Hum chair Christia Mercer have already hosted exploratory discussions with students in those courses. Valentini said he has spoken to faculty and alumni ""but in a kind of small-scale, ad hoc way. In the fell, we'll start a much more organized discussion about this,"" one that will involve more students. LISTENING TO STUDENT CONCERNS Valentini has sat down with students and attended council meetings far more often than MoodyAdams did. He also makes a point of trying never to forget a student's name. ""When I talk to former students—alumni—they say, ""Well, when I was a student, if you saw the dean it was because you were in trouble,'"" he said. ""That's very odd to me."" In anticipation of the search for a permanent dean, the Columbia College Student Council laid out a set of expectations for the new dean, which included regular meetings with the CCSC president, monthly emails and quarterly addresses to the student body, and a willingness ""to meet with students through events such as town halls, discussion groups, etc. to receive feedback and recommendations on relevant CC issues."" ""They clearly stated that they liked having interactions and they'd like to see that continue,"" Valentini said. ""And I think that's valuable and should [continue]."" During his conversations with students this year, Valentini said there was a recurring theme: '""We'd like to have a greater sense of community.'"" He cited two student projects as indicative that a dialogue about community-building is already underway: the Student Wellness Project, which was born out of the campus response to the suicide of junior Tina Bu last year, and the Pub, a proposed loungelike space in which students couldrelax, cook, and play games. Valentini said he wanted to remain hands-off in the creative process but hands-on in the administrative process. ""You go design it, I'll find a place for it, and I'll find the money to build it,"" he said. As for the Pub, which would probably be located in Lerner Hall, ""I don't know exacdy where the money will come from,"" he said. 'lt isn't like we're going to take away resources from other students to build it, but we'll find the money."" Another point of discord in undergraduate life that Valentini wants to address is ""about whether you're all being driven into finance and consulting."" CC students have long expressed concern that the Center for Career Education caters largely to students looking for jobs in those fields, a concern that received substantial attention this spring when the tendency to go corporate was the central theme of the 118 th Annual Varsity Show. ""We have to engage in a discussion about that, because I think student perception doesn't quite match what's actually happening,"" Valentini said, adding that the Varsity Show is usually an accurate gauge of students' feelings. ""What could we do institutionally, what information can we provide you, how could the career center's efforts change in order to help students recognize the range of options, opportunities that await them?"" One solution, he said, would be to do abetter job of connecting students and alumni. ""If you look at the trajectories offormer students, you see that they have lots of twists and turns in their lives, in their careers. They wind up doing things they never would have anticipated doing when they were students,"" he said. ""Their life stories are so interesting. I think you'd find it reassuring."" A CHANGING ARTS AND SCIENCES Valentini has taken the helm of Columbia's most visible school during a period of great structural change. In April, A&S—which is made up of CC and five other schools—completed an administrative restructuring process eight years in the making. At the heart of the changes was the creation of an executive committee—composed of Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences dean Carlos Alonso, and Valentini—and the re-establishment of the Planning and Budget Committee. Valentini said that while the new structure has been in place for only a few months, it's been smooth sailing so far. ""The trustees approved it in their March meeting, it was started to be implemented in April, the academic year ends in May—it's just getting going,"" he said. ""But so far, they've all worked. The PPC [Planning and Policy Committee], P&B [Planning and Budget], the Executive Committee—every part I've been involved in, it all works."" The Executive Committee, which meets twice a week, has focused on developing large-scaleA&S projects and hiring strategies. ""We're setting what faculty lines can we recruit into, and in what departments,"" Valentini said. ""What capital projects can we propel... like renovations, labs, new facilities? And how are we going to organize our development efforts?"" As part of the A&S restructuring process, Columbia commissioned the consulting firm McKinsey & Company to do an analysis. McKinsey recommended several structural changes last summer, among them that the University consolidate some of the power of individual colleges' deans into the central A&S administration. While these recommendations likely contributed to MoodyAdams' resignation, most of them were never implemented. ""I don't think anyone's worried about anything we were worried about last August or September,"" Valentini said, referring to the concerns raised by McKinsey's recommendations. ""I think we've moved beyond that."" Still, Moody-Adams has not spoken publicly about her resignation, and Valentini has not had a private conversation with her since she resigned. When asked in April why he had not spoken to her, he said only that ""legal was the operative word."" Over the last year, he has largely steered clear of discussing Moody-Adams, and he again declined to do so in the June interview. 'BEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD' For Valentini, becoming dean of Columbia College marks a high point in an already successful career. Having joined the faculty in 1990, he had previously served as chair of the chemistry department and director of undergraduate studies for chemistry, and as a member of the Committee on the Core Curriculum, the Committee on Instruction, and the University Senate. ""I'm thrilled, honored, excited,"" he said. ""It's the best job I've ever had."" After a year on the job, he still gets excited when he talks about working with Columbia students, explaining with genuine enthusiasm what he likes about them most ""The students of Columbia are just fantastic,"" he said. ""They're not aggressive like, 'Get out of my way, give me what I want, do what I want.' They're aggressive like, 'I want to achieve something, I want to accomplish something, how can I work with you to do that? What can we get done? What can I contribute to the University?'"" finn.vigeland @columbiaspectator.comDEANTINI I Valentini became a student favorite as interim dean."
584,Student impostor removed from campus,10 September 2012,"BY FINN VIGELAND Spectator Senior Staff WriterRhea Sen started off her August at Columbia as any nevy student would: going on bus tours around the city, taking photos with new acquaintances, discussing the perks and quirks of each residence hall. The only problem? Rhea Sen doesn't go to Columbia. Her nearly two-week stay on campus, during which she posed as a student, attended orientation events, and harassed firstyears, came to an abrupt end on Thursday night as the young woman—about 20 years old and 5-foot-4—was escorted out of Low Library by officers from the 26th Precinct for trespassing. Rebecca Smith, CC 'l3 and an International StudentOrientation Program leader, first noticed the woman on Aug. 24. She was eating cereal alone in John Jay Dining Hall and gave the name Rhea Sen. She told Smith that she was registered for the Columbia Outdoor Orientation Program but had missed the program's departure. Although she lived in Philadelphia, she said, she was born in India, so Smith offered to try to register her for ISOP if she wanted. ""That's really nice, but I don't want to cause any trouble,"" Smith recalled Sen saying. The quiet girl gave Smith her phone number anyway, and Smith was given administrative approval to register her if she could get her UNI. Smith called the number, but Sen never answered.Smith said she didn't see her again for three days, but in the mean time, Sen went on a city tour and attended an Afropunk festival in Brooklyn, said ISOP leaders Louis Lin, SEAS 'l5, and Bruno Rigonatti Mendes, CC 'l4 and a Spectator finance and strategy deputy. These events were informal, Mendes said, so OLs did not check for the required ISOP badge—which Sen did not have, as she had never registered for ISOP nor even enrolled at Columbia. She tried to befriend new students, including Cami Quarta, CC 'l6, who believes she was the first first-year Sen met. ""We thought she was just socially awkward,"" Quarta said. ""She saidto me, 'Are you a freshman? I'm kind of lost, do you want to hang out with me?""' On her way to the party at the Bronx Zoo that capped off orientation week, Quarta and a friend wound up on the subway with Sen. Even though Quarta had been told to take the train to 180 th Street, Sen showed her a text message she claimed to be from her OL instructing her to get off at an earlier stop and take a bus. The two heeded Sen's advice, winding up far from their intended destination. A helpful police officer steered the three of them back on the subway. ""If I was alone, I don't know where I would've wound up,"" Quarta said. ""That was probably the first sign that showed she might have been a risk."" Soon, OLs started to get suspicious. Sen told Quarta that she lived on the sixth floor of Hartley Hall, and the next day that she lived in Carman 68, which is not the way rooms in Carman Hall are numbered. Students said they were still unsure where she slept across the 14-day period she spent on campus. ""Peoplesaw her running around, hiding in bushes, but as far as I know, nobody actually saw her in the residence halls,"" Quarta said. ""Eventually, she tried to make friends with our first-year students, and it just got to the point where her lies were too obvious,"" Lin said. Katherine Cutler, a Student Affairs spokesperson, said administrators first became aware of Sen's presence ""after several odd interactions with OLs and ISOP participants."" Student Affairs notified Public Safety and instructed students to keep an eye out for Sen after realizing she was not a student. ""I was so freaked out when I found out she didn't go here,"" Smith said. ""I always saw her on campus. She had different sets of clothes. She eyen had a big backpack during the school week."" Lin and other ISOP leaders ran into Sen early last week and asked her what her story was. ""She gave us a fake UNI and claimed she did not have her ID with her because she left it with a friend,"" he said. ""We persisted and she said she needed to go,"" and then ran off. Quarta said Sen went with afriend to a Literature Humanities class last week, but when the preceptor arrived, Sen left the room and waited in the hallway for two hours. On Sept. 5, she sent Quarta two Facebook messages littered with misspellings and dozens of English and Hindi curses. Students agaip came across Sen on Thursday and alerted Public Safety, who took her into custody. Shortly before 9 p.m., the police removed her from Low. She did not respond to a reporter's questions, but looked scared as officers led her into a waiting police car on College Walk and drove off to the precinct. A police spokesperson said that no person with the last name Sen was arrested this month, but Cutler said on Friday, ""The woman was taken into custody yesterday evening after yet another sighting on campus."" Despite Sen's behavior, Quarta said, ""I never felt in danger. I feel better now [that she's been removed from campus], but I'm more concerned about her ... she's more of a risk to herself than she is to me."" finn.vigeland @columbiaspectator.comNO TRESPASSING I A woman who pretended to be a new student for two weeks was removed from campus by NYPD on Thursday."
585,Lessons from the student imposter,13 September 2012,"BY OLIVIA LANSDALEThe other day, when I overheard people talking about a ""student impostor,"" my first thought was that they were referring to some kind of personality type. My second guess was that people were having friends attend their classes. I never dreamed anyone would try to get an education through that kind of subterfuge. I didn't know what to think. My first reaction was to laugh. I thought of the line in ""Mean Girls,"" ""she doesn't even go here!"" and imagined what it would be like to discuss deception in the Iliad with her in Literature Humanities. It was like learning that there are people out there who practice graffiti knitting (""Granarchy"": look it up). But only so much of it was funny. There's a difference between joining a team of nightly ""yarn bombers'""and sleeping on a textbook in a subway station: The former is quirky. The former has friends. While I've never disguised my way into a place of higher learning, there was a time in my life when, like Birva Patel, I felt desperate and alone too. It was all because I was trying to get into college. Throughout high school, college was the only thing on my mind. My list of coma-inducing extracurriculars took up a third of a single-spaced Word doc. I don't believe it's fair to compare my pretense with Patel's—feigned interest is hardly as big a problem as feigned identity—but I can't stop thinking about it.Even if the impostor was here on a dare, when someone's desire for anything—much less a particular school—is so extreme, then that person is experiencing something serious. A lot of us like to humble-braggedly talk about the ""insanity"" that is Columbia, myself included. But when you look at Patel, you can't deny that most of us are fine. All the same, it's worth revisiting the classic definition of insanity: repeating an act ad absurdum and expecting a different result. In high school, I was obsessed with concerns for the future. As much as I'd like to say I work hard here out of genuine interest in every course I take, I can't. I've passed up opportunities to study things like 16th century Italian poetry in favor of courses I judged more ""practical,"" like ""Introduction to Geographic Information Systems"", which would theoretically help me find oil. (I have no actual interest in finding oil.) All my work in high school got me where I am, but what's the point if I'm only treating college as High School Two? I pity Patel, but I'm also grateful to her. She's reminded me of how lucky I am to be here—and that I don't have to pretend to belong. Ask anyone at counseling services and they'll tell you that one of the most frequent statements they hear is ""I have no idea why admissions let me in."" Many of us don't know what we want to do after college, what we want to major in, or even whether we chose the right school. It's dangerously easy to assume that everyone else has got it figured out. Columbia is overflowing with opportunities, and regardless of whether or not you have a sheet of paper proclaiming the admissions office's belief in you, it's easy to feel lost. We see people speaking up in class, or heading tables at the activities fair, or performing in showcases, and we begin to doubt ourselves. We may think, ""Gee, I wish I could do that,"" or even ""I wish I felt that passionate about something."" But it's imperative that we have faith that we'll find our way. Next time you feel low, look at your CUID. It's real, and it gives you access to an entire community that's willing to help. If there's anything concrete we have to learn from our fraudster, it's that having too many choices trumps having none. The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in creative writing and sustainable development.Regardless of whether or not you have a sheet of paper proclaiming the admissions office's belief in you, it's easy to feel lost."
586,Do we remember 9/11?,17 September 2012,"BY JOE KRAKOFFDoes Columbia University in the City of New York remember 9/11? Everyone remembers exactly where they were on September 11,2001. We remember what we were doing, when we heard, and what we did for the rest of that infamous day. Where were you on 9/11/12? More importantly, where was the University and its leaders a week ago Tuesday? This may seem insignificant. It's not. 9/11 was the epochal tragedy in the lives of our entire generation. Just like Pearl Harbor and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and John Lennon rocked the worlds of the generations before us, changing them indelibly, 9/11 is part of our cultural memory, our collective unconscious, in ways we are only beginning to understand. As the first generation maturing in a post-9/11 world, it shaped our understanding of trauma, war, peace, and our entire sense of American identity. The nature of such a random act of horrendous violence shapes the way we perceive our government and the entire political and intellectual climate of the United States and world to this day. This is specifically true about New York City, where the momentous change in skyline was only the tip of the iceberg in the subtle ways its residents' lives were altered. There is something wrong when ""the greatest College, in the greatest University, in the greatest city in the world"" (according to Dean James Valentini in an email sent to every student on Tuesday, which did not mention 9/11) does not recognize or remember the greatest tragedy that the greatest city has ever faced, the greatest tragedy America has faced since the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1945. There was very little recognition of 9/11 last Tuesday on the Columbia campus. There was no email from our deans or president asking us to reflect on the history of that day. I had three classes on Tuesday, and not one of my professors asked us to take a moment to be silent in memory of the lives lost. Hell, none of them even mentioned it. Thebest our university could do was a speech on the Low Steps from Christian professor John Lennox of Oxford University attempting to reconcile the existence of God and suffering in the world. While admittedly timely, the Christian nature of the speech limited its audience dramatically. I have a different vision of Columbia University. Columbia must have a greater sense of institutional memory for 9/11. We remember the Trojan War and have enr tire departments dedicated to remembering the cultural horrors of things past. What is the point of learning about Achilles's great tragedy—and Western society's subsequent remembrance of him for it—in Literature Humanities if we cannot even remember our own history as residents of New York City? Given its prestige and geography, Columbia should lead the rest of American academia on this point. So where was it? Some may argue that it is better to forget, to alleviate the trauma, and to let sleeping dogs lie. Lennox's speech demonstrates the peculiar peril into which we are thrust when academic institutions fail to properly remember and mourn this tragedy. The danger, in other words, is that this horrendous event, which shocked and scared all of us, is politicized. The government of our country warped and distorted our collective memory of this trauma into an illegal war in Iraq in which scholarly dissent was quashed for ""national security reasons"" or as ""Un-American,"" millions of Iraqi citizens were displaced or killed, thousands of American soldiers lost their lives, and an entire region of the world plummeted into chaos. Universities occupy a unique place: They are sites of cultural memory. This is why we have the Core, to instill a wide swath of cultural appreciation in all members of our community. This is why we have maintain the banner on top of Low Library, commemorating this space as King's College. This is why we have such a great library in the first place. Columbia cannot hold itself up as the greatest university in this great city if it cannot even remember our own tragedies. Columbia must not turn its head away from 9/11.

Mellon Foundation. Ursinus, a liberal arts college in a Philadelphia suburb with an enrollment of about 1,700 students, created its main core course in 2002, more than 80 years after Columbia instructors taught the first Contemporary Civilization classes. Now, the two schools will collaborate, with the Mellon Foundation grant funding visits from Ursinus professors and students to Columbia, and vice versa. Columbia College Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said in an email that Ursinus used ""the Columbia College model"" to develop its main core course, a yearlong class called the Common Intellectual Experience. The CIE syllabus includes a combination of texts that are taught in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. ""We are extremely pleased with this opportunity to formalize those earlier links by sharing institutional knowledge about the challenges and opportunities of running a successful Core program,"" Yatrakis said. While Ursinus doesn'tmandate any other classes for all students, like Art Humanities and Music Humanities at Columbia, it requires that students fulfill distribution requirements across disciplines ranging from music to mathematics, in addition to completing the CIE.The Mellon Foundation funding will support ""visits from Columbia scholars whose expertise pertains to works in the CIE syllabus,"" as well as visits to Columbia from Ursinus Junior Fellows and select first-year students, according to an Ursinus statement. Additionally, an Ursinus professor will teach a Core class at Columbia. Roosevelt Montas, the director of Columbia's Center for the Core Curriculum, said that the partnership would help Ursinus troubleshoot as it continues to develop its core, and that Columbia graduate students would be able to takesummer workshops at Ursinus that would introduce them to a ""liberal arts pedagogy."" ""The main benefit to Columbia from this collaboration comes in the opportunities it will create for our graduate students to learn about teaching in a liberal arts college,"" Montas said, adding that some of the grant money will be used to create post-doc-toral positions for Columbia doctoral students who teach in the Core. The Mellon Foundation funding will also fund the establishment of post-doctoralfellows at Ursinus, as well as the creation of the MellonCIE Junior Fellows program, which is being modeled after Columbia's Core Scholars program.

589,First-year academic honesty workshops to start in spring,26 September 2012,"BY SHARON LIAO Columbia Daily SpectatorRequired academic honesty workshops for first-years, planned to start this semester, will be pushed back to the spring as the Office of Judicial Affairs finalizes the curriculum. Administrators decided in April to ramp up efforts to promote academic integrity among Columbia College first-years, and planned to require workshops of incoming students this fall. Instead, the program will pilot this spring and will be fully rolled out next fall. ""While we want to get things started as quickly as possible, we also want to be sure that all constituencies have been consulted,"" Dean of Academic Affairs Kathryn Yatrakis said. The Office of Judicial Affairs is still in the process of forming a committee to plan the workshop, which will be taken by every incoming student. Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs Jeri Henry said the workshops will ""assist students in identifying the skills that are necessary, and the resources available, in order to do their best academic work while maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity."" Yatrakis said that her office has worked closely with Henry's to think about the ""best way to organize and shape the workshops."" Still, during orientation, international students were required to attend a Judicial Affairs workshop on reviewing academic expectations in the United States. The discussion laid out the guidelines for""academic integrity, specifically about what we should not do: plagiarism, self-plagia-rism, rules for taking exams,"" said Marcos Martinez, CC 'l6, who attended the event during the International Student Orientation Program. ""For most of the international students, it's very important to have the rules clear, to have someone explain them to you, so you don't have any doubts,"" he said.In April, Senior Associate Dean of Academic Affairs Hazel May said that the need for an academic honesty awareness initiative partially stemmed from the need to set limits on collaboration, considering that students take the same courses in the Core Curriculum. ""I have no idea what the policy is,"" Eleanor Goerss, CC 'l6, said. ""I certainly don't know what would happen"" if a studentwere caught plagiarizing, she said. Roberta Barnett, CC 'l6, also believes the lines of ""what exactly is cheating"" can be ""fuzzy"" for students. ""It can be hard to know, which is why it's a good idea to have a general idea, a list, of what is cheating, so people know,"" she said. Barnett, however, is not convinced that a second-semester workshop will be effective for first-year students.""I think that doing it second semester is silly, when you've already had exposure to the academic world, and professors have already explained expectations,"" she said. ""I think that programs related to academic honesty should be interwoven into the programs that are offered, like in Literature Humanities and in University Writing."" Martinez, who said the ISOP workshop on academic integrity clearly outlined the rules, said he thought the workshops should be mandatory for all first-years.

590,"Jacques Barzun, shaped Core Curriculum, dies at 104 Barzun, CC '27, Ph.D '32, served as prof, provost in 50-year career",26 October 2012,"Barzun, CC '27, Ph.D '32, served as prof, provost in 50-year careerBY CASEY TOLAN AND GINA LEE Spectator Senior Staff WritersJacques Barzun, CC '27, Ph.D. '32, a major 20th-century intellectual and former Columbia professor and provost who left an unparalleled mark on the University, died Thursday night at age 104. Barzun, who had a major influence on the development of the Core Curriculum, died in San Antonio, where he lived, the New York Times reported. Born in France in 1907 in a suburb of Paris, Barzun was sent to preparatory school in the United States at age 13 in the aftermath of World War I. He entered Columbia College at the age of 15. As an undergraduate, Barzun was Spectator's drama critic; editor of Varsity, the literary magazine; and president of the Philolcxian Society. He was also his class valedictorian. He wrote lyrics for the 1928 Varsity Show, ""Zuleika, or the Sultan Insulted."" He taught his first class at Columbia, Contemporary Civilization, the summer after graduating from the college. He later served as a history professor and was well known for his humanities courses, teaching for almost 50 years. In the 19305, Barzun taught the first Colloquium on Important Books class, the precursor to Literature Humanities, with Lionel Trilling, and developed the Core Curriculum's humanities focus. Barzun served as dean of graduate faculties in the 1950s and then provost from 1958 to 1967. A European romanticist, Barzun obtained the rank of University Professor, the highest rank in the University, in 1967. Barzun was an outspoken critic of American universities andobjected to the politicization of the academy. He strongly condemned both student protesters and faculty during the 1968 student riots. After retiring from the University in 1975, he remained an advocate for Columbia and the Core Curriculum throughout his life. A devoted Dodgers fan who knew the team when it still played at Ebbets Field, Barzun once remarked, ""Whoever wants to know the heart and soul of America had better learn baseball."" That quote is now inscribed on the walls of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush, and was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor, France's highest award. He became a U.S. citizen at age 33. In recent years, Barzun lived in San Antonio. He had three children, 10 grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. He is survived by his third wife, Marguerite Davenport. In October 2007, a month before his 100 th birthday, Barzun was presented with the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates. At the event, Professor Emeritus of History Henry Graff calied Barzun ""the Babe Ruth of humanistic study and teaching."" Barzun remained interested in Columbia until the end. In 2011, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal criticizing Columbia's exclusion of ROTC and relating it to Pericles' funeral oratory in Thucydides' ""History of the Peloponnesian War."" ""Do Columbia's administrators and trustees believe that the students in the college should live by the values they are required to learn?"" he wrote. news@columbiaspectator.comTRUE COLUMBIAN I Jacques Barzun, who held two degrees and served as a professor provost, in (clockwise from left) 1961,1975, and 1973."
591,STAFF EDITORIAL Rethinking FroSci,26 October 2012,"Rethinking FroSciLast weekend, student representatives from the Educational Planning and Policy Committee, the Committee on Instruction, and the Committee on the Core held a town hall to discuss Frontiers of Science. In light of the renewed interest in discussing one of the most contentious components of the Core, we want to offer some of our thoughts on how the science component of the Core may be improved. To begin, we should examine its purpose. Frontiers currently exists as a series of lectures and recitations focusing on a wide variety of scientific disciplines, with greater emphasis on breadth and abstraction than on deep inquiry into any particular field. At the same time, it seems that Frontiers aims to provide exposure to topical subjects within the sciences and a basic toolset for scientific literacy. Students may come from a range of scientific backgrounds, but after Frontiers, each student should know how to use such basic concepts as stoichiometry and significant figures. This dual mission—literacy and exposure—seems to work for other Core classes. Students without significant background in literature or philosophy can still muster strong arguments in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization and succeed, gaining a deeper understanding of the literary canon and Western philosophical tracts while covering a range of time periods, genres, and ideas. But Frontiers may fail because it is modeled after a small humanities seminar. Frontiers tries to combine exposure andliteracy in one class, in a way that's possible for literary and philosophical studies—but the combination has not worked. Frontiers is not successful. There's a simple explanation for this. Learning in the sciences fundamentally differs from learning in the humanities. Scientific knowledge requires a grasp of certain fundamental concepts before there can be any ""meaningful discussion"" (the kind we experience in Lit Hum and CC, and the kind Frontiers aims to create in its recitations and assessments). Simply put, while one can understand the Iliad's plot without being a classics major, one cannot hope to understand fully and meaningfully engage with Professor Brian Greene's lecture on quantum mechanics if one is not fully versed in quantum mechanics. As students, we're left with two options: exposure to the breadth of scientific subjects, or depth of understanding of fewer topics. Administrators must decide the appropriate vision for the Columbia College science requirement, so that it can be implemented effectively. Reconsidering the kind of education Frontiers ought to provide is a broad and daunting question, but an essential one to ask at a time when the administration is seemingly open to revising the curriculum. If Frontiers is intended to provide exposure to a range of scientific ideas, it's falling short. Judging from the amount of complaints we have informally heard about Frontiers, it appears to us that a good portion of students—if not the majority—feels that the Frontiers recitation sections and class assessments stray from lecture material and lapse into weekly worksheets that do little to engage students. Refocusing the curriculum so that it focuses on lecture topics (as opposedto the disparities we currently see between lecture, recitation, and assessment) will go a long way toward addressing student frustration and making the course more appealing, and would provide adequate, in-depth exposure to a variety of scientific subjects. On the other hand, if the goal of Frontiers is scientific literacy, we should consider eliminating Frontiers altogether, and narrow the breadth of the science requirement so that it requires students to take courses in the lab sciences. Frontiers attempts to provide students with some familiarity with the scientific method and process, but it falls well short of achieving tine conceptual familiarity that an introductory course in chemistry, biology, or physics does. Even with a two-course science requirement meant to supplement Frontiers, the many available course options—including courses specifically designed for non-science majors—easily allow students to circumvent any sort of thorough engagement with the sciences. Instead of taking Frontiers, students should be required to work deeply within a ""core"" science: biology, chemistry, physics, or even computer science. If we decide that the purpose of the science requirement is to achieve scientific literacy, then we choose real engagement with the core sciences and eliminate Frontiers. If we find value in a course that seeks to expose students to a range of scientific topics, then we keep Frontiers, but have recitations and assessments focus on lecture material, not on basic science skills. Either way, the Frontiers of Science curriculum, and the science requirement as a whole, needs serious evaluation, and its purpose in the Core must be articulated before these changes can be made."
592,USenate passes resolution honoring Barzun,12 November 2012,"BY MARGARET MATTES Spectator Senior Staff WriterThe University Senate unanimously passed a resolution honoring the memory of longtime professor and former provost Jacques Barzun, CC '27, M.A. '2B, Ph.D. '32, at Friday's plenary. The resolution was the only piece of new business on the senate's agenda, continuing a series of uneventful plenary meetings. Barzun, who died late last month, was remembered in the resolution for his many academic, administrative, and personal accomplishments during his tenure as a Columbia faculty member from 1932 to 1975. Developing the precursor to Literature Humanities and changing the color of Columbia's academic robes from black to light blue were among the many contributions the senate recognized. ""The Columbia University Senate venerates the memory of an intellectual giant, an ev-er-curious scholar, a respected colleague, and a beloved teacher for three-quarters of a century,"" University President Lee Bollinger said as he read the resolution aloud to the senate body. Bollinger alsonoted Thursday's resignation of Executive Vice President for Arts and Sciences Nicholas Dirks. He expressed disappointment that Dirks would be leaving the University, but also said that ""it's a great thing for Nick, and it's a great thing for our reputation."" Bollinger said he and University Provost John Coatsworth will be working closely with individual schools as well as the newer administrative committees of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, such as the Policy and Planning Committee, until Dirks' replacement is hired. Also at the plenary, School of International and Public Affairs professor Sharyn O'Halloran, the chair of the senate's executive committee, updated the senate on a number of initiatives currently making their way through the committees. The External Relations and Research Policy Committee is in the process of reviewing a September report by the senate's task force on smoking policy that found the current 20foot smoking ban ineffective and has determined a timeline for moving forward. According to O'Halloran, a town hall will likely be held in January, followed bya presentation of recommendations to the senate in February, and, hopefully, a vote by March. A possible campus-wide smoking ban has been debated within the senate for over two years. O'Halloran also called upon Coatsworth to update the senate on the Provost's Academic Leadership Institute, which held its first training sessions last week. Coatsworth said that he was very pleased with the training sessions, in which about 30 Columbia administrators participated, and hopes to expanding the institute. ""I think what we learned is that we don't do a very good job of putting our faculty in touch with each other so they can share experiences and knowledge and solutions,"" Coatsworth said. ""Those who attended found it to be very valuable."" O'Halloran added that the senate's Global Initiatives Task Force will be giving a report in December. Members of the University's finance department will also speak about Columbia's new financial documentation system, Accounting and Reporting at Columbia, at next month's session. margaret.mattes @columbiaspectator.comIN MEMORIAM I At a relatively uneventful University Senate primary, senators approved a resolution honoring longtime professor and former provost Jacques Barzun, CC '27, M.A. '2B, Ph.D. '32."

594,Creating a timeless Core,26 November 2012,"A tthe dawn of human civilization, .inhumanity's science consisted of fire and the stone-hewn spear; humanity's art consisted of crushed berries smeared on the walls of caves and pregnant women whittled from tree branches. We've come a long way since then. The arts and sciences are both extremely progressive—each step building sequentially on the ones before to create a composite whole more complex and nuanced than what was. Yet, K-12 education, the Core Curriculum, and introductory survey courses at Columbia and across the nation treat the millennia-long flowering of human art and science in very different ways. The history of science is skimmed to reach a privileged present. The current state of art is ignored in serfdom to a privileged past. Through reforms of die Core Curriculum, Columbia could take steps towards addressing these issues and gesture at a happy middle ground—one that puts before students both the steady accretion of human knowledge and what we have built on those layered foundations. The claim that the arts and sciences are progressive is not without a certain obviousness and a certain controversy. On the one hand, any person who has thought creatively, as an artist or scientist, understands the cumulative nature of creative inspiration. We look at and rely on, consciously or not, the work of those who came before. Building a car, coding a computer, writing a novel, painting a portrait—each requires a close understanding of techniques used before, successfully and unsuccessfully. The artist imitates in the form of his composition, the scientist in die setup of her experimentThe controversial aspect of the progressive claim is the implication that the arts and sciences of today are better, or at least more complex, than those of yesterday. This argument is almost invariably made about art—what Columbian has not heard the familiar refrain, ""It all goes downhill from the 'lliad'""? In the visual arts, ""older is better"" is a hard argument to make. There is a clear improvement in the control artists have over their vision as they move from handprint painting, to crude wood brushes, to fine hair brushes, to the pixel-pre-cise digital paintbrush of the present day. The bulbous dolllike sculptures of the Indus Valley Civilization hold no candle to the stunning bronze statuary forged in a neighboring region 3,000 years later. But with literature, progress is less obvious. Part of the blame must go to translation, which cleans up some of the ambiguities and incomprehensible references of the original text. But there is also a flaw in the way the texts are presented—through a dense and sophisticated critical eye, with the weighty label of ""classic."" We see these texts through layers of thorough analysis by modem scholars, and with the assumption that appreciation of these works will somehow make us better, more tasteful people. We approach these works in a way tine authors never intended, in a societal context they could never imagine. What we are discussing and hearing in class is not the text itself, but an impromptu work of modem criticism layered over it. Literature Humanities typifies one side of the problem. The class purports to be a class in literature, but it would more accurately be called a class in the history of literature. The most modem text on the syllabus is nearly 100 years old and the majority of the year is spent at least a millennium before the present. The syllabus accurately charts the development of a medium, but it ignores where this development has brought us. A narrative of chained inspirations is often explicidy articulated, each text referenced by the next, but the story is left unfinished. What were the fruits ofour artistic project? What great insights into the present human condition did our countless years of collective toil gain us? As I write and you read, profoundly talented writers use the wisdom of the ages to comment on the world we live and breathe in, but Lit Hum does not tell their story. The history of literature is not useful by itself—we need literature's present as well. Science education provides the other extreme. The history of science is an unfortunately fallow field at the Columbia undergraduate level, and professors in the sciences (especially when teaching major-track classes) often seem to forget that their continuing project of observing and articulating the laws of the universe is an inherited one, passed down from thinkers in the primordial human generation. When the history of science is taught, it is presented as a more limited version of science's present: We learn Newtonian mechanics before general relativity not, we are told, because one leads to the other, but because it is easier and an acceptable shortcut in sufficiendy humanscale circumstances. The relationship between tire links in humanity's unbroken chain of scientific knowledge are not described; rather, the past theory is demoted to a cruder, simpler, easier-to-learn version of the present theory. Frontiers of Science and other introductory science surveys could take a lesson from Lit Hum and trace the genetic material of ancient theories through to those of the present. The arts should look from their past to their present. The sciences should look from their present to their past. If Frontiers and Lit Hum met somewhere in the middle, then perhaps we would get a better Core. Alex Collazo is a Columbia College senior majoring in creative writing and economics-philosophy.

595,Being thankful,28 November 2012,"I often get asked what brings all Columbians together. Well, there are some things that immediately come to mind: the great community that is built by the Core Curriculum, our love for debate and philosophizing, and our propensity to go to Wall Street. But, I know in the back of my head that we all are also united in our love of complaining. It's almost as if the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is looking for that exact trait in our applications. I almost wouldn't be surprised. And unfortunately, the negativity starts far too soon after we arrive on campus. After the droll of convocation sets in, and we get over the first days of that college high, the new experiences, and environment, we start delving into our culture of complaining. All of a sudden, the NSOP events aren't that great, the John Jay food starts to become less and less appetizing, our football team is losing, and we don't seem to remember why we even came here. But look at this culture we've created. We always seem to pass off these complaints as jokes or snide remarks to our friends, but perhaps we're actually hurting ourselves by thinking so negatively. We've systematically embodied an environment in which we have a hard time thinking positively when we are entrenched with pessimism. When our student body is focused on what we don't have and what our school is lacking, how can anyone expect anything different? Just take a look at the types of things that the other columnists and I write about. We don't always riddle our columns with complaints, but we often do, whether we're discussing the Center for Career Education not being up to par with other schools or the lack of student space on campus. It's probably too easy to say that thinking positively helps, but it's true. Look at the science. Countless studies have shown that thinking positively can release endorphins, the neurotransmitters commonly known as the ""feel-good"" chemical. But what's the risk when you think negatively? Well, according to a study by Mental Health America, people who were pessimistic had a 20 percent higher chance of dying over a 30-year period than people who were optimistic. I'm not trying to scare anyone into thinking positively, but rather to show that tthe way we think about ourselves, our school, and our environment can have detrimental effects.Students are slowly starting to realize this epidemic here on campus, and I think the attitude is slowly beginning to change. We've seen groups of students come together to initiate the Student Wellness Project and the Columbia Compliments Facebook page. These two groups alone—although there have been many other student organizations pushing for wellness and adding positivity to our campushave helped reformat the conversations that we have during stressful periods of our lives here on campus. Whenever a group like this throws an event, there are always countless replies about how Columbia needs this, how this is something so different for Columbia. But it shouldn't have to be something described as foreign or alien to our university—it should be natural. As individuals, we need to start looking at all the great opportunities we have here at Columbia. This column follows the Thanksgiving season, but we need to turn the holiday season into a systemic outlook on our experiences here in Morningside Heights. As the semester continues on and we enter the finals season, we have to look at all the great things that we have at our institution. Tomorrow, we'll have the annual Tree Lighting and Yule Log Ceremony, one of my favorite traditions here at Columbia before the start of the winter season. It's these types of events that bring our student body together, and that we should use to discover the great things about Columbia. And there is more to be thankful for. We are fortunate to have professors who care about us as undergraduates and take time from their departments to teach us in Literature Humanities, who invite us over to their houses for dinner, and who spend countless hours in their offices, letting us pick their brains for their advice, wisdom, and knowledge. We are fortunate to attend a small school with a campus community in the middle of New York City and to be able to run into and pass by people whom we know every day. We are fortunate to have made really good friends who have our backs through some of the most difficult decisions and times during our college career. We are fortunate to be surrounded by people who are passionate about their interests. And even in what is described as an impenetrable bureaucracy, we are fortunate to know who our administrators are, and to have deans who say hello and interact with us on a regular basis. These are all things that brought us to Columbia, and they still exist. Let's remember that. Ryan Cho is a Columbia College senior majoring in political science.

596,"I didn't find love at Columbia, except that I did",28 November 2012,"BY EMILY TAMKIN""you like love right?"" That was the subj&ct line of the email wherein the editor of this page (yes, this one) asked me to write a piece, no more than 600 words, answering the question, ""What is love at Columbia?"" I had expected the email to contain a link to an ironic article, or an announcement in the New York Times wedding section, and was more than a little surprised to receive this request. I think many things about myself, but ""girl who is known for loving love"" is not one of them. I've never even owned a heartshaped pendant (this, Reader, is the mark of all true lovers of love). I was going to respond to the editor of this page that I was in no position to define love at Columbia. I spent most of my time as an undergraduate single. I did not graduate planning on shacking up (we still say that, right?) with some boy. I did complain plenty, with friends of both genders, about the seeming dearth of love on campus, and about how people either hooked up or remained in the same relationships in which they had always been, and about how it just didn'tseem like any of us prioritized love at all. When the chorus of Rihanna's ""We Found Love"" (In a Hopeless Place) came on, I used to scream, ""Columbia!"" (In hindsight, I did this more consistently than I should have.) Bui then I realized that none of this means that I didn't find love at Columbia. I found love in Literature Humanities. I found it as Dante followed Beatrice (although personally I always thought that he could have done better, but I digress). I found it as Socrates and company drunkenly debated what love is in Plato's ""Symposium."" (It turns out love is being pregnant with knowledge, but only if you're a man.) I found it as Odysseus made his way back to Penelope, having been away from home for a war waged over a woman. And I found it in the conversations I had with my other, equally clueless 17- and 18-year-old peers, trying to wrap our nervous minds around these subjects, as large and lofty as we were small. I found love in my Russian literature classes, wherein I learned that love means never having to say, ""But what do you mean you're leaving me after I ran off with you and committed acts that cannot be named in 19th-century novels? I'm ruined!"" I found love for those books, and for the language in which they were written, and for the places that the course of study I chose took me during college and has taken me since. I found love in the interest and enthusiasm with which I committed myself to the clubs and organizations I joined, and in the bonds forged with other students who did the same. I found love walking on Columbia's campus early in the morning, when nobody else was around andit felt like the whole thing belonged to me. I found love walking on the Steps when they were covered with people and it felt like the whole thing belonged to all of us. I found love with New York City. I found love with the people with whom I discussed love during my time at Columbia—with the friends with whom I fell down laughing (and sometimes, if I am being honest, crying) over how sad and silly the state of love at Columbia is.I found love with the person I came to be at Columbia, and I found love with Columbia for making me that person. This is not how I would have answered the question, ""What is love at Columbia?"" when I entered college, because that's the whole point: Columbia makes you see love, at Columbia and everywhere else in the world, differendy. That, to me, was love at Columbia. And in that sense, yes, editor. I like love. The author is a Columbia College graduate of the class of 2012.

597,Renovating traditions,24 January 2013,"Right around ﬁnal exam week in ecember, one of the elevators in John J Jay broke down with impeccable timing. = A month later, the elevator still remains broken. Housing explained to the Ofﬁce of ‘° Residential Programs that the delay was caused by the need to make a special order for the malfunctioning parts. The make of the elevator is so old that no one in the - ‘EAR/jig 8 country produces these parts for sale on a Y 9 Q N regular basis. By the end of the ﬁrst week Y 0 0n _ _ of classes, Housing has promised, John , , Jay should have two functioning elevators 'lVer S 1 ty again. i , John Jay Hall, like many other buildings A A on campus, was built in 1927 under the direction of the ﬁrm McKim, Mead and White. Throughout its history, the building saw very few major renovations for the sake of preserving its Beaux Arts architecture. Eighty—six years later, John Jay’s original facade still stands, welcoming 445 ﬁrst-year students every fall. f ’ ' “ ' 5” Columbia’s entire campus, not just John Jay, carries a timeless appearance, and perhaps it will continue to do so for many years to come. In fact, when the Northwest Corner Building opened in 2011, President Bollinger predicted that NoCo would be the ﬁnal addition to the Momingside Heights campus. Since then, all subsequent major construction has been restricted to the Manhattanville campus, which will predominately house graduate schools. As of now, the administration has no plans to overhaul any part of the undergraduate physicaliexperience on the Morningside campus. . I think all of us will be proud that our children, if admitted, will live in the same dormitories that we’ve come to love despite the many overdue facilities issues. Sit on the same wooden desks in Pupin. Walk the same ﬂights of stairs to the seventh ﬂoor of Hamilton. Read the same Lattirnore translation of the Iliad. People, especially at a historic institution like Columbia, regard tradition with great sentimental value. It is Columbians’ sacred duty to protect this legacy, which they believe is the best of the old. Students and alumni would , guard the building with pitchforks if the University planned to demolish the building for a brand new one. “Garcia Lorca’s spirit still rests in room 1231,” former John Jay residents . might shout back. . How do we know our traditions are sacred, inviolable - . standards of integrity and excellence? How can we be sure that there are no other alternative paths toward excellence? Is it possible that our shared legacy is merely a burden, _ ‘ a cause of inertia to progress? As one example, the Core has been the cause of heated discussion ever since it wasestablished in 1919. In the past several years, students have repeatedly written Spectator columns and op.-eds about the Core. Some have asked for amore robust science requirement, while others have asked that works of American writers be included in Literature Humanities. However, perhaps for diplomatic reasons, no one has recently suggested that the Core should be overhauled. At least at Columbia, the , general consensus appears to be that there is only one right way to obtain a liberal arts education. The focus of this piece is not about the Core, or even the John Jay elevators. What I am trying to say is that in our school, we favor piecemeal changes over fundarnental. shifts. We are comfortable with excising a book from the syllabus but never an entire course, like Frontiers of Science, from the curriculum. We renovate dormitories constantly or acquire apartments, but rarely discuss building one from scratch on our current campus. However, it is undeniable that the world changes outside our Morningside campus. It is possible that one day our small renovations will not keep up with New York City’s building code regulations. While I feel very lucky to have learned here, ‘ I also recognize that perhaps rﬂ education willnot satisfy the needs of the distan - ; re. Having only looked into stopgaps instead of tangible solutions, we might face an overwhelming number of overdue overhauls. We walk reluctantly with our eyes ﬁxated on our inherited history, while others are running forcefully without ever looking back. Our hesitation at retiring the old may stem from America’s short history. We fear risking our identity entirely when we sacriﬁce any part of our past, even if it’s holding us down. Last semester, I wrote about breaking down the walls of academic departments. I argued that in order to resolve the world’s increasingly complicated problems, we need cooperation among academics, laypeople, and others with contrasting backgrounds. I believe that there is no room for unilateralism in our future. No singular tradition and convention will hold tyrannical power over all other paths toward personal, institutional, national, or worldwide fulﬁllment. _ But after meeting some die-hard future Ph.D.s and reuniting with my older relatives over winter break, I wonder if there are certain traditions that are sacred. Traditions that are not ‘ mere conventions but actual truths without which we would be lost. It is my hope that we will one day discern the difference between truthand convention in preparation for ‘an innovative future that still preserves wisdom painfully won ‘ from the past. ‘ A James Yoon is a Columbia College senior majoring in environmental science.

598,Academic integrity task force proposes undergrad honor code,1 February 2013,"BY QIUYUN TAN . . Spectator Staff Writer» iThe’Aca‘demic Integrity Task Force has proposed an honor code for the undergraduate schools’ at Columbia to improve ‘ academic integrity. A C l Bruno Rigonatti Mendes, CC , E ’l4, initiated this proposal as i the Columbia College Student Council’s academic affairs representative last year. Mendes said that the honor‘ code would improve academic honesty on campus because it would be a pledge that students take themselves. “The honor code would be one of several strategies we would have to pursue in order to have a better—establishedcu-lture of academic integrity on campus,” he said. “It was one that required a sizable effort coming from students themselves.” Students in support of the honor code said that it would count on students to be respon- , sible for their own academic integrity and create a community culture that cherishes academic honesty. “We Want to make it a cultural thing and not about a discipline,” CCSC Academic Affairs Representative Steven Castellano, CC ’l3, said. “If you make it the professors’ responsibility, students will just ﬁnd more ways to cheat.”Task force members first hope to create an honor pledge , - that students take at‘convocations, and eventually, they plan to print one on the back of blue books for students to sign at every exam they take. Castellano, who is spearheading the initiative, said, “There have been so many studies that suggest that if you sign off on that, if you write out the words even as simple as ‘I did not cheat,’ you are much less likely to cheat because the idea is reinforced.” Jeri Henry, associate dean of judicial affairs and community standards, said that she was very supportive of the project. “If properly implemented, it would establish the values of the community, thereby shaping the development of students’ awareness of expectations and academic culture at Columbia,” she said. Barnard has upheld an honor code since 1912. According to students on the task force, Columbia and Harvard are the only two Ivy League schools without an honor code. The cheating scandal at Harvard last year drew national attention to issues of academic integrity and has since intensified discussions of plagiarism and cheating. Kathryn Yatrakis, Columbia College’s dean of academic affairs, said that professors often View cheating as a betrayal. “They themselves are scholars in their fields,” she added.“They understand well how it is‘to rely on the work of others——as sociologists talk about standing on the shoulders of gi- ' , ants——but what you always do is give proper credit to that. They also know that they would not i get to where they were if they do not do their own work.” “When students are dishonest, ~ it changes the dynamic of class.” Christia Mercer, former Literature Humanities chair Christia Mercer, former chair of Literature Humanities, said that she was very concerned about students cheating on Lit Hum exams and plagiarism in papers. “To have to worry about that just adds the burden to our responsibilities,” she said. “When students are dishonest, it changes the dynamic of class, especially a small class like Lit Hum.” She added that while some older professors may believe that their students would never think to cheat, a study showed that one out of 10 students is going to plagiarize on a paper at some point in his or her time at Columbia. Although largely advocated by faculty members, the effectiveness of an honor code hasbeen questioned by students. “I don’t think it would make a difference. If people are go- ' ingto cheat, they’re going to cheat,” Sarah Forthal, CC ’l5, said. “It already says on the syllabus that cheating isn’t acceptable.” Besides the code itself, the task force also plans to organize discussion sessions for incoming students to discuss the cheating issues openly. In ad- \ dition, it aims to reinforce the ’ code by incorporating it into core classes, course syllabi, and departmental meetings. “These two things, honor pledge and extended sessions for the new students next year, we hope to implement on a full scale by the fall,” Bob Sun, CC ’l4 and a member of the Committee on Instruction, said. “This semester, in the coming months, We plan to run a pilot program with freshmen this year.” _ ‘ “In the end, it’s really that the students’ individual sense of who they are decides their own integrity about whether they’re going to cheat,” Yatrakis said. = Sun, a Spectator opinion columnist, said that while he was uncertain of the effectiveness of the honor code, he hoped it would make a difference. “After doing all that, will it make a noticeable difference in the culture?” he said. “One year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now, we don’t know, but We really hope so.” . ° qiuyun.tan @columbz'aspectator.comDON’T CHEAT, KIDS | CCSC Academic Affairs Representative Steven Castellano, CC ’13, said he wanted to change CU’s culture."
599,Professor talks Core feminism,5 February 2013,"BY CAMILLE BAPTISTA ' « Columbia Daily Spectator Classics professor Katharina Volk loves Ovid—but the Core Curriculum doesn’t do justice to its discussions of gender and sexuality, she said in a lecture Monday afternoon. As part of “Feminist to the Core,” a speaker series run by Columbia’s Institute for Research on Women and Gender that allows professors to analyze feminist themes within the Core, Volk spoke to a crowded room in the Schermerhorn Extension about the themes of gender and sexuality in the epic “Metamorphoses.” “One possibility is to view Ovid as a protofeminist,” she said. “He’s trying to give women a Voice.” “The other way to think about it is that he’s an extreme sexist,” she added. - Volk, who received the Distinguished Columbia Faculty Award two years ago, highlighted areas of the Core Curriculum that neglect feminist themes. She expressed her desire for Columbia College students to read more than just books XII-XV of “Metamorphoses,” saying that many of the epic’s other books explore gender-related issues and that the sections students are currently assigned are “skewed toward male-genred themes” like the Trojan War. According to Volk, the battle scenes in “Metamorphoses,” which are heavy with traditionally masculine activity, are among those focused on by Literature Humanities sections. Volk questioned thepoet’s intentions in those scenes. “Is he actually denouncing. male aggression?” Volk asked the audience. “Or is this a kind‘ of violent pornography?” - Laura Ciolkowski, associate director of the Institute for Research on Women, Gender, and Sexuality, coordinated the series in an attempt to encourage Columbia College students to consider deeper questions about gender and sexuality and their presence in classic literature, explaining that the series serves as a “miniature illustration” of the mission of IRWGS. “It is no longer appropriate to deﬁne gender studies as the study of women,” she said, explaining that the series hopes to promote “messy, noisy, provocative conversation about women and sexuality.” A l Volk found comedy in many of the -poem’s gender-related themes because of, the unusual and daring way that Ovid explores them. “A mother killing her child...cannibalism... Obviously it’s problematic,” she joked as she reviewed the tale of Tereus, . Philomela, and Procne. “‘Metamorphoses’ is really a text that is good‘ to think with,” she said. “It’s great fun.” Hope Silberstein, CC ’l4, was surprised by the number of people who were interested in hearing Volk’s speech. ‘ “People here are really progressive, but at the same time, you don’t really think that these feminist outlooks on the Core ‘are really going to interest Columbia College students,” she said. Silberstein said she attended the event for the opportunity to engage in a richer discussion of feminist topics. Students in the Core “are kind of robbed of not only female authors, but female stories,” she said. Inez Bell, BC ’l5, enjoys translating Latin and is also passionate about feminism. She said Volk’s discussion highlighted a key intersection between the two ﬁelds. l i “It was interesting to combine two things that I wouldn’tnecessarily combine,” she said. Ciolkowski, who said’ she loves the Core Curriculum, explained that in designing the lectu_re series, she aimed to choose texts that don’t necessarily lend ~ themselves to discussions on gender or sexuality in the classroom. “I love the ideaof students’ coming to a program like this and then going back into the classroom and asking questions about gender and sexuality, and bringing that into the conversaV tion in the classroom,” she said. Upcoming discussions in the i “Feminist to the Core” series will cover texts such as Dante’s “Divine Comedy,” William Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” and Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment,” with each talk featuring a different distinguished member of the Columbia faculty. “We really see this series as being about a conversation with the core, to make the core experience even more rich, even more provocative than it already is,” Ciolkowski said. “It’s really about promoting conversation.” news@columbiaspectatorzcom"

V I find this practice distracting and annoying—the concept of the West is too broad and ill-defined to . be of productive use in most class discussions. Too many Columbia studentsemploy the term too loosely, ignoring the complexity of many ideas that often clash uncomfortably. An Asian humanities seminar, while discussing the Qu’ran, can easily spend two hours coming up with dichotomies dividing concepts familiar to the Islamic tradition with those of the Western tradition: communities and individuals, charity and self—love, faith and secularism. C A different Asian humanities seminar, while disA cussing the Analects of Confucius, could spend another two hours discussing a different set of binaries: filial piety and the autonomous self, observation of Wtradition and progress toward a telos, communal agricultural economy and free market capitalism. I I use the example of Asian humanities because I '' am most familiar with the courses and because my impressions are fresh. Yet I do not think it an overstatement to say that in our attempts to learn about non-Western cultures and question Western thinking, there is a frequent tendency to hastily toss a simplistic, sweeping, and inadequate characterization of the West onto the discussion table.

601,Deviations from the norm,8 February 2013,"I BY MARGO ROSEN ' I “But do as I say, since you seem to me not lacking in good sense. Take off these clothes, and leave the raft to drift at the winds’ will, and then strike out and swim with your hands and make for a landfall _ _ on the Phaiakian country, where your escape ~ After is destined. ' _~ A And here, take this veil, it is immortal, and fas— Office ten it under . ' your chest; and there is no need for you to die, Hours nor to suj_‘fen” ~ Odysseus knew how to build things like houses and beds, and he used that knowledge to make the raft that would take him off Calypso’s island. But I am fairly sure this was his ﬁrst try at crafting a seagoing vessel, and the raft was only good enough to get him from shore to the open waters of the great ocean. I love this passage for the way it shows that at some point you have to let go of What you are comfortable with and dependent on in order to take hold of something better that gets you where you need to go. This is precisely what Lit Hum is designed to help students do with their reading, thinking, and writing. Odysseus delayed letting go of the raft. It seemed to him that the goddess Ino, whose proposal I quoted above, might be deceiving him, and he decided to stick with what he knew: “I will not do it yet, since I have seen with my own eyes that the shore, where she said I could escape, is still far from me. But here is whatl will do, and this seems to me the best way. As long as the timbers hold together and the construction remains, I will stay with it and endure though sujferinghardships; but once the heaving sea has shaken my raft to pieces, then I will swim. There is nothing better thatl can think of.” I can’t help smiling at Odysseus’ plan, because it so neatly reﬂects that of so many of my Lit Hum students. I am surely not a goddess, but I am trying to hand them an immortal lifevest that can buoy them up as they swim towards their chosen (not to say “fated”) destination. Most students—particularly in their writing—resist this humanities ﬂotation device, clinging grimly to the familiar raft of vague and generic language until it is shaken to pieces.Each Friday, a professor will share scholastic wisdom readers won’t ﬁnd in lectures. Suggestions regarding which professors to feature are welcome. This is understandable. After all, the standard etude for writing in American schools, the ﬁve-paragraph essay (which all too often devolves to this: state a position; extract three quotes from the text and distort them as needed _to support your position; claim that you have shown the originally stated position to be valid), has stood students in good stead in the past. It is ahoary eminence. As renowned Swarthmore professor Sibelan Forrester observed, “It is the raft that got them here, but do they really want to carry it around for the rest-of their lives?” Like Odysseus adrift upon a rough sea, ona raft he cobbled together using skills he had acquired for other purposes, students are pressed in Lit Hum to risk abandoning the sinking writing exercise they know so well in favor of a more effective and—perhapé not incidentally—-more beautiful vehicle, until by exploiting , their own language and their own articulated thought, they ‘ A can reach the unknown shore. ' V ~« And look at what Ino. says next: having gained land», Odysseus must again give up what brought him out of his old difficulties and into what will surely be new ones. “But when with both your hands you have taken hold of the mainland] - T untie the veil and throw it out in the wine —blue water/far from the land; and turn your face away as you do so.” Letting go of tired solutions in the face of novel challenges is something all of us must do again and again if we are to master them, and ourselves, in theeffort to get to the home we envision. l Fortunately for our writing, each text on the Lit Huni syllabus presents a unique approach to how one expresses; ideas, thoughts, even— dare I say—truth in words. Each writer; broke the literary norms of the time to say something that subsequent generations have found valuable. As together we analyze the form and content of each of these works; extracting both the message and the method, we add to our store of possible modes of expression in our own writing. If-l encourage Lit Hum students to take this opportunity to let go their grip on what they think we want them to say and how they think we want them to say it and instead use their own language, logic, and imagination to convey their insights in writing. World literature is indeed a kind of immortal veil’,: and Lit Hum is an introductory course in drawing some part ‘of it toward you, wrapping it around you to keep you aﬂoat? i until you fetch up somewhere new, and then casting it away: so you can begin to examine what sort of land it is you have grasped with both your hands.

602,The West and everyone else,11 February 2013,"BY DAN lELA QUINTANILLA I’ve been living outside of the United States for a little over a month now. Cars drive on the left here. Bike lanes are more packed with commuters than the roads themselves are packed with cars. The Tube closes at midnight on weeknights and at 12:30 for those who want to stay out super late on the weekends. And, as one unlucky American friend of mine learned, you can’t refer to Queen Elizabeth II as “Lizzie.” The first real culture shocks I felt studying abroad in England this semester I were the difference in the education system and the shift in priorities placed on academic work. In one class that focuses on human rights and world politics, we discuss the authority of Western democracies and their interference in non-Western societies, “notably in Africayand the Middle East; this distinction most often comes across as The West versus The Poor. The Western “democracies,” as they are called, are both the perpetrators and the justified critics in such discussions. The West seeks to rescue the barbarians of the so—called “uncivilized world” from sub-Saharan Africa to the Amazon to the desert of Afghanistan by handing them our perceptions of what human rights are, penned by Locke, Hobbes, and the United Nations. For example, referring to female circumcision practices as female genital mutilation implies condescension and disgust, but the localized term “cutting” refers to accepted cultural norms and values. ‘ ' 9 We are so concerned with being racially sensitive that our discussion of culture is distorted. ' This dichotomy of the West and the rest of the world is appalling to me because it both dehumanizes developing countries and asserts that they are more authentic cultures without industrialization. At first, I felt that this alarming presentation was unique to the white guilt of the former British Empire, which, though a Western democracy, has committed its own human rights violations, notably the massacres in Amritsar, India, and Derry, Northern Ireland. But doesn’t _ Columbia teach the exact same dichotomy? V - What do you gainfrom taking African Dance, anyway? (Seriously. I implore someone who has taken this -class to tell me what intellectual enlightenment they experienced regarding Africa in the comments.) We are given a list of classes, a majority of which lie within the fields of anthropology and history, aside from speciﬁc. regional studies, such as Latin American or East Asian ‘studies. Perhaps a psychology course on perceptions ofrace and ethnicity would be more intellectually appealing than, say, Sex in the Tropics (Which I’m sure is quite stimulating, nonetheless). These courses fetishize non-Western cultures when they should be providing comprehensive studies of them. The Core makes up a third of our academic studies and is grounded in the Western canon, from literature to , music. We should be incorporating these race and ethnicity studies into the Core. We’ve already incorporated some works by women into the Core, with Jane Austen. in Literature Humanities and MaryvWollstonecraft in Contemporary Civilization. Last week, the university began a lecture series on feminism in the Core discuss-‘ ing whether Ovid was actually a proto-feminist and how those books of the Metamorphoses are passed up for the aggressive and paternalistic tales of Troy. But the various classes on “American history since 1945” neglect to mention the illegal and inhumane detention of‘ thousands of Japanese-American citizens in the western United States by the American government. Our Western democracies are so concerned with being politically correct and racially sensitive that our discussion of culture is distorted. We are the white West, they are the colored Other, and We are Civilized. Yet I say they are civilized, in their own way. The World isn’t black and white. In order to truly understand non-Western cultures, we must not tiptoe around them. The polarity of studying non-Western culture both as underdeveloped and more genuine is unhelpful, as is the chasm between repenting-for the actions of our forefathers and still considering ourselves superior to everyone else. We distinguish between the West and the non-West, but how can they be separated in our highly globalized world? To separate these cultures is irrelevant when they have been interacting with and shaping each other for centuries. ‘ iHistory is a comprehensive analysis of events and their causes and effects.

603,An imperative for honor,22 February 2013,"BY CHRISTIA MERCER Two years ago, when I was chair of After Literature Humanities, I wrote an editorial on academic honesty for Spectator Oﬁice (“Cheating and Dante’s hell” Mar. 31, 2011). I suggested that we have “an honest conversa- Houl‘S tion about the grave dangers of dishonesty” and asked, “What will you students do?”. My hope was that students would begin to take ownership of the problem and devise a solution. I suggested instituting an honor code. Last spring, the Columbia College Student Council initiated a serious conversation about academic honesty. Its l Academic Integrity Task Force has recently made thought- ‘ ful recommendations, including student-run sessions about 1 integrity and an honor code. I write to endorse these. I also i write to offer my help next year, when I will return as Lit f Hum chair to do everything I can to support the implemen- ‘ tation of these recommendations. I I The task force’s mai n goal seems exactly right: to create a culture of academic integrity on campus that requires student involvement. In this bizarro world, the onus of maintaining the honesty of students falls entirely on instructors. . ._ A v Why is this so importan thing. Right now, the burden of motivating honesty, educating students about what constitutes dishonesty, and maintaining academic trust falls on instructors. We waste precious classroom minutes educating students about plagiarism and valuable prep time devising assignments immune to plagiarism. We fret about catching—and not catching—cheaters, while concerned students have no opportunity to do anything at all. In this bizarro world, the onus of maintaining the honesty of students falls entirely on instructors. The task force’s recommendations are excellent and grounded in an obvious truth: real academic integrity must begin and end with students. Students must be the ones responsible for educating, promoting, and protecting themselves. Although instructors should offer support, only students themselves can create and maintain an environment of trust. The proposed changes will not miraculously rid our world of cheaters. There will always be some students immune to the ideals of their community. But the recommended policies would make an immediate and significant difference. Studies are clear: When students sign an honor pledge and actively commit themselves to honesty, they are less likely to cheat. As soon as Columbia students take up the responsibility of creating and maintaining a commu— W nity of honesty, they will have shifted the culture: A violation of trust is no longer merely between the cheater and instructor, but between the‘ cheater and the entire student I community. ‘ The task force’s recommendations should be adopted. They will have the immediate effect of shifting the primary maintenance of academic integrity from instructors to students. They will probably make a long—lasting difference by encouraging a culture of trust among students. This will beneﬁt students and let instructors get back to practicing and encouraging the highest standards of academic work. The author is the Gustave M. BerneProfessor ofPhilosophy.

604,Students debate how Core treats religion,28 February 2013,"BY SAMANTHA COONEY Spectator Senior Staff Writer Religious texts play a prominent role in the Core Curriculum, but at a discussion Wednesday night, some students said they were unhappy with how these works are addressed in class. A Veritas Forum panel gave six Columbia College students of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faiths the opportunity to reﬂect on their personal experiences with sacred texts in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization and discuss how these works could be taught more effectively. The panel’s moderator, Jonathan Lee, CC ’l3,' said that the idea for the panel was “a product of a shared sense of dissatisfaction of sacred texts in the Core.” . A “What ought to- be an enlightening ‘discussion devolved into a mechanical explication of these religious texts,” Lee said of his own experience with the ""Bible in Literature Humanities and the Quran in Contemporary Civilization. 7 T The students in the panel began by reﬂecting on some of the ﬂaws they perceived in the traditionally secular approach to these Works.“The professor wasn’t that aware of the text itself,” ffza Riaz, CC ’l4 and events coordinator of the Muslim Students Association, said, referring to the Quran. “There was a degree of separation from the professor and the text.” “You need to be able to understand the beliefs associated with these texts.” Q _ K —lfza Riaz, CC ’l4 V panelist Riaz criticized the View that these religious texts should be read without exploring their religious contexts. “You need to be able to understand the beliefs associated with these texts,” she said. Luke Foster, CC ’l5, the head of content for Veritas, a member of Columbia Faith and Action, and a Spectator opinion columnist, recalled when a discussion of the Quran in his ContemporaryCivilization class just debunked modern misconceptions of the text. ‘ “Classes need to be more encouraged to look at them in this comprehensive Way,” Foster said. “And yet, the class turned into an almost myth-busters session in a way.” Foster said he believes that the historical context and the author’s intent is crucial when examining these texts. “That basic sense _that our agenda is less important than the original author’s is especially important in the sacred texts,” he said, referring to the agenda of the Core Curriculum. Panelist Rachel Friedman, CC ’l6, said she believes thather Literature Humanities course succeeded in addressing the Bible on a basic level by focusing on its larger themes for students who may not be familiar with the text. “Ithink, in general, it’s achieving its purpose,” Friedman said. The panel also grappled with ‘ the question of whether religious students have a responsibil- _ ity to defend texts they feel to be misrepresented. “You can’t really represent an entire faith,” Friedman said. . Many students who attended the panel shared a sense of dissatisfaction with how these Works were taught in the Core. C Tatianna Kufferath, CC ’l5, said she felt that the texts Weren’t “addressed as fully and equally as they could have been.” . , “One of the points that I thought was very interesting was the idea that we can’t put a modern agenda over the author’s agenda,” Kufferath said. She added that she thought removing the original intent and historical context of the works “cheapens them in a way.” “I know that my Lit Hum experience wasn’t very engaging,” Kalu Ogbureke, CC ’l6, said, explaining that he felt that the Work was not put in a larger religious context. “If you separate religion from the students, you run the risk of not doing the work justice,” Ogbureke said. samantha.cooney . @columbiaspectator.comCORE CONCERNS | Ifza Riaz, CC ’14, Megan Armstrong, SEAS ’13, and Luke Foster, CC ’15, discuss religion in the Core Curriculum."
605,"Awn hopes to expand Lit Hum, CC for GS",1 March 2013,"- BY JORDAN F REISLEBEN Spectator Staﬁ” Writer Adam Gentle, GS ’l5, had what he calls a “rigid, preconceived vision of the world” when he arrived at Columbia last year, but he now credits his Contemporary Civilization course with helping him re-evaluate the world around him. Though Gentle is currently enrolled in one of the two CC sections exclusively for School. of General Studies students, GS stu- ' dents are not required to take CC or Literature Humanities as part of their Core Curriculum. But GS Dean Peter Awn said he wants to change this. “This idea ﬁrst started a couple of years ago, but the implementation has been a little, slow,” Awn said. “The key is that there are not enough sections for all of the students in GS, so you can’t make it a requirement.” Currently, GS students can take Lit Hum or CC to fulﬁll their literature or social science general education requirements, respectively, but only a handful of students can ﬁt in the two CC sections. A third GS-only Lit Hum section was added this year. Awn said that adding Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilization as GS requirements would be the “ﬁnal step” in synchronizing the Columbia College and GS curricula, a process that began in the mid-1980s. A Global Core requirement was added for GS students last year. “ '’ ' i “There is progress—not as rapid T as people would like it to be, but there’s progress,” Awn said. The primary roadblock to the addition of the Lit Hum and CC requirements is funding. “It’s an exceedingly expensive program to run, as we know through the college,” Awn said. “It’s not designed for efﬁciency, but for intense collaboration between the students and faculty.” Though Awn does not have a timeline for the changes he wants to make, he said GS is slowly increasing the number of GS—only Lit Hum and CC sections until it is feasible to require all students to take one of the classes. For Gentle, Lit Hum and CC were integral parts of his Columbia experience. “I think what makes a Columbia education a Columbia education is the Core,” Gentle said. “Given the opportunity, I would love to take the same Core requirements as the college, and I think it’s good for the GS degree to have the same backing as the college.” Ann Gleason, GS ’l4, is cur- ' rently enrolled in a GS-only Lit Hum section. She said she agreed that the Core is a deﬁning aspect of Columbia. “CC and Lit Hum are the back— g bone of the undergraduate program at Columbia University,” she said. “CC and Lit Hum remind one that Columbia is not just a trade school with the lovely veneer of classical architecture.” Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Dalia Inbal, an instructor of one of the GS—only Lit Hum sections, said that the two courses are important precursors to other classes at Columbia. . “From my students, I’ve heard that since CC and Lit Hum are such important parts of the Columbia curriculum, texts read in these classes automatically come up in other classes,” Inbal said. Inbal added that the breadth of GS students’ backgrounds onlyadds to the classroom dynamic. “Discussions are particularly rewarding and challenging given the very different backgrounds and life experiences GS students have,” she said. Sandipto Dasgupta, GSAS, teaches one of the two GS-only CC sections. Last year, he taught CC at the college. “To be honest, I wish I had a course like CC in my undergraduate experience,” Dasgupta said. Like Inbal, Dasgupta appreciates the diverse backgrounds of the students in his GS section. “As a teacher, it’s always a joy to teach with that because you have a lot more to work with,” he said. “When you have people with muchmore life experience, it creates a richer class.” ~ Awn said that ﬁnancial issues aside, the proposal to require Lit Hum and CC for GS students faces no opposition. “There’s no intellectual or administrative resistance, except we’re all realists about what can be done and what can’t be done with budgets,” he said. The next step, Awn said, is to fund a Core endowment, which he said “would help free up the tension for funds that could be used to add additional sections of CC and Lit Hum.” While Gentle is a proponent of making both courses requirements, he acknowledged the difﬁculties it could pose for some GS transfer students.“There’s a huge time pressure,” he said, adding that there “would? have to be some ﬂexibility” forl transfers hoping to graduate inf two years. » ‘ ’ Gentle said he wants to gradu-j ate knowing that he received the signature Columbia education. “VVe don’t want to be ‘lesss than,’ and I think a way not to be: ‘less than’ is to remove the per—Z ception that GS is an academically: less rigorous environment with: _ fewer requirements,” Gentle saidgj “Sometimes there’s abit of an insecurity—l like to feel like we’re re-: ceiving the exact same education”: “If the Core’s the same, then: we’re doing the same thing,” he f added. j jordan.ﬁ‘eisleben;_ @columbiaspectator.com"
606,Working hard at being happy,1 April 2013,"C olumbia isn’t a very restful place. Frantic faces and droop- \ ing heads fill Butler every night, and W .»_;. 5 denials of having been able to com- _ ‘ ‘ﬁgs; plete Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities readings are ’ commonplace. Everyone thinks Wist- Egxﬁ fully of those magical days of NSOP gggrgagg when we thought that we might actually leave campus to see the city F 0 ster sometimes. There’s a restlessness, a th eCOI. etone of desperation, in much of our campus political activism, too. It’s I nearly impossible to make the effort to listen to and respect a political opponent when you simply don’t have » the time or energy. I actually do have one friend who regularly sleeps _eight hours a night. He usually goes to bed at 10, but admits that he doesoccasionally stay up until 11 when someone asks him for help on homework. Hearing about such incredible discipline—coupled with self-lessness-—gave me pause. I had to wonder how I could lead a more restful life and thus have the energy to better serve «this community that I love. ~ Many of the manifestations of restlessness are_ staples of our university culture that we share as Columbians. There’s that lamentably pervasive feature of our conversations: one-upmanship in exhaustion. “I stayed up till 4 last night! SO freaking tired ' today.” “Oh wow! That’s crazy... I didn’t go to sleep - _ till 7 ’cause I had a paper to finish.” Some features are specific to this great and terrible city we live in. New York, after all, is a place where the buildings block the sky, green space is considered economically unproductive, and the spirit of careerism seems to haunt even the most idyllic sidewalk cafés. In short, our particular circumstances make stress a way of life. But I think there are also aspects of this restlessness that are specific to American life. America has been known as a place of energy, opportunity, and drive since before Alexis de.Tocqueville. De ‘ Tocqueville is astute and prophetic in addressing this topic, as he is on so many other questions. He calls I the great difficulty Americans have in being content with the status quo as one of the great strengths of democracy, because everyone has an opinion and works toward a certain vision of public life. But the flip side is a community-eroding restlessness that makes contentment rare and precious: “No one can work harder at being happy than Americans do.” Certainly both the good and bad of this democratic ferment were visible in last year’s election cycle: the passion, dedication, and genuine public-spiritedness, yet also the cynicism, backbiting, and apocalyptic rhetoric from both parties. "" What can we do to recover rest, both as the committed, driven, high-achieving, and enormously competent individuals that we are, and as the caring, generous campus community that we’d like to be? ‘Partly ‘it’s a matter of prioritizing: I’m increasingly learning—the hard way—that eight hours of sleep needs to be a bare minimum commitment in my day. But I think there’s a lot more to finding rest and peace than just good scheduling. A dear friend who graduated last year—one of those terrifyingly scholarly people who got a degree in philosophy, religion, and medieval and renaissance studies—enlightened me. He’s Catholic and he loves liturgy, the ritual prayer and worship of Mass. He applies that idea to the frantic urgency of everyday life. It’s vital to find little rituals—those small, time-inefficient but personally meaningful acts that can lend a sense of sacred dignity to our days and our relationships. We all live day to day ﬁnding temporary meanings. . This could involve baking for your friends instead of the much quicker, and more impersonal, Ferrisraiding. It might mean building a friendship with the gentleman at your favorite halal cart instead of treating him merely as an economic means to the‘ end of your full stomach. It might even me_an founding a club with friends to read Winnie-the-Pooh aloud to each other on Low Steps. My favorite “everyday liturgy” is reading an article in a beloved magazine before I fall asleep. I’m usually so exhausted by that point in the night—or early morning—that I just want to flop into oblivion. But reading reminds me of who I am and what I stand for, which is an even deeper kind of rest than sleep. - Even better for long-term rest is finding an overarching meaning for your life. We all live day today I finding temporary meanings—looking forward to ’ some treat or striving to finish some assignment. There are also those medium—term meanings that » drive us: getting into med school or impressing the interviewer for a dream job. But these things come and go, and their absence can leave us more wasted than any land that T.S. Eliot ever wrote about. It’s vital for sanity and survival and the ability to thrive ’ to find a larger purpose, a deeper ground for mean- 1 ing, and a stronger source of joy. For me, I understand who I am and the story of my life in terms of the hope of Christ’s resurrection. And that’s why I’m taking time from the myriad papers I should be writing to celebrate Easter this weekend. Whatever your purpose or ground for meaning, I hope you also take time to celebrate and rest, my beloved Columbia. v - Luke Foster is a Columbia College sophomore.

N o preservation SeC 0 n d society will ﬁght to preserve the ar- I mp 1- e S chitecture for its aesthetic worth. The - wrecking ball can’t hit soon enough, SlO n S and I’m glad that President Spar has the good sense to plan ahead. Barnard’s ﬁnances have been in shambles for as long as any current student cares to remember. It is telling that in the same meeting in which Spar announced her intention to replace Lehman, she simultaneously voiced doubt about Barnard’s ability to pay the $l5O million bill for demolition and reconstruction. _ More importantly, as the 21st century moves along, I wonder whether Barnard can continue to justify its existence as an independent undergraduate school alongside Columbia College. Meaningless rhetoric and labels aside, I wonder whether in 20 or 30 years Barnard will be able to offer its students a college experience that is substantially or even noticeably different from one at Columbia College. I wonder whether it does right now. I don’t want to compare mission statements or dwell on the merger between Barnard and Columbia that almost took place 30 or so years ago. We are told that Barnard is a small liberal arts college in New York and that Columbiaifis the big research university under whose ’ umbrella Barnard resides. Yet beside the label and the ~ rhetoric, I doii‘t see how the substance of a Barnard education necessarily differs from a Columbia College one. While different degree and major requirements exist, the classes that fulﬁll those requirements are often the same ones—with the obvious exception of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization. Degree and major requirements are, by design, ﬂexible and lenient enough to accommodate a wide variety of academic experiences. While Columbia’s academic program does not directly correspond with Barnard’s—that is to say there isn’t a Columbia equivalent for every Barnard requirement and vice versa—the differences seem to me more administrative and arbitrary than substantive. I understand that there are minute differences between the Columbia College science requirement and the Barnard Laboratory Science requirement, and that the Global Core is slightly different from Cultures in Comparison. Yet, it is entirely possible that two students, one registered at Columbia, another registered at Barnard, can graduate with similar degrees, having taken many of the same courses. Having never used the advising, health, career, or any other support services at Barnard—and to be honest,having barely used the ones at Columbia either—l can’t speak to whether tangible differences exist between the two. However, I don’t think there are necessary and essential differences between the host of administrative and support services available on both sides of the street. Perhaps differences exist now, but there is no reason they have to. What differences there may be do not deﬁne Barnard or Columbia—they are incidental. If Columbia split its undergraduate support services in half, the ﬁrst half catering to students whose names begin A—L, the second half catering to students whose names begin M-Z, there might be some differences in the quality of one half compared to the other half. However, that is not to say that the two halves will differ in kind. Barnard’s advising system might be in much better shape than Columbia’s, but that difference hardly merits a separate school. While a Barnard— Columbia merger might seem logical, it is more likely to be caused by economic reasons than one of educational philosophy. : I can’t for the life of me ﬁgure out how the social ; life could be so different on the other side of the street.’ . Living in womens-only dormitories could be seen as ; signiﬁcant, but given that Barnard students have the op- ' portunity to live off-campus or in Columbia residence ‘ halls, it is hardly an unshakeable pillar of the Barnard I experience. The fact is that Columbia and Barnard share classrooms, we eat at the same restaurants, go out to the . same bars, and ride the same subway trains. _ l' While a Barnard-Columbia rnerger might seemhlogical, it is more likely to be caused by economic reasons than one of educational philosophy. Barnard is in a rather dire situation—pools are being closed, doubles are being turned into triples, and physical education requirements are being curtailed. Columbia, despite the Manhattanville expansion, will continue to View limited space as its biggest impediment toward further expansion. Especially if they become more acute, Barnard’s dire ﬁnances and Columbia’s demand for space would make a merger mutually beneﬁcial. If and when a merger occurs, I don’t know whether we—that is, Columbia AND Barnard—will lose much aside from the administrative overlap that currently exists. And where does that overlap come from? It comes as a result of the separate history of the two schools, because at one point in time, Columbia didn’t see it ﬁt to accept women. A I So, why isn’t a merger being seriously considered?

608,the MANY SHADES of MODERN ORTHODOX,25 April 2013,
609,Recovering our story,29 April 2013,"one of my inestimably eccentric ' friends ambushed me in JJ’s Place ~ the other night. I was rather curt with l""§.;,3'i 9 her, I’m afraid—l was wrestling through pg?‘ \' the poetry of W. H. Auden, trying to understand what on earth I could write about for my ﬁnal paper. (I really don’t LU§{§»; know why I thought I would be able to E 9 STER concentrate in JJ’s.) One of the brilliant 1 remarks she dropped before she depart- F 0 St 9 1° ed in pursuit of Jamba Juice was “CC the \ doesn’t really tell us anything about i the future. It might be a lot more in- C ore ' teresting if it did.” My initial (silent) reaction was a typical one: Preserve traditional things as they are! They have been done this way for decades, why change them? After all, Literature Humanities just had its 75th birthday. But I was eventually forced to think—-a dangerous pastime, I know. ~ ' What if the Core Curriculum gave us insight into the future as well as into the past? I do love the Core. There is certainly an inescapable beauty, majesty, pathos, and wonder in reading the “Aeneid,” viewing Raphael, and hearing a Gregorian chant. The Core has the power to do more than teach us facts—it can touch our souls, fire our minds, enliven our hearts. I think it even has the potential to make us better men and women. “Crime and Punishment” scalds our sensibilities by portraying injustice in all its horror. Plato’s “Republic” helps us imagine a harmonious society and makes us long for true peace. The Core is great, but it could be much better. There are institutional factors that can be improved, A such as the allocation of funding, and there are changes that we can make to our student culture. An honor code might help. But I think the saddest aspect of studying Contemporary Civilization, the centerpiece of the Core, lies in the history of the masterpieces of Western philosophy themselves. The syllabus starts in the fall with bold attempts to erect a comprehensive worldview. Plato, Aristotle, St. Paul, and St. Augustine certainly went in different directions, but they all believed in Truth—a metanarrative, a cosmic story—that could provide answers for the questions of human life. Even those who were more circumspect in their proposed answers for the Big Questions, such as the author of Ecclesiastes, were confident that answers could be found. That basic commitment to unifying ethics, metaphysics, aesthetics—philosophy in all its glory—held steady throughout centuries of Western intellectual . history. Even when the Greco-Roman world converted to Christianity after witnessing the actions of the martyrs, that approach did not change. The answer to the question “What is a good life?” certainly changedChristianity substituted an ethic of sacrificial love for the Aristotelian ethic of moderation in virtue—but the confidence in the fact that there was an answer remained. After the high point of Christian_consensus in the Middle Ages, that basic belief in Truth began to be questioned. Galileo and C.o.pernicus cha_ll.enged cos— _ mological assumptions, Descartes made the self the G arbiter of truth, and Machiavelli dared to envision secular politics. The Enlightenment accelerated this breakup of a uniﬁed worldview, though many thinkers of the “Age of Reason” did not surrender belief in transcendent truth—they just transcendentalized their visions of Progress. . The real drama came about in the 20th century, and the CC syllabus reﬂects this. Nietzsche, Woolf, Fanon, and Gandhi all work to subvert dominant narratives. ""The horror of two world wars, the slaughters in the name of murderous ideologies from Maoisrn to Nasserism, and the ugliness of Western imperialism seemed compelling evidence that the world was random and meaningless. What grand plan, either of God or of Progress, could account for Auschwitz or the A Armenian Genocide? . We’ve all felt the impact of the breakup of unifying visions of the world and of alienation from meaning. We came of age in the 21st century when we had to be taught, according to the New York Times, “How to Live Without Irony.” Ideologies—-religious or secular, right or left-have been used as means to horrible ends, and our world still struggles to pick up the shattered pieces. We enter CC already’ leery of committing to one transcendent story, and the trajectory of the syllabus helps to reinforce that skepticism. Yet we cannot help wanting to know what the ' future holds, for our own lives and for our society. And there are innumerable competing narratives out there—environmentalists warn of climate catastrophe, Marxists predict the demise of capitalism, and conservatives decry cultural decadence. I think we are right to be wary of abuses ‘of power, so many of which have been committed in the name of Truth. We are right to celebrate reason and the scientiﬁc method, which have contributed so much to human knowledge. But acknowledging all of that should not make us afraid to give voice to our longing for transcendence, our love ' of Goodness and Truth and Beauty, in CC. It was the title of Frantz Fanon’s polemic that reminded me of hope: “The Wretched of the Earth.” The dour phrase brought to mind the ringing finale of the great musical “Les Miserables”: “For the wretched of the earth, there is a ﬂame that never dies. They will live again in freedom in the garden of the Lord, they will walk behind the plowshare, they will put away the sword.” What if there really is a hope for a future world of justice and peace and love and human ﬂourishing? What if we catch glimpses of that eternal bliss every time we experience kindness, hear Gustav Holst’s “The Planets,” or wake to a new sunrise? I want my life to be an engaged witness to that hope.

Having been treated as the unwanted half in a gendercide back home, a racial category to tick off in the American modeling industry, . and somebody who can do it all “because she’s Asian,” it’s comforting to come to a place that, despite its widely ranging perspectives, has principles of acceptance. Girls back home in Taiwan and China are meant to be quiet, meek, and humble—at least in public interactions. ‘ But, bettereyet, those qualities should be a part of one’s ‘ core character. I, unfortunately, embody none of these 1 covetable traits, except perhaps meekness in my great ‘ Taiwanese fear of offending. One of my vivid childhood ‘ memories is not being able to look at a male teacher in grade school whenever I spoke, because I wasn’t used to talking unless I was spoken to, much less directly to men. Here at Columbia, this tendency manifested itself most strongly in my Literature Humanities class, where . class contribution was expected and eXciting—just the American style of participation and discussion that I had looked forward to all my life and would not have the opportunity to experience at a local Chinese school. Yet my ﬁrst few weeks here, Ifelt a mental paralysis in which I couldn’t bring myself to express my ideas, thinking themoffensive or inferior to those of my peers—people meant to be my equals. It wasn’t even a matter of getting comfortable with college dynamics, but a constant struggle to remind myself that as a student at Columbia, I can be in awe of other people’s knowledge and achievements without having to feel inferior and be silenced for the same reasons that I was back home. ~ But, above all, as a Taiwanese girl you’re expected to have it all together, or at least look the part. Even if you’re having a truly awful day, you have to smile. The less 1 somebody is able to tell how off you feel, the more you’re allowed to commend yourself for your success. A not-so-stellar performance will garner you a reprimand from a loved one who truly means best for you, and certainly a judgmental whisper amplifying outward from a nameless mass of people watching you, now placing you under a spotlight for your deviance. The less somebody is able to tell how off you feel, the more you’re allowed to commend yourself for yOlll' SUCCESS. As somebody with idiosyncratic behaviors and inter.— c ests, I once thought to buck, the system through razorblades. Instead of receiving horriﬁed responses, I was rebuked for being inherently weak against pressures that no child should have faced alone. The marks disappeared quickly, but I only healed mentally at Columbia. I shared stories with other Aspies—what those of us who - suffer from Asperger’s syndrome call ourselves——about . my ﬁrst_tell-tale obsessions, and I could stand straighter in our collective refusal to be victimized. No longer does anyone tear apart my poetry when a stray page is found in a homework booklet, or insinuate that I’m unsuitable to be a church student leader because of my penchant for conspicuous denim maxis. ’For somebody unhappy in the restraints of her culture, America is a better place because of its more open, accepting nature—as is expected from a “melting pot” encompassing wide varieties of people. Regarding mental issues or personal decisions, encouragement is always seen as the better response. Here, there have been “Silver Linings Playbook” screenings and marches against sexual violence, and there is just a general willingness to advocate and learn about “taboo” subjects to make them less so. There have been outright attempts to show Columbia students that it’s normal when everything’s not all rightthat you always think everybody else has it all together, ‘ when they don’t, and they think that you do. ' At home, my 3.7 GPA was considered “too low for an Asian,” and my various 6505 on SAT subject tests were deemed not enough to make it into “decent universities” (read: the Ivies). As the girl who wanted to be the unpredictable wildcard, I was relying on what other parents and competitive students had denounced: 11 extracurricular involvements on top of several jobs and internships. In their analysis of the American college admis-j sions process, the traditional ﬁght for grades prevalent in China still won out. For me, I was glad that Columbia looked past grades alone and welcomed me in, telling A me that I was good enough the way that I wanted to be. Never one to ﬁnd self-validation in admissions—l didn’t take the process seriously enough for that—l still found. I hope in coming to a place where whatever decision I make, it will always be my prerogative. While I hold responsibility for my actions, America promises me the agency to do what I desire with myself.

611,"Lit Hum incident, BC cheating scandal come as councils debate honor code",13 May 2013,"BY TRACEY WANG, . ‘CASEY TOLAN, D SAMANTHA COONEY Spectator Senior Staff Writers K A year that saw widespread debate over academic integrity and a proposed honor code was capped off by a high-pro-ﬁle cheating scandal at Barnard and the distribution of revealing information before Friday’s Literature Humanities ﬁnal. Information about the identiﬁcation section on the Lit Hum ﬁnal was leaked by a professor and Widely distributed among ﬁrst-year students before the exam. As a result, the ID section will be excluded from grading. Lit Huniig-ieiptor Ivan Lupic ~ gave his students a handout identifying 10 passages in sections of the books he said were likely to appear on the exam. The handout did not identify the exact passages ultimately used, but every passage on the handout was within a page or two of a passage that appeared on theexam. LLupic gave his students the handout on the last day of class and told them to study the pages surrounding those passages, according to Daniel Friedman, CC ’l6. Friedman was notin Lupic’s class but received a copy of the handout from a friend in the class after the exam. All non-tenured professors teaching Lit Hum must administer the same exam. In an email to all Lit Hum students sent almost two hours after the exam had ended, Lit Hum chair Gareth Williams said that an instructor had released the approximate location of the IDs before the exam, and that students had distributed the information at Orgo Night...- » =ealzly Friday morning. The ID section will be excluded from grading, Williams said. “We have no other choice at this time but to take pragmatic measures to ensure the integrity of the grading,” he said in the email. “We intend to do everything possible to make sure that this does not happen again.”s /V In an email to Spectator, Lupic defended his actions, saying that he “did not disclose any part of the exam to my students.” Lupic noted that while his handout “contained a number of passages from the sections or chapters included in the exam,” it did not include any passages on the exam. “Its purpose was to guide our discussion, not to reveal the content of the exam,” he said. “As my students can testify, our discussion ranged widely and covered entire works; it was in no way conducted in a way that , would provide ready-made exam answers.” ‘ 1 Meanwhile, Major English Texts literature class with:""i2°§l’stud‘éhts, by Margaret Ellsberg——is under review after allegations of widespread cheating. ' V The alleged cheating, which has received national attention, involved students using‘ their phones during exams to look up i answers on the Internet and copyeach other’s work. , Ellsberg, a senior lecturer who has taught at Barnard since 1998 and who teaches the class without teaching assistants, also allowed students to grade each other’s work. A student in the class, who"" asked not to be named, said that her peers often passed the quizzes to friends and added points despite incorrect answers. Ellsberg will not count the reading quizzes toward students’ ﬁnal grades, instead adding an exam that will count for 70 percent of students’ ﬁnal grades on the ﬁrst day of reading week. Students, however, were given the option to pass/D/fail the course in light of the incident. _ _j,_“_l3arnard Dean Avis Hinkson ' iariﬁfﬁinglish department chair Peter Platt administered the ﬁnal ‘exam. Barnard Vice Provost Hilary Linkcq said in a statement that ,“in this particular situation, collegeprocedure was followed in that theprofessor, in consultation with relevant committees and her department chair, discounted ‘quizzes because of a serious concern that academic integrity may have been compromised. In accordance with college policy, therprofessor supplemented the course assessment with a ﬁnal exam.” . T JungHee Hyun, BC ’l3 and outgoing , president of Barnard’s Student Government Association, said that despite news of the Major Texts cheating scandal, she believes in working to preserve the standard that the honor code sets. “I think, as a student government member and as a Barnard student, it’s important to uphold the standards of the honor code. The honor code is something we have to continue to work on and promote as a student body,” she said. The Lit Hum and Major Texts scandals came after ayear during which student council leaders moved forward with a proposal for an academic honor code. Both the Columbia College Student Council and the General Studies Student Council passed the resolution with overwhelming majorities last month. SinceBarnard has had an honor code since 1912, Barnard’s Student Government Association unanimously passed aimodiﬁed version of it. V The Engineering Student Council, however, shocked CCSC members when it voted nearly unanimously to rescind its support for the honor code resolution a week after it had approved it. ‘ ‘ “It was surprising that after all that discussion, that’s when the objections came.” —Steven Castellano, CC ’l3, CCSC academic ajfairs representative The resolution would require students from all four undergraduate schools to recite an honor pledge during the New Student Orientation Program convocation. It would also print an honor code on Columbia blue books and encourage faculty to include the code on syllabi and exams. Tim Qin, SEAS ’l3 and outgoing president of ESC, said the main issue that led members to rescind their votes was the lack of student and administrative input on the proposal. “When the resolution was ﬁrst presented, it was presented in a way that all administrative ofﬁces had been involved,” he said. However, he added, “The V dean of our school had not heard about it until Friday,” three days before the council voted on the matter. Some CCSC members said that ESC’s sudden ﬂip—ﬂop did not make sense. _“Since most administrators agree with the philosophy of the idea, I don’t see that as an obstacle for ESC voicing their support for it,” said outgoing CCSC academic affairs representativeSteven Castellano, CC ’l3, who has spearheaded the proposal. Castellano also questioned why ESC’s objections came at the 11th hour. ‘ “We’ve been talking about it all year,” Castellano said. “It was surprising that after all that discussion, that’s when the objections came.” “I don’t understand Where the surprise [in ESC] is coming from,” Liam Bland, CC ’l5 and CCSC class of 2015 representative, said. “It doesn’t seem to have an origin.” Qin, though, said more student input is needed. “There hasn’t been substantial discussion among students,” he said. “Discussion among council for one year does not equate talking to students.” V C Meanwhile, the other councils are moving ahead with the resolution without ESC’s support. CCSC and GSSC both passednew resolutions without a clause requiring the support of all undergraduate councils. Bland said removing the clause was unfortunate but necessary after ESC’s vote. “We were thinking that there’s no point in having an honor code unless the four of us are all together,” he said. “I think it’s a shame that we have to go back on that and revisit this from another angle. This is a lesser option.” Qin criticized CCSC and GSSC’s decisions to pass new resolutions without the clause. “I think it’s- very telling of the process,” he said. “Instead of trying to pretend that you care about all four councils, you’re just going to remove the clause.” Castellano said the Academic Integrity Task Force, which had been planning the policy’s implementation, will reassess which NSOP events are feasible after the ESC vote. “It would be a shame to call all of that off and let it go to waste, so we’re trying to ﬁgure out what makes sense,” he said. “Obviously, we’re not going to give a four-‘ school pledge united on integrity if the four schools are not united on integrity right now.” i news@columbiaspectatoncomHIS HONOR | Columbia College Student Council academic affairs representative Steven Castellano discusses the honor code proposal-which has been controversial among the councils—at a CCSC meeting."

All Rhea Sen needed was an admissions letter,13 May 2013,"Z 1.1.| cn 111 .'.|'.' n:BY FINN VIGELAND Spectator Senior Staff Writer Rhea Sen started off her August at Columbia as any new student would: going on bus tours around the city, taking photos with new acquaintances, discussing the perks and quirks of each residence hall. The only problem? Rhea Sen doesn’t go to Columbia. Her name, it would turn out, wasn’t even Rhea Sen. Birva Patel, 26, made national headlines when she was arrested on the Morningside Heights campus for criminal trespass in September. She Was brought to administrators’ attention only after her suspicious behavior during the two weeks of orientation programs, during which she aggressively befriended ﬁrstyears and misled them on the subway, but her arrest brought an end to at least a nine-month run posing as a Columbia student. . Rebecca Smith, CC ’l3 and an International Student Orientation Program leader, ﬁrst noticed the woman on Aug. 24. She was eating cereal alone in John Jay Dining Hall and gave the name Rhea Sen. She told Smith that she was registered for the Columbia Outdoor Orientation Program but had missed the program’s departure. Although she lived in Philadelphia, she said, she was born inplndia, so Smith offered to try to register her for ISOP. ’“That’s really nice, but I don’t want to cause any trouble,” Smith recalled her saying. The quiet girl gave Smith her phone number anyway, and Smith was given administrative approval to register her if she could get her UNI. Smith called the number, but no one ever answered. Smith said she didn’t see her again for three days, but in the meantime, Patel—posing as Rhea-went on a city tour and attended an Afropunk festival in Brooklyn, other ISOP leaders said. On her way to the party at the Bronx Zoo that capped off orientation week, Cami Quarta, CC ’l6, and a friend wound up on the subway with Patel. Even though Quarta had been told to take the train to 180th Street, Patel showed her a text message she claimed to be from her orientation leader instructing her to get off at an earlier stop and take a bus. The two heeded Patel’s advice, Winding up far from their intended destination. A helpful police ofﬁcer steered the three of them back on the subway. Quarta said Patel Went with a friend to a Literature Humanities class during the ﬁrst week of school, but when the preceptor arrived, Patel left the room and waited in ~ the hallway until the class was over. On Sept. 5, she sent Quarta two Facebook messages littered with misspellings and dozens of English and Hindi curses. Her time on campus wasnot conﬁned to the ﬁrst few weeks of the fall semester. The day after Spectator broke the news of her ﬁrst arrest, six students reported seeing her at Columbia as early as December 2011, going by her real name and claiming to be a junior studying engineering. “She just had this weird vibe,” said Anna Prouty, BC ’l4, who met Patel at“%Uni Café in April. “I love awkward people——l’m kind of awkwardbut it wasn’t like that. It was, ‘Hi, can I hang out with you?”’ _ Others who interacted with Patel gave similar characterizations of her behavior: She approached them and all but demanded to be friends, and she repeatedly lied about what she was studying and what school she was in. Three students received rambling, sometimes profanity-laced Facebook messages from her. Others saw her on the subway, often lingering on the plat--form as trains came and went. V Patel has appeared in court several times since her arrests, each hearing adjourned for another few months without much progress. One student, who asked not to be named because Patel has her phone number, said she met Patel in March 2012, also at Uni Café. Noticing Patel’_s strong Indian accent and wanting to help the seemingly lonely woman make friends, the student—-a member of the Hindu Students Organization—invited her toChamak, a Pakistani event taking place that evening. Patel and the student exchanged phone numbers, and Patel promised to come to Chamak before backing out. i Patel also promised to go to Tamasha, a South Asian cultural showcase, and she texted the student that she was in Roone Arledge Auditorium during the event. But she later texted that she had lied and “had to go out.” The student grew frustrated that Patel never seemed to follow through despite saying that she wanted to meet more people. Janelle Bracken, Business ’l3, met Patel in February 2012 in the lobby of Uris Hall. Patel ' told Bracken that she was an undergraduate student but had attended Business School happy hours, on Thursdays. Bracken, relaying the encounter to her B-School friends, learned that they had also seen Patel at happy hours, and that Patel had asked them to log her into Uris computers. Patel Facebook-friended Bracken and asked if she wanted to go clubbing, and when Bracken declined, Patel vehemently denied attending the happy hours and cursed Bracken out. Students who interacted with Patel said that while she seemed to know enough details about Columbia to make it plausible that she was a student, she sometimes blanked on basic facts. ' “I said I went to Barnard,and she went, ‘What’s that?’” Prouty said. Patel told the student in the Hindu Students Organization that she Was a junior in Columbia College studying biomedical engineeringa major offered only at the School of Engineering and Applied Science. When Tanay Doctor, SEAS ’l5, asked Patel if she liked working with Andrew Laine, the chair of the department, “she seemed to have no idea who he Was,” Doctor said in an email. Students who met her had different reactions to Patel’s lies. Some felt threatened, while others wrote them offas the behavior of an awkward student. , _ The HSO student grew suspicious of Patel when she gave her email address .as bap666o@barnard.edu, considering Patel had said she went to CC. The student became even more suspicious when an email she sent to that address bounced. “I felt unsafe.» I felt like she was psychotic,” she said.

' A double major in creative writing and psychology, Alanl ‘ said that her previous novels Were, in many ways, written in preparation for this one. Her current novel tells the story of three Bengali sisters who live in the United States with their mother, until their * mother dies and the sisters have - to deal with the aftermath of me grieving process. “It’s sort of a mystery after that,” Alam said. Alam has recently won two writing prizes from Barnard’s English department, both for her prose. Her stories often deal with issues of identity, which Alam has spent much of her time at college exploring and examining. ""‘The most important thing for me is the intersection betweengarts and activism,” she said. “My creative writing is central in my life, and that’s been my path this entire time.” As the outgoing chair of the Asian American Alliance, Alam has largely dedicated her time at Barnard to activism efforts and building alliances among communities of color on campus. “For me, A was such a growing experience, ﬁguring out how we create a pan-Asian community, and how do we express that, and how do we do that politically while still fostering that social aspect,” she said. Alam described herself as an activist and a Woman of color, and words like privilege, class, race, and ally have become ingrained in her vocabulary. Having led multiple Workshops on these issues, she acknowledged that she can often go into lecture mode. In fact, her philosophy on learning and college educationcentered around the inﬂuence of postcolonial history. She said she loves that Barnard’s Nine Ways of Knowing gives her the freedom to choose her classes, and she is grateful that she didn’t go through Columbia’s Core Curriculum. Core classes like Literature Humanities, she‘ said, often highlight works that come from an oppressive history. “Before the colonization of India, there was no English literature. That was not a ﬁeld to go into,” she said. “It was literally just, like, Latin and Greek and sometimes French. The reason why English was created, as a subject, was to teach quote unquote the ‘hedon Indian’ populations about the value of their colonizers’ works.” Alam said working as a Well Woman peer educator has been one of her most valuable experiences at Barnard. The Well Woman office is a “place for when people have questions or need informaﬁon about, like, any health related thing—from stress reduction to sexual health,” she said. A“It really empowers the students there, because We’re peer educators,” she said. “We don’t do advice. We’re sort of like, ‘How would it be best for you to take the materials that you’re given and make your own decision about it?’’’ i - After graduating, Alarn will be a summer clean at the Sadie Nash Leadership Project in Brooklyn, running workshops on social justice for young women of color.

POINTS or-‘ TENSION Since Frontiers became a part of the Core in 2005, it has been a source of constant controversy, with many students criticizing the course both for alienating human-ities-oriented students and for being too cursory to interest scienceoriented students. Students have‘also argued that the course lacks clearly deﬁned goals and fails to instill scientiﬁc habits of mind. Some professors, meanwhile, have said that the course has improved over time, and that old students’ negative reviews have made incoming ﬁrst-years predisposed to dislike Frontiers. The course has been subject totown hall discussions, ‘input from students and faculty, and numerous Spectator editorials—both supportive and critical. , “Our greatest concern, in conducting this review, has been to discover the depth of polarization and the level of strong feelings the course has generated,” the report reads. “Thisconﬂictual attitude is unworthy of us, damaging to our students, and at odds with the values of deliberation and collective purpose at the heart of the core.” Ivana Hughes, the course’s associate director and a chemistry lecturer, believes that the Frontiers faculty has already made improvements to the course over the last few years. ~ “In the early years of tlie course, there was a perceived disconnect between lectures and seminars, in that lectures dealt with specific content, while seminars dealt with the scientiﬁc habits of mind,” Hughes said an interview at the end of the spring semester, before Spectator had obtained a copy of the EPPC report. “What we have done more recently is to make sure that there is better integration between the -two pieces.” . Other revisions to the course have included more challenging homework assignments, assignments related to lecture content, M and the scientiﬁc habits of mind, a term paper assignment that helps students learn to analyze scientiﬁc articles, and a trip to the American Museum of Natural History, which is now mandatory for most sections. Additionally, professors have modiﬁed the activities they do in seminar, making them more challenging to help students build critical reasoning skills and learn to evaluate scientiﬁc evidence. “I think one of the really wonderful things about the seminar environment in our classes is that they’re very student-centered,” Hughes said. ,“Students answer and ‘ ask questions, and they spend time discussing topics in small groups.” Hughes believes that these changes have begun to improve student opinions of the course. “Many of the things that we have done are working,” she said. “We just had our best academic year yet, as judged by student evaluations, by a long shot.” Last fall—the most recent semester for which course evaluations were reviewed in the EPPC ~ report—students gave Frontiers an “overall quality” rating of 3.28, the highest rating the course had ever received. Still, it was signiﬁcantly lower than the “overall quality” ratings typically received by Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, which have ranged between 4.0 and 4.4 over the last few years. . On the whole, Frontiers’ “overall quality” rating has improved over time, from an average of 2.68 between fall 2004 and fall 2008 to an average of 2.95 between spring 2009 and fall 2012. Student rat- ’ ings for “seminar leader effectiveness,” meanwhile, have gone up more consistently, from 3.54 in fall 2004 to 4.33 in fall 2012, and lecturer ratings have generally improved as well. , A full breakdown of the Frontiers course evaluation data appears inAppendix 5 of the EPPC report. “Studentsvalue both the lecture and the seminar component » of the course, and we ﬁnd that they give us very high marks for many speciﬁc items, such as homework assignments, clarity of expectations, integration of lectures and seminars,” Hughes said. MEASURING SUCCESS Frontiers faculty, hoping to measure the success of the changesthey have implemented, administered a survey on basic analytic concepts——including statistics, probability, and graph comprehension—to 966 ﬁrst-years during New Student Orientation Program in the fall of 2012. Students averaged a score of 28 percent on test - l The survey was then administered again, at the end of tlie fall semester, to students who had taken Frontiers. This time, the average grade was 76 percent. Spectator removed acopy of the sLu'vey questions and answers from the EPPC report before publication, because the Frontiers faculty plans toreadminister the survey to students when they are seniors, to test for retention of Frontiers material. L ‘This type of research always has its limitations,” the Frontiers of Science Executive Committee said in an email to ﬁrst-years in March “However, the results with and without FoS are so different that the conclusion is inescapable. The scientiﬁc habits and knowledge that FoS imparts are new to, and effectively learned by, ﬁrst—year students after one semester of in- — tense study.” But statistics professor Andrew Gelman, who has not taught Frontiers and was not part of the committee that prepared the report, wasn’t convinced by that conclusion. While he respected the Frontiers faculty’s effort to measure what students had learned in the course——which, he said, not ~ many professors even attempt—he questioned the survey’s effectiveness in a post on his website last month. Gelrnan noted that students took the survey during their ﬁnal exam, meaningboth that they had spent time studying and that they were allowed to use their exam cheat sheets. “It certainly looks like great evidence, but the conditions under which the experiment is done can . have large effects,” Gelman said in an interview. Gelman recommended adding more questions to the survey and , using an outside evaluator to create and moderate it in the future. “The point, especially for a Core class, is to give students_neW ways of thinking,” Gelman said. “You wouldn’t want the instructors to know what was on the exam, so then you wouldn’t have to worry that they would teach to it.” “It’s better than doing nothing,” he added. “But I think you really have to be careful about claiming that the students in this program have been a stunning success.” FRONTIERS’ FUTURE Whatever changes come to Frontiers, the EPPC and the Frontiers faculty agree that science should continue to play an important role in the Core Curriculum. “We feel strongly that for students to be exposed to this is just as important as them being exposed to literature, philosophy, art, or music,” Hughes said. “The critical reasoning skills they learn in Frontiers will serve them well in their lives and future careers.” The EPPC, too, emphasized the importance ofkeeping Frontiers in the Core—as long as it is structured more like other Core classes. “So long as Columbia College preserves a distinct core curricu- 1 lum of seminar courses, we should r strive to include a similarly structured science course that core,” the report says. ‘ It remains unclear just how Frontiers will be reworked, as the EPPC’s recommendations will now reviewed by Valentini, the Committee on Instruction, T the Committee on Science Instruction, and the Committee on the Core. The EPPC report advises Valentini to form a working group, made up of Frontiers faculty and faculty from other science departments, which would reﬁne Frontiers and solidify its place in the Core. : “As faculty consider how to make the course more ‘core-like,’ they should also bear in mind the relationship of any speciﬁc sem-inar-based science core course to the science requirement as a whole, asking which aspects of the goals of the science requirement are met through lecture courses and which might be best achieved through a course taught in the seminar format central to the Columbia core experience,” the committee wrote: . samantha.cooney 1 @columbiaspectator.com T"
615,Committee formed to revamp Frontiers,30 September 2013,"BY SAMANTHA COONEY _ Spectator Senior Staff Writer l . Say goodbye to Frontiers of Science—a new science course for ‘the Core"" Curriculum is officially in the works. A 17-member committee of faculty and students will begin the process of designing the new course on Monday. Columbia College V Dean James Valentini announced the committee, which will be co—chaired by environmental science professor Peter deMenocal and philosophy’professor Philip Kitcher, on his blog on Friday. ‘ The Educational Policy and Planning Committee spent last year evaluating Frontiers. In its i extensive report, published by Spectator in June, the EPPC advised major revisions for the course, including an end to the lecture portion and a standard- — ized curriculum for the discussion seminars. _ , “The charter of that committee was to see if Frontiers of Science should becontin- ’ ued in its current form, or if we should do something else,” Valentini said in an interview on Friday. “And it said we should do something else.” The. new committee had its first introductory meeting last week. Astronomy profes- . sor Jacqueline van Gorkom,_ a former seminar instructor from Frontiers, is the onlycommittee member to have also served on the EPPC’s review committee. , The committee also includes Gareth Williams, the chair of the classics department and the former chair of Literature Humanities; Martin Chalfie, a biology professor; Donald Hood, a psychology professor; Jenny Davidson, a professor of English literature; Violet Nieves, CC ’l5; Ari Schuman, CC ’l5; Emma Dell, GSAS ’l5; and Cliff Massey, CC ’lO. While the committee will have access to the EPPC’s recommendations, Valentini said that it doesn’t have to start withFrontiers as a base—it can design an entirely new course. “It’s starting without predicate,” Valentini said. “It can design a course of any kind, in any way, designed at achieving our objectives.” ’ Those objectives include better integrating the course with the rest. of the Core‘ Curriculum, particularly Contemporary Civilization, and finding a structure that is more engaging to students. “I don’t Want it to stand apart,” Valentini said. “Being conceptually integratedwith ' the rest of the Core is a really important factor to me.” samantha.cooney » @columbiaspectator.com l"
616,Thinking outside the rectangle,28 October 2013,"There was a day not so long ago, ' longing for L.A., that I decided to go to the beach. This was just as preparation for the ﬁrst round of the semester’s midterms was ramping up, and I was pretty sure I had at least a couple of books I needed to read before the end L3,‘: AS _ of the day for Literature Humanities. M AC H A Nevertheless, I found a few people will— ' ' ' ‘ ing to take the Q train to its ﬁnal stop ’ M3C ha (an endeavor in itself), grabbed a pair M an of sunglasses, and headed for sunny Coney Island. v I look back on that impulsive excursion and I i wonder Where exactly the impetus for the trip came from. The weather that day was mildly warm at best and the beach lining the edge of Coney Island was probably going to look likevarun-down sandbox in comparison to its more glamorous counterparts on the West Coast (spoiler alert, it did). Even during free days, class work will take precedent—if there’s s enough of it waiting to be ﬁnished. I think I’ve found an answer: the underlying desire to escape an atmosphere demanding seriousness and strict focus on school. Now that midterms are in full swing, the general air of rigidity that wafts a few feet in the air above the brick and cobblestone walkways of campus is even more detectable. It’s the expected result of a workload that is incredibly rigorous (reaffirmed by our number one ranking in The Daily_ Beast’s “20 Most Rigorous Colleges”). , The norm of austerity is clearer whenever I ask _ others about their own college. When prompted about what distinguishes their school from Columbia, most students respond matter-of-factly, “Well, it’s a lot more chill.” Taking that into account, I almost feel compelled to question an environment that is conducive to prioritizing the information and work administered in the classroom above all else. One might think that thenagging curiosities that are offered in endless supply by New York can be satisfied during the weekend, but I’ve met one too many older students wishing they had spent more time during their first year exploring the city. More proof that even during free days, class work will take precedent—if there’s enough of it waiting to be finished. But what exactly are the pluses of getting off campus and exploring the many facets of New York? Something about the act of simply seeing what is out there has to hold some importance. I would never ’ have really known how filthy the water that laps the Coney Island beach really was without taking a plunge into the waves. Or that the Cyclone costs a» it whopping nine bucks per ride. Go figure. On a more serious note, there are those that support the idea of constructing an education entirely away from the boundaries of institutionalized schooling. Walter Kim, a graduate of Princeton, describes a cynical view of the American education system in his memoir, “Lost in the Meritocracy.” In the work, Kirn comments on his journey from one of the worst public schools in Minnesota to Princeton: “I’d been amassing momentum my whole life, entering spelling bees, running my mouth in mock United Nations, and I knew only one direction: forward learning was secondary, promotion was primary.” ‘ With that, Kirn exposes an interesting paradigm in the progression from high school to college. Kirn claims that in the process of working toward a future goal, we adopt “tactics” that are meant to maximize our appeal on paper. And after all, that’s how Columbia, as with any other school, decided who to let in and who to reject. The consequence of strategizing as opposed to learning in the moment is that we may find ourselves lacking a solid educational foundation. Though this does not apply to everyone, I myself regret skimping . on classes senior year to practice standardized testing tricks. That’s why—depending on how you actually define education—letting yourself be consumed . by rankings and numbers can take away not only from learning in the classroom but also the learning that occurs from stepping out and seeing, experiencing, and wondering. . Outside Columbia’s bubble, statistics fall away and general mind sets disperse. We should get outside of the firm rectangle of campus to set out for random destinations as much as possible. The irregular shapes and contours of external life are a series of endless combinations and contain endless opportunities for inquiry. _ Lucas Macha is a Columbia College first-year.

617,Pushing the frontier,29 October 2013,"BY ELORA LOPEZ Columbia College Dean James Valentini’s committee to revamp Frontiers of Science is meeting and assessing the Educational Policy and Planning Committee’s exhaustive report, which was ﬁled in April‘2ol3. It concluded that Frontiers ought to be changed into a more Core-like component of the Core Curriculum. Although Frontiers, like many introductory science classes, has fallen short of its mission to inspire non-science students to appreciate science, its key objectives remain valuable, and the committee ought to incorporate those values when designing a new course. Science has a serious public relations problem in general, so it comes as no surprise that manystudents hold Frontiers in contempt. Evidence of the problem includes the dismal state of math and science education in American K-12 schools, and politicians’ frequent attempts to cut funding for national science programs. Attitudes toward science range from apathetic to fearful to hostile. These attitudes are not unfounded. Schools across the country condition students who do not immediately understand a math or science concept to believe that they are “bad at science,” even if they are perfectly capable of reasoning through complex philosophical arguments or drafting a thoughtful, reasoned literary critique. Science is viewed as an entirely different pedagogical entity. As a result, many non-science students approach Frontiers convinced that they will gain nothing from the experience, or worse, be made to look stupid in front of their peers. Given these greater systemic problems, the challenges that any science class designed for everyone, from the student whose last math class was Algebra I in ninth grade to the student who co-authored a “Nature” paper beforereceiving a high school diploma, must contend with are numerous and enormous. C Some posit that it cannot be done, that the idea of a Core science class should be abandoned in favor of a tiered system that teaches students based on their previous science background. Never mind that we do not segregate Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, they say. Science is different. - Thenew Core science class should not neglect the importance of quantltatlve reasoning. For the sake of science education at every educational level, I argue that we should reject that assumption. I enrolled at Columbia because I wanted to explore literature, philosophy, and the arts through the Core while still getting an excellent science education. It is disheartening that we have yet to ﬁnd a solution that will do the same for my non-scientiﬁc peers: give them an extraordinary taste of the fascinating questions that scientists explore, even if they have no interest in science careers themselves. The EPPC recommends we do this by discarding Frontiers’ lectures in favor of a twice-Weekly seminar. By shifting Frontiers from a lecture-and-content-based class to a reading-and-discussion—based one, We could engage more non-science students in the Wonders and mysteries that science probes. A seminar would promote discussion and inquiry that would stimulate and challenge even those who took every Advanced Placement science class the College Board offers. More focus would be placed on primary literature and philosophical examination. If students were assigned readings that they would have to discuss in class,just as they are in other Core courses, then they could be exposed to both foundational texts and ideas, such as a well-written popular science paper that summarizes the discovery and history of gravity, evolution, or the Big Bang, as well a corresponding recent study that highlights contemporary work in a peer—revieWed journal. 4 ' Even with a more philosophical bent, the new Core sci- \ ence class should not neglect the importance of quantitative reasoning. Back-of-the-envelope calculations should stay since they require logic and a bit of thought, which are both useful to anyone no matter what a student may study after the ﬁrst year. So, too, should the lesson that compares “scientiﬁc journalism” to actual scientiﬁc papers. Too many of my friends still post links to faux science articles for me to be satisﬁed with the state of the public’s understanding of what constitutes scientiﬁc literature. j Frontiers’ designers created the class with several valu-N able objectives in mind. One was to expose students to con-. temporary research, the “frontiers” of modern science. This s is not commended often enough. The second was to provide basic training in skills like estimation and interpretation of data. Although many students do not like this part, quantitative and reasoning skills are practical and necessary. They should be a component of any new science Core, even if it takes a different form from the current one. Frontiers has yet to achieve the third and potentially most revolutionary aim: to provide a single, uniform science course that would inspire and cohere with the rest of the Core Curriculum. A seminar science course, if crafted thoughtfully, could do just that. The status quo in science education has not succeeded in producing a scientiﬁcally literate or appreciative population. _lt is time for a bold new innovation——dare I say a new “frontier” in science education? _ i The author is a Columbia College junior majoring in ecology, evolution and environmental biology."

It’s a question whose answer comes with a lot of hard truths, and one that the 50 percent of undergraduates on ﬁnancial - aid probably ask themselves every year. Given that Columbia estimated the cost of attendance at $64,144 this year, _ the fact that students have a hard time ﬁguring out ways to pay for a Columbia education isn’t a foreign concept for anyone, not even for those who can pay full price. The fact that half of the undergraduate population at Columbia re- , ceives some sort of ﬁnancial aid is telling about its socioeconomic composition. Part of my decision to attend was based on the ﬁnancial aid, which, though almost fully covering the $46,846 tuition, leaves some tuition, and all other expenses and fees, to be paid for by loans and student employment. Though Columbia is doing as well as or better than other Ivy League schools in terms of the absolute number of students on ﬁnancial aid, the number of ﬁrst—generation college students it admits, and the number of undergraduates receiving Federal Pell Grants, all of these measures are only a first step toward enacting one of the goals of institutions of higher learning: acting as social equalizers. . , “I think on the numbers, We do well in comparison to our peers, but we don’t do well enough,” says Roosevelt Montas, a 1995 graduate of Columbia College who also holds a Columbia master’s degree and Ph.D. , and is the director of the Center for the Core Curriculum. “And I think that Columbia is caught in the same national trends that are transforming colleges from ladders of social ascent, from mechanisms of equalizing income and society, into mechanisms of reinforcing privilege and reinforcing inequality.” Schools also face a challenge in deciding how to recruit students from ~ low—income backgrounds. These students tend to face what Montas characterizes as a problem of access. “One could say that the main barrier is information—access to information,” Montas says. “That is, students don’t know what the schools are and how to go about applying to the schools in an effective way. So with information comes mentorship; it’s also college counseling, it’s also test preparation.” 'Facing these issues, as well as the limitations of Columbia’s endowment'-not insubstantial at $8.2 billion, but smaller than Harvard’s ($32.7 billion) or Yale’s - ($20.8 billion), both of which saw returns above 10 percent this year——the offices of ""admissions and ﬁnancial aid must choose carefully between accepting students from socioeconomic backgrounds on both ends of the spectrum. ’ “If colleges accept more students who can pay full price—whether they be international or domestic~then that means they can accept more people who can pay very little because one group subsidizes the other,” Montas says. “So it’s a really tricky balance that the admissions and financial aid people have to strike. ' Admitting people who can pay the whole .thing isn’t necessarily bad for socioeconomic diversity, but it can be.” Ensuring that its students are as socioeconomically diverse as possible will \ be one of Columbia’s most formidable challenges in the coming years. But with socioeconomic diversity comes a cost: the need to make certain that students from under—resourced backgrounds are folded into the student body. A Solid Foundation ~ , In an Oct. 16 ranking of American colleges and universities, U.S. News &. World Report named Columbia the third—best university, and the top private institution, interms of the percentage of undergraduates receiving Pell Grants, according to data from the 2011-2012 academic year. The grants are typically awarded to stu—dents whose family income is in the lowest economic quartile, and as such are used to measure the amount of low—income students at a school. With 30 percent of its undergraduates—including the School of General Studies——receiving Pell Grants, Columbia also outstrips the rest of the Ivy League with regard to the number of undergraduates receiving federal funds to pay for college. Only Harvard (20 percent) and Cornell (18 percent) make the top 10 in the ranking, and Princeton ranks 23rd, with only 12 percent of its students benefitting from Pell Grants. Not including GS, 17 percent of undergraduates receive Pell Grants, which only provide about $5,500 per semester for up to 12 semesters. That’s where school—provided ﬁnancial aid comes in. And because Columbia’s admissions andfinancial aid processes for students at the traditional undergraduate schools, including Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, are separated from those of Barnard and GS, the re—V mainder of this piece Will focus on these issues within CC and SEAS. For domestic students, the admissions process for Columbia’s undergraduate schools is need—blind. (Need is factored into the process for international students, who are not eligible for U.S. grants.)Ac—cording to Jessica Marinaccio, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid for Columbia College and . the School of Engineering and Applied Science, 50 percent of undergraduate students in Columbia College and SEAS receive some sort of financial aid, with the median income of recipients at $87,124. In addition, parents with income and assets that amount to less than $60,000 a year aren’t expected to contribute money toward their child’s education, and the financial aid website says that students coming from these financial _ backgrounds “are expected to borrow $0 to attend Columbia.” Taken at face value, these efforts to make a Columbia education affordable are substantial. But in a certain sense, they are semantic tricks that gloss over the debt that bedecks many stu— A dents like their caps and gowns when they finally march onto Low Plaza at the end of their college career, and that hangs over their parents’ heads as they sit in the stands on South Lawn. The Reality Even if a student doesn’t qualify for Pell Grants—as 70 percent of undergraduates don’t—the government is usually the first lender to which families turn to bridge the gap between grants and the cost of Columbia. This is also where ‘ the tricky semantics of not expecting students to borrow any money comes in. Federal Stafford Loans allow both students and parents to borrow money at low interest rates to pay for school. The «catch? Students claimed as dependents by their parents can only borrow up to $5,500 their first year, $6,500 their second year, and $7,500 in subsequent years if their parents also qualify for loans. Qualified parents, however, can borrow up to the cost of their child’s tuition less any other financial aid from the government every year, putting . a larger burden of debt on them, if they choose to accept it. And even if a family makes less than $60,000 a year, loans may still be necessary, even though Columbia does not expect that parents contribute from their income. 1 At the end pf 2011, Spectator reported that student indebtedness at Columbia has been decreasing for years; the average federal student debt was at almost $9,000 for the class of 2010. However, that number doesn’t take into account the debt that parents take on. . . Eric Donahue, a Columbia College junior, receives financial aid that doesn’t cover the entire amount needed to fund a Columbia education. He applied to - six Ivy League schools, wasaccepted to Cornell and Columbia, and decided that the financial aid offered to him by Columbia was a better deal. “Cornell was the same offer as Columbia, except with about $20,000 more in loans per year, so that was never an option,” Donahue says. “I Went to Columbia because I got waitlisted at all the other schools and the other ones I got into had really bad financial aid.”For Donahue, choosing Columbia was about following the money, especially since his parents weren’t able to take out loans to help him pay for school. “I was either going to go to Columbia or community college—l only knew I could come the week of NSOP because they took so long to give me an appeal, ” he says. “I asked for an appeal for financial aid and got a bigger grant, because otherwise I would be ; taking out about 21 grand a year, and now it’s down to about 16 a year. So I’m going to graduate with 70 ' grand in loans, which is about $6OO to $7OO a month to pay back, but it’s doable and I think it’s worth it in the end.” ' Along with most financial aid packages comes the expectation of either student employment orWork— study—in Which the government pays part . of the student employee’s salary. In most cases, the money earned from either of these is used to cover day—to—day expenses and can sometimes limit extracurricular activities in which a student would otherwise participate. » Donahue, who was one of the writers of the 119th Varsity Show and Willwrite this year’s as Well, said that the time commitment for his involvement precluded him from getting an internship. As a solution, he was paid $6O a week to put up flyers for a writing tutor. ‘ C “I Would spend $5 on the Metro Card—from my s6o—a—Weel§ job from this guy—sss on groceries at Trader Joe’s and have no money to go out.” Though Donahue identifies himself as rrliddle—class, his experience isn’t unique. The challenge of student employment-.—and its impact on students’ daily IIV€S-—IS something with which many students who receive financial-aid are familiar. Haylin Belay and Natalie Moore, both Columbia College juniors, Work part—time to help cover daily expenses. Belay decided to spearhead an effort last spring to begin a Special Interest Community for students work-ing through college, which was dubbed the Student Employee Community Space. The idea behind SECS was to create a place for students such as Moore to “talk to each other” and to create “a space for students to learn from each other and help each other out, ” Belay says. It would also foster a community that Belay feels the University lacks. “There’s no support system in place that acknowledges that working 10 to 15 hours ‘ a week makes it harder to go to school, ” Belay says. SECS was ultimately not awarded University housing. Though Moore’s family makes less than $60,000 per year and there isn’t an expected contribution 0 from her parents, she still works to cover her living expenses, the biggest of which is food. a “Past freshman year, the regular financial aid package stopped giving me enough money ‘to actually pay for food,” she says. “They gave me a good chunk of money as a grocery stipend sophomore year because I opted out of the meal plan process, but it wasn’t enough to buy a meal plan. lt ended up being, like, $l5 a week, which is not really manageable, especially when you consider the things you can get in bulk for that cheap involve a lot of cooking and I didn’t have a kitchen or time to cook.” ’ And though Moore isn’t graduating with more than $1,500 in loans (which she took out for a required dig for her archaeology major), Belaywhose parents don’t provide funding for her education—is taking out loans to bridge the gap. I “If I can haggle the same way I’ve been hag—' gling for the past few semesters, I’ll probably graduate with $35,000 or less [in debt],” she says, “which, in the scheme of student loan debt sounds like nothing, but compared to what I thought I was going to have coming to Columbia, which is notoriously need—blind—l thought I was going to graduate with zero or very close to zero,‘ and the peculiarities of my situation have made it _ not so.” - I . Which isn’t to say that financial aid hasn’t been helpful——Belay says that administrators “have done their best to work around my weird situation and increase my grant size in any way they can” ——but there is more work to be done. These are the problems that people coming from lower and middle socioeconomic groups face once they’ve been admitted to Columbia, to say noth— . ing of what it takes to be admitted in the first place. “What we look at with Pell Grants and college enrollments, that’s the end of the process,” says Roger Lehecka, a 1967 graduate of Columbia College, former dean of students, and co—founder of Columbia’s Double Discovery Center, which provides tutoring , and college mentorship to first— generation college- ,_- bound students. I The bigger problem that confronts low—income students—especially those who are capable of excelling at a selective school—is understanding and completing the process of applying to college. The Access Issue For the past five summers, Montas has taught high school students involved with the Double Discovery Center. His course, Freedom and Citizenship, intro ~a duces students to Core texts and functions much like Contemporary Civilization and literature Humanities. _ Columbia students (including this writer) who enroll in Montas’ fall seminar of the same name are as-signed as college mentors to the students he taught over the summer. For many of these high school ‘ students ,’ the mentorship they receive at DDC constitutes some of their only supportwhen looking at possibilities after high school. Though not all of the students who go through DDC come from lowincome backgrounds, those who do are in a tough position when it comes to applying for college. “There’s a whole support structure that gets people into places like Columbia that these kids don’t have,” Montas says, citing a dearth of effective college counselors as a prime example. Indeed, the issue of access is one that has been facing students for generations; Lehecka founded the Double Discovery Center at a time when he saw a great need for helping qualified students from lowincome backgrounds learn about college~and how to go about applying to it. Almost 50 years after its founding, DDC is still around and “there’s as much of a need for it now as there was then,” Lehecka says. One of the problems, he says, is that “a lower percentage of low-income students with high test scores apply to good colleges than high—income students with high test scores. ” This issue, which originates from various sources, including the lack of good mentors that Montas discusses, culminates - in a disparity between applications from high~ income, high—achieving students and low—income, high achieving students. “It’s not that colleges are discriminating against those low—income kids, but they also don’t find them, the information isn’t there, they don’t apply,” Lehecka, who teaches a seminar on equity in higher education, says. . One of the most comprehensive studies done on this subject was released by the Brookings Institution in March. In the study, Caroline Hoxby, an economics professor at Stanford, and Christopher Avery, a professor of public policy and management at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, shed light on what keeps able students from low—income backgrounds from applying to competitive colleges. The study quantifies what experience suggests: While there isn’t a dearth of students who are qualified to attend schools like _ Columbia and who also come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, these students still don’t apply to selective schools in the same numbers that their ‘equally capable, more well—off counterparts do. The study adds that for every low—income applicant, there are from eight to 15 high—achieving, high— T income students who apply. ’ But the underrepresentation of capable lowincome students is only a symptom of an underlying condition—namely that “the vast majority of high—achieving, low—income students do not apply to any selective college,” according to the study. _ a “Not only are we doing a terrible job in prepar~ ing those students to apply to competitive colleges, ” Montas says, “but even the ones that break through we’ re not reachingthem. They are either not applying to college, or going to schools C that are far lower on the selectivity scales than they could be admitted to, and that’s just tragic.” And for those who get in, there’s a return to the "" issue of affordability. “A lot of them have a tremendous aversion to debt this just generalizes across low—income people,” Montas says. _ This struggle is especially evident among firstgeneration college students, a group that tends to overlap with low—income students.First in the Family A According to Alex Espaﬁa, senior assistant dean of student advising and director of first— generation scholars, one of the biggest issues for flrst generation college students is that their parents often do not understand the college process. On Oct. 24, in the first of several brunches hosted for flrst generation students at the apartment of Monique Rinere, dean of advising, Espaﬁa says it was interesting to hear about flrst—gen—eration students’ backgrounds and their experiences applying to college in a group setting. ' “The stories from students varied from some parents who were very hands—off because they didn’t know What the collegeexperience Was like, so they just let their son or daughter figure things out on their own,” Espaﬁa says, “to other students whose parents were involved in the college process in thatthey wanted to make sure that their son or daughter went to college. But then cost was an issue.” For many first— generation students, as for lowincome students, the difficulty of ﬁguring out the college application process is paramount—a maze that is, sans a DDC—‘like program, often left to students to navigate alone. In situations such as this one, having a E mentor.can be key. ‘ , V A ‘ ‘ “We’ve learned, with flrst generation college ~ l M students, those who have an adult mentor who’-scbeen through the process tend to be a lot more successful,” Espaﬁa says. “So connecting these students vvith a _ mentor who has gone through the college experience ' does Wonders for that student because nowthey. have somebody to talk to who can help them.” For Donahue, who is a ﬁrst—generation college‘-' is . student, it was a lonely process. a _ “My college counselors were kind of like fairies, . . ... . so they didn’t really exist in my life,” he says. “I was i ' ‘ just Googling ‘How to get good financial aid’ and then I started reading about it and I was really gung ho ’ because I saw that the Ivy League had this need—based\ policy, and they didn’t have scholarships.” , Even once they’re on campus, first— generation students face other difflculties—both academic L and social.

619,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR,26 November 2013,"To the editor: "" Your staff editorial (“Where’s the Core in Global Core?” Nov. 20) offers a much-needed critique of current Core requirements, which are more global in the sense of being widely spread out than anything like the original core: Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities. Everything you say about the courses that still have a common core to them is correct, but I fear that students will have difficulty sorting out the dizzying array of choices put before ‘them. I suggest that they consider the courses specifically designed on the model of CC and Literature ' Humanities: Asian Humanities and Asian Civilization.

620,Science of humanities,4 February 2014,"Last September, the formation of a committee overseeing a Wholesale revision of the Frontiers of Science formula was met with applause from students. But it remains to be seen i ‘ whetheror not this new pedagogical experiment can resolve underlying is- V KEV-EN E i sues between science and the Core. ' The current proposal to reformulate Pl-ilnate’s Frontiers as a dialogue‘-based, seminarstyle affair—geared toward propagat- Per"" Spec"" ing the general discussion of science . tive instead of prodding students with a . A dabbler’s—digest of topical progress—is a step in the right direction. It has been made painfully clear that quarter- _ semester injections of concentrated knowledge do more i harm than good. Science delivered in that form simply Won’t stick. Instead, it creates in students a staggering sense of pointlessness and a bolstered apathy toward information that already seems to be irrelevant. The key word here is irrelevant. Students ask, “What’s the point?” and ‘-‘Why should this stuff matter to me?” Why indeed did the shaky Frontiers of Science sci- »it ence experiment, over the course of its dubious 10-year lease, appear to fail so completely in generating a sentiment of urgency and saliency toward its source material? 1 One possibility is that complications result from inserting empirical disciplines into a historically non’-empiri-. cal—arguably ‘anti-empirical—system of instruction. But the essential problem looks something like -this: As itstands, the Core treats the world of descriptive.science (its discoveries, its process) as discrete from the traditionally prescriptive discussions which ground all” liberal arts educat_ion—discussions on identity, on social Q universals, on Where our ethics come from, on goodness and justice, on (dare I say it?) human nature. ; Yet here sits the science requirement, with its packaged factoids and ground-level acumen, and over there goes the collective mass of everything else that mattersin a humanities-centric curriculum. It is trivially easy to see how courses like Contemporary Civilization and ‘ Literature Humanities press students to grapple with the bigger questions of human experience. The same cannot be said with regard to existing implementations of sci~ ence in the Core, which do little in the way of contributing to the reﬂective mission. T . Author, philosopher, and neuroscientist Sam Harris, ' drawing from David Hume,‘ describes this partition, ' which prevails in both academic and decidedly nonacademic discourse, as “the facts—values divide.” While science can tell us what “is,” itfhas nothing to say with . regard to how we “,ought” to behave. So long as the false dichotomy is upheld, no reiteration of the Frontiers ‘ manifesto will be taken seriously enough to survive the decade. ' . . _ Biological perspectives are still cursory, if not outright expendable, in the existing discourse on larger human questions. a ' What the Core desperately needs is a space in which science and philosophy can experience some sort of ‘ give and take, and where insights afforded by scientiﬁc : progress can be used to inform, update, or revitalize the very old and very tired conversations traditionally pre- , sided over by philosophers. The necessity for this kind of discourse will only grow more pressing as the science of human experience becomes increasingly robust. Biology, psychology, and philosophy areconverging rapidly in a , growing cluster of hybrid disciplinesécollectively touted g as the new sciences of human nature—,—poised to provide elegant and experimentally reprod/ucible answers to‘ questions that used to be outsidethe reach of empirical understanding. - . , That said, the ﬁrst strides in formulating a scientiﬁcally enriched Core—or, at the very least, a Core thatacknowledges and engages with the sciences—need to be taken in classrooms where the identity, project, and mission of the traditional curriculum are already fully realized. Our token philosophy course, Contemporary ‘Civilization, presents itself as a good starting point. _ There are inklings, here, of what could be. After i the more celebrated members of the Contemporary Civilization old guard throw themselves at the question of human nature—with solutions ranging from cartoonishly optimistic (Locke) to deliciously perverse (every mustachioed German)—-we reach Charles Darwin, who gently lays down the suggestion that social traits and ethical sentiments might be the product of the same ' natural forces that gave us bpposable thumbs and big craniums. ‘ ' = . - ° The respectful retentionof “The Descent of Man”. and “The Origin of Species” on the hallowed CC shortlist is a pleasant gesture and a reason for a measured optimism. But by no means does it signify a ‘successful integration of our discourse on ethics and human nature with our , discourse on human biology. I recall my section spending many an hour dissecting the weirdmysticisms of . Hegel, the ‘warped and suspicious psycho-pornography of Freud, the comical unpleasantness of Nietzsche, and then proceeding to skip Darwin entirely. Obviously this omission was the consequence of a very crammed syl- -~ labus, not a conscious effort on the part of my instructor . to _disenfranchise the wisdoms of scientiﬁcally—informed naturalism, but there’s -a sad point to be taken here all the same. Biological (and, more broadly, scientiﬁc) perspectives are still cursory, if not outright expendable, in the V existing discourse on larger human questions. This is, in effect, the root of the problem. Unless the ' new Frontiers manages to traverse the divide between descriptive and prescriptive realms of dialogue, the corn- , mittees in charge of its construction might just be digging a deeper ditch for the dying prospect ofa scientiﬁcally engaged Core curriculum. _ .

621,On not knowing Greek (or Catalan or Swahili),7 February 2014,"BY EMILY HAYMAN , A smart person once told me that every dissertation is a sort of autobiography, and here’s mine: I am atoning for having grown up monolingual. Due to the usual rea-sons——ﬁrst-generation grandparents who _ were all too eager to bury their Italian and Yiddish under American English—l didn’t have the good fortune of automatically having a complete familiarity with another language. To my younger self, knowing another language seemed like AFTER having access to a secret code, something OFFICE HOURS that could unlock the thoughts and feelings that were going on inside another person’s head, a magic‘ key to the unbridgeable, seemingly miraculous fact that other people think differently. ’ I was determined to make up for this iniquity. But here’s ' what I found out: Learning a language is hard. What they don’t tell you in Intermediate German I is that when you Wake up in Freiburg, j et-lagged and woozy, to ﬁnd your . eight German roommates sitting around the kitchen table, it is almost physically painful to muster up a convincing ~“Morgen!”.and ask if you can make some toast. Even as you become more adept and comfortable in a language, there are still days when the words feel slippery and unreachable, when it feels like you are doomed to the undesired . fate of American monolingualism. . _ Still, it does get better, and the small triumphs of communication that we often take for granted in our mother tongue come to seem like miracles of interpersonal con- . nection in a foreign language. All of a sudden, understanding a pun, rap lyric, or late-night conversation about the vicissitudes of Love Actually (for god’s sake, Laura Linney, turn off your phone!) represents a symbolic, redemptive space in which people and cultures really meet, where we surrender our own terms and slip into someone else’s linguistic shoes. This may sound like an advertisement for study abroad (and, in part, it is), but I actually want to make the case not just for linguistic immersion and mastery, but also for the delight and wonder of messing around amateurishly in lan- , . guages where you don’t belong. I had the leisure to learn German pretty well, but rve‘ spent much more time picking _ l up bits and pieces of a variety of other tongues, with rang- ? ing proﬁciency. Would I love to learn these languages with I native ﬂuency? Of course! But life is short, and sometimes the best solution is just to play. Indeed, a few words or phrases in another language can unlock another world. It’s a real—life “abracadabra”: All of sudden, the people you encounter seem a little bit more open, approachable, friendly. A few numbers and a . strong “yes” or “no” (and “thank you”) is enough to bargain in any market. A bit more vocab will serve to strike up a conversation with a hotel concierge or taxi driver (myfavorite captive audience)‘. With world enough and time, it would be wonderful to meet these local interlocutors with full ﬂuency, but even a few words are enough to draw us closer to each other, to erode the barrier between different minds. There are no downsides as long as you’re willing to laugh at an occasional malapropism or to eat up when you accidentally order “andouillette” (offal sausage) with the assumption that it’s just a diminutive version of New Orleans’ “andouille.” And the beneﬁts are manifold: new : camaraderies and friendships, an increasingly wide per- . spective on the world, and most of all, an intimate view of exactly how words work to bring us together. ' As 'l’ve come to pick up more foreign fragments and , (semi-)ﬂuencies, I’ve found that even more rewarding than my own linguistic breakthroughs is the realization that I’m surrounded by people who possess different, often fuller l acquaintances with the many languages of which I have little or (more likely) no knowledge. This is particularly true at Columbia, where something like 20 percent of the . student population is international, many have grown up in multilingual homes, and still more are (like me) striving to shed their American monolingualism once and for all. I’ll never be able to speak every language, but the next best thing is to surround myself with people whose languages ‘I offer them perspectives and ideas that I might never en—counter in my own, small corner of the linguistic world. ‘ ' I’ll end, then, with one of the most gratifying experiences of my short career in teaching, and a perfect indication, in my mind, of the sort of intellectual crescendo to be found in an encounter between tongues. On the ﬁnal day of Literature Humanities in 2013, we read “The Waste Land,” i and, like a conductor in a symphony, I pointed to different students in the classroom to read aloud the poem’s ﬁnal, multilingual explosion: A, whose mom is Italian: “Poi s’ascose nelfoco che gli aﬁina” ‘ A B, who studied Latin in high school: “Quandoﬁam ceu chelidon—O swallow swallow” - C, who is considering a French minor: “Le Prince dﬁquitaine 81 la tour abolie” i A D, American: “These fragments I have shored against my ruins” E, who grew up in London: “Why then Ile ﬁt you. _ Hieronyr_no’s mad againe.” . F, who is taking Beginner Sanskrit: “Datta. Dayadhvam. ‘Damyata. / Shantih shantih shantih” I As I gestured around the room, I thought, this is why I teach, this is why I love languages. Together, in “these fragments I have shored against my ruins,” our voices bring to life the vibrant twists and turns of thought to be found between lines and between languages.

In early 2013, for example, i'l‘unes U (an educational app) had downloads surpassing 1 billion; later in the year, Apple announced that it had sold 4.5 _ million iPads to schools in the United States and Bmillion total to educational facilities worldwide.‘ ~ . At Columbia, students have a ﬁnancial incentive to purchase e-books, especially‘ for CC and Lit Hum--the majority of the texts for both classes can be downloaded for free on ißooks for the iPhone and for the Kindleapp on Android devices. This is ﬁnancially farbetter than it dropping over $2OO on a box set of books. Moreover, these devices and their respective apps have been designed to allow for taking and easily accessing notes. I’ll be the ﬁrst to admit I enjoyed reading David Hume over break—not on account of his writing style, but because I read the text on my phone. As an obsessive notetaker, using my phone felt liberating. . The l'l€Xt generation WOl‘l’t, share 0111' A nostalgia for traditional books. a I have no intention of initiating a debate over which I reading medium is better—compelling arguments exists both for traditional books and e-books, and in the end, it boils down to personal preference. If you’re looking for a nostalgia-tinged listicle on why the smell of paper is the best thing ever or an environmentally—tinged endorsement of E Ink displays, look elsewhere. I I Instead, it’s more important that we ask exactly how Columbia classes, especially Contemporary Civilizationand Literature Humanities, intend to adapt to changing technology. Contemporary Civilization and Literature Humanities are just another reafﬁrmation of the lasting . power of printed text, but the next generation of students won’t share our nostalgiafor traditional books—~e-books ‘: are their reality. We have to be conscious of that and re— j’ spond accordingly. It’s time for students and the administration to consider how to effectively integrate electronic devices in Core classes. Otherwise, We’ll soon befaced : with a student body that’s more comfortable reading on . electronic devices than being taught by professors that .. ‘ misunderstand and prohibit the use of these devices. ' One CC professor I spoke to told me that electronic “ devices create an atmosphere that isn’t conducive to the \ Core seminar setting. That’s hard to dispute—the ease l with which we can multitask on electronic devices is at » odds with the attentive atmosphere demanded of a CC discussion section. Sometimes unconsciously, almost mechanically, I’ll open mylaptop, open a new tab, and peruse Facebook. Sometimes I’ll do it with a Facebook tab already open, without even giving it a second thought. However, getting distracted is not a phenomenon that originated with electronic devices. I’ve doodled in my notebooks and fallen asleep in class more times than I dare to admit. While devices certainly afford students a greater variety of ways by which to slack off, ultimately, it’s the student’s responsibility to pay attention. So it’s important that we ask: How do professors combat distractions today? And how can these same techniques be applied to electronic devices? - Another interesting question that arises is the valid- » ity of testing. Some tasks, like passage identiﬁcation, - may become obsolete with the search function. Given the growing proliferation of electronic devices, by what criteria will we be measuring the skills of our students 10, 15, and 20 years from now? 3 . ‘ I’ve only begun to scratch the surface of the ques- : itionslcolumbia will be facing in the future. What of plagiarism, ﬁnding page ""numbers, and matching edi- ‘I tions? Professors teach CC in wildly different ways, and ultimately implementation will differ across the . sections. Still, guidelines need to be considered for the 1' digital age.

623,USenate candidates share platforms,28 March 2014,"12 candidates running for CC, A GS, SEAS Vacancies ‘BY ELIZABETH SEDRAN Spectator Senior Staff Writer The race is on. Twelve candidates are running to ﬁll the Columbia College, School of Engineering and _Applied Science, and School of General Studies University Senate seats this election. Candidates are focusing on issues that include improving the effectiveness of the quality of life survey, pushing for greater transparency, and expanding ﬁnancial aid. . JACOB JOHNSON, CC ’l7 Johnson wants to change the way senate surveys are conducted so that they comprise a series of shorter surveys instead of a single long survey. . “We need to let our represen- . tatives speak through surveys,” Johnson said. “We need to really represent the issue of all the students.” , “If the students are asking for something different than the status quo, if tlley’re not affirming the status quo then the senate must vote on that, if there’s a strong response,” he added. Johnson, who ran for senate during the fall special election, also thinks that the senate should end debates on the smoking ban and implement the current plan. “The debate has gone on for a ridiculous amount of time and has sort of been pointless,” he said. DANIEL LISS, CC 'l6 Liss, the current Columbia College Student Council alumni ‘affairs representative, wants to speed up the release of data from the quality of life survey and transfer responsibility for analyzing the data from senate members to a University ofﬁce. “I think it was an important issue that the senators have worked on. It also sucked a lot of the oxygen over the past couple of years,”he said. ~ Liss also wants to create a way to let students access course syllabi and grading curve data during registration. He said that releasing syllabi would help students plan for the costs of textbooks when selecting courses. Another aspect of Liss’s platform involves increasing the number of Columbia-speciﬁc internships and giving students access to the alumni directory. “I think career placement is an issue that affects every student if they’re interested in having a job or pursuing academic plans when they graduate,” Liss said. “It contributes to the baseline stress that students associate with other aspects of the University.” . MicHAI:L MACKAY, CC ’l5 MacKay, who is currently studying abroad at the University of Oxford, is focusing his campaign , on improving the role of technology in student government. “I think that the senate is something that should be accessible to everyone. I would set up some type of Google» Hangout once a week,” he said. “I really believe that technology is going to be the best thing we can do for our community over the course of the next three years.” MacKay, who is also a member of the Kingsmen, wants to use the senate’s authority to make changes to LionSHARE, foster student collaboration for startups, and encourage the development of online platforms like Piazza, through which students can ask for help ...wi,t.h cla.ss,es.;. I .. , . . ' “It creates an information ﬂow where you can really know what’s expected of you,” he said. “The technology is already there, more or less. We don’t have that drive yet, to push that into our own pedagogy. We’re moving into a newparadigm of teaching.” _.» Mac Kay said he chose to campaign on technological improvements because of the limitations he sees in the quality of life survey. “I guess the big question is what is done with the quality of ~ life survey that has taken so long,” he said. “The student bodyis expecting some sort of result from that endeavor.” , DANIEL STONE, CC ’l6 Stone, an editor for The Lion, wants senate committee meetings . to be open by default and to create a student-elected position on the board of trustees. “It would allow student feed- - back to ultimately be heard by the board of trustees who govern this university,” he said. Stone also stressed the importance of transparency in the senate’s rules committee, which deals with issues such as students’ right to protest. ' “I think it should worry students that the way free speech is being handled on this campus is dealt with so secretly,” he said. Along with his transparencycentric platform, Stone advocates relocating the Rape Crisis/ Anti-Violence Support Center toa morecentral location. “It’s an encumbrance to people whoidon’t live in the quad. This hurdle shouldn’t exist for people who are in terrible situations and need immediate help,” he said. ‘‘ RAMIS WADOOD, CC ’l6 ’ » Wadood, the current CCSC class president of 2016, is focusing his campaign on increasing openness in senate committee meetings, reforming mental health services, and opening cross-reg-istration for classes across all undergraduate and graduate schools. _ Wadood,who currently serves as a senate staffer, said that he hopes to increase the number of students who can serve as staffers. - “I’ve spent countless sleepless nights working on the senate. There’ve been a lot of all-night-ers pulled for senate,” he said. “I think that expanding the staff will give students more opportunities to be involved but it will also take a lot of work off the staffers and the senators.” ' Wadood wants senate meetings open to the public by default, so each committee would have to , vote to justify to close a speciﬁc meeting. Currently, only Student Affairs Committee meetings are open by default.MICHELLE HAINES, SEAS ’l5 ‘Haines Wants to improve ﬁ- ' nancial aid and housing opportu- , nities for international students and 3-2 engineering students. Both groups currently do not have need-blind admissions policies. “3-2 students aren’t guaranteed housing, or full ﬁnancial-aid to be met,'and that’s just small stuff students have to deal With,” she said. “The fact that international students‘ aren’t accepted need-blind is a huge conﬂict of interest to our student body.” ’ Haines also thinks that her lack of connection With the Engineering Student Council will help bring additional student voices to university discussions. .“There’s a huge communication gap between the administration and the students,” she said. J ILLIAN Ross, SEAS ’l6 Ross, the current Engineering Student Council vice president for communications, said her ESC experience will help her promote . existing initiatives like sexual assault policy reform and improve , student access to University data, She also wants to build closer connections between SEAS and the global centers. “A lot of SEAS students aren’t able to study abroad, or areunaware of these great global centers Columbia has, and unaware of how we can best utilize these,” she said. ’ V Ross also hopes that opening up data will encourage students to create app_s that improve student life. “Columbia collects a lot of data every day on students, like swipes in John Jay, etc.,” she said. “So releasing that data can be used for , applications or just used to improve everyday Columbia apps and everyday Columbia life.” KATHERINE CELETANO, GS ’l7 Celentano, who formerly Worked as a senate legislative assistant, said that as senator, she would focus on improving ﬁnancial aid for GS students and help students get the resources they need. “The number one most important issue for GS students is unequivocally ﬁnancial aid,” she said. Celentano, also a student representative for the Columbia University Family ,Support Network and former president of Students for a Sensible Drug Policy, said she will advocate for improving resources for families and providing students with resources to learn coding. “I think that right now, we’re inan interesting bubble where you see elementary schools starting to teach coding, and a job market that suddenly demands this of our graduates,” Celenato said. - CALVIN Cl-lING, GS ’l6 Ching, currently the legislative assistant for the General Studies Student Council, Wants to expand childcare services for GS students and ensure that non-residential students have the same access to medical resources. . “GS has an established reputation as an undergraduate college for nontraditional students, and as part of that deﬁnition we expect to include people with children,” he said. “There’s absolutely no excuse for us to not have adequate childcare facilities.” V , Ching thinks that moving the Rape Crisis Center/Anti-Violence Support Center would be a valuable step in improving this. ' “The Rape Crisis Center is located in a building for which swipe access is not available to GS-ers, and that’s something I hope to correct,” he said. ‘ JIN HAN, GS ’l6 Han wants to improve student life by providing better information on administrators and improving the resources availableto’ help undocumented students. “I’m actually considered an undocumented student, so it gives me the unique position to understand the needs of What students like myself are put through,” he said.’ V V Han also wants to give military students access to the gyms at the Campbell Sports Center, which athletes already have access to, because they are often required to meet a certain standard of ﬁtness. UMAR VMOHAMMED, GS ’l5 Moharnrned wants to overhaul the University’s leave of absence policy and ﬁnd Ways to bring GS closer to the other undergraduate schools. “I would like to see integration in the GS community-during orientation, we can have a program between GS, and Barnard, and _ CC,” he said in an interview.

Since 1979, SEAS students have been required to take University Writing and the physical education requirement.

625,The Core needs to teach history and philosophy of science in Frontiers,3 April 2014,"BY ALLISON SCOTT - Like all top research universities, Columbia advertises to prospective students its “leading scientiﬁc discoveries” and the many ﬁelds of which it is at the forefront. I am proud of the research I have participated in during my time here. I have been starstruck at lectures byinﬂuential scientists, and I’ve been inspired to make my own discoveries. However, during my semester abroad, I have come to realize that a key part of my scientiﬁc education at Columbia was missing. What our undergraduate education lacks is the historical background of science to balance the educational focus on the avant-garde. I am not just advocating the better availability of courses in the history and philosophy of science (the interdepartmental committee of history and philosophy of science currently offers one class)—l am advocating the replacement of Frontiers of Science with such a class. My concerns about the Core Curriculum’s stance on science ﬁrst arose during my Frontiers of Science lectures as a ﬁrst-year. However, it was only after taking history and philosophy of science courses at University College London (UCL) this semester that I was able to articulate my feelings. At UCL, the department of science and technology studies offers undergraduate degrees in the history and philosophy of science. Unlike at Columbia, the discipline occupies its own space and gamers the requisite respect as a result. The scientiﬁc will to truth does not exempt science from the , subjectivity of humans who conduct it. Science, like any other ﬁeld, should not fall victim to a Whig-like historical perspective. Only by looking at history can we understand the ideologies underlying the truths We hold in the present.The current frustration shared by a majority of Columbia‘ College students is the ,“SparkNotes” version of science We are exposed to during Frontiers. It assumes the somewhat patronizing deﬁcit model of students’ understandiflg, which alienates students of all backgrounds. Although the class is getting a much-needed overhaul soon, from what I understand, the changes are more structural than they are the-' matic.‘ Science’s unjustiﬁed reputation as “other” remains its biggest obstacle to assimilation into the Core. In fact, science poses important questions that affect- the lives of all students, regardless of their decision to pursue it later in life; What is objectivity? What is observable? What can we say is, knowledge?'Jus_t as answers to these questions can be traced back to the Greeks we read in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization,~so too have the sciences ‘aimed to resolve these queries. By reading the Great Thinkers in philosophy of science, we can trace the paths of these questions and thoughts just like we do through literature and political philosophy, avoiding the self-congratulatory, teleological, and distancing stance taken by Frontiers of Science. The Frontiers of Science website states that its goal is to “inculcate in them [the students] the habits of mind common to a scientiﬁc approach to the World,” which directly contradicts the goals of the Core. Not only does it assume the myth of a singular scientiﬁc approach, it ignores any drive i for students to approach science from their own perspec- , tive. The Core, Curriculum website poses a critical epistemic question: ‘What do we think is, and What have we thought to be worth knowing?’’. . - Frontiers doesn’t allow us to answer those questions for o ’ ourselves--rather‘, it tells us. And it tells us in a way thatimplies that these facts are indisputable knowledge. Perhaps this is because of the false idea that science requires a singular, empirical mode of thought that we must be taught. This is a dangerous state of mind, and a class like Frontiers only propagates the dogma. Additionally, the class implies that all ﬁelds of science require this singular reasoning, and that this “original” approach hasn’t changed since the Renaissance. (I’m serious, go‘ read the_Frontiers of Science website.) Science’s unjustiﬁed reputation as “other’f,remains its biggest obstacle to assimilation into the Core. If we are to look with a critical eye at the data presented to us, we must be equally skeptical of the epistemic Virtues underlying the practices that got us that data. I only care enough to Write about what I ﬁnd missing from the Core because I am indebted to What it has already done for me. Columbia taught me to ‘question my education and seek an- ' l swers. The Core has shown me how to look at the past and be critical of the present.

626,Add course on gender and identity to Core,9 April 2014,"BY ABBY MITCHELL V ' ‘ At a 1987 lecture in Low Memorial Library, English professor Carolyn Heilbrtm took on Columbia’s greatest institution: the Core Curriculum. Heilbrun said, “In recent years the educational establishment in the United States, and those in charge of teaching the humanities in the universities, have insisted upon the importance of our ‘legacy’ and of the connection of that ‘legacy’ to the ‘life of the mind’ and to certain unchanging truths. The entrance of women students into almost every male college and university raises the question of how political the protection of that ‘legacy’ is and what effect the changing lives of women in our society should have upon university policy.” . She continued, “The academic community must face the necessity of moving women from the margins of universities to their center. Not to do so will indicate the degree to which the male tradition has dictated _ what questions we may ask of our universities, our C ‘legacy,’ and of our ‘old fashioned values?” l Nearly 30 years after Heilbrun’s speech, this is still a central problem created by the Core Curriculum. Our administration protects the Core tooth and nail, yet we rarely question whether it’s teaching us all the ' right lessons or exposing us to the well-rounded legacy ’ we deserve from our education. l’m a Columbia College woman who has completj ed the Core. And, by and large, I’m a fan of the Core Curriculum. At a school like Columbia, where athlet- ' ics do not shape University life, the Core ﬁlls that void. It’s what you bring up when you’re feeling awkward at a networking event or if you happen to be seated next to an alum on a plane. Put bluntly, you can’t ﬁnd a living Columbia alum who hasn’t suffered through g‘ Homer and Plato. The Core is nearly 100 years old and V not going anywhere. ‘ Women, by contrast, have been at ColumbiaCollege for only 30 years. This disparity demonstrates an inevitable truth of the “legacy” of the Core: It was not designed for or by women. Indeed, the father of the Core Curriculum, professor John Erskine, CC 1900, saw the Core as a means to prevent the incursion of women. a In 1936, he wrote an essay called “The Inﬂuence of Women and Its Cure.” In Erskine’s words, “Let the boys be taught by men and encouraged to be masculine—not to imitate the manners of the cave dweller but to cultivate initiative, persistence, backbone.” He wrote, “If the older American stocks won’t pass on their tradition the path of our ideas will be rapidly changed. Or, if the men won’t teach and- the women Will, the balance of the sexes will be upset and ours will be a feminine civilization.” . V Those sentiments may be kept out of his shrine in Hamilton Hall, but they demonstrate the central bias ' of the “unchanging truths” in the Core Curriculum: a desire to preserve tradition——speciﬁcally, a maledominated tradition—in the minds of youths. Looking at our Core today, you’ll see efforts toWard inclusivity: the addition of authors like Virginia Woolf and Mary Wollstonecraft or texts like Lysistrata and Medea. Despite popular opinion, there certainly were Women writing and theorizing before modern times——one such example would be 17th-century author Madame de Lafayette, who enjoyed a brief stint . on the Literature Humanities course list Devoting one class session to suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s The Woman’s Bible, a 19th-century bible revision meant to challenge patriarchy in religion, would certainly spice up the notoriously dull religious portion of Contemporary Civilization. But it Wouldn’t be productive to argue for total equality in gender distribution in the Core. Adding a book entails removing another, and most of the Core’s old white dudes are here to stay. However, its important that we all recognize that,in a college Where over 50 percent of the student body is female, women are relatively absent from the courses and reading lists considered most necessary to our education. We cannot continue to dismiss this problem in defense of “legacy.” V If the Global Core requirement is meant to account for bias toward Western thought—-as flawed as that requirement might be——it’s high time to consider an addition to adjust for the masculine bias. Anyone who has taken acourse in women and gender studies can tell you the classes are generallyoverwhelmingly female. The same, of course, can be said for classes on race and ethnicity and students of color. Identifying with a topic makes you more likely to want to engage with it intellectually. ' Among its many other virtues, the Core creates a captive audience: A student who has no intention of studying philosophy or classics is forced to do so in a class that demands participation and effort. You can’t avoid the Core or its seminar setting. Yet this compulsory aspect of the Core creates a unique opportunity for Columbia to challenge students in the very topic it now so staunchly ignores. If the University were to add a course devoted to questions of identity, gender, and bias, the College would not only engage an untapped branch of historical and philosophical thinking, but in doing ‘so, Columbia College would also challenge its own history. I can only imagine all of the possibilities that such a course could hold and all of the amazing women who could form its backbone. . We need a Core Curriculum in which women are not relegated to the margins or thrown in haphazardly in the name of equality. If the goal of the Core is to better prepare us for life and expand our way of thinking, then perhaps it should start with an expansion of its own limited perspective.

627,Traditions that venerate women are overlooked,9 April 2014,"BY LUKE FOSTER . ~ The Core Curriculum, with its power to open our minds and hearts, has a way of confronting us with unpalatable perspectives. If the ﬁelds of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Music Humanities, and Art Humanities are like quiet pas- _ _ ture_s of contemplation tucked away above the clouds of our everyday assumptions, sometimes there is a stiff, cold windblowing in these uplands. And it can slap us in the face, abruptly and unpleasantly. The dearth of women authors in the Core is one such jarring reality. It is disconcerting that with all the poetry by women in the ancient world, not much survives beyond a few fragments of Sappho. Even in much more familiar and recent contexts, women’s voices have been marginalized. All of Evans’ ; work was published under a pseudonym, George Eliot. One common response to this problem is to read the women who did author Core texts—Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf- ‘ as speaking only for women. My Contemporary Civilization class spent a great deal of time asking if Wollstonecraft was a proto -feminist, and in Lit Hum we questioned whether Austen was trying to subvert the sexual norms of her time. What bothers me about this approach is that it canactually be degrading to the authors and their ideas. None of these authors were directly concerned with the political ideologies of our time, and we shouldn’t . try to ﬁt them into our categories, or repurpose their work for another meaning. To honor their achievements in providing insight into human nature is to _ be willing to listen to what they have to say about all _of our experiences. Austen is a brilliant satirist who introduces her readers to sparkling depths of subtlety in the most everyday conversations. We often assume that our age has progressed and N that women are better treated now than ever before. In manyvital areas, that claim is justiﬁed. In 21st—century Western society, fewer women die during childbirth ' than at any other point in our history. Today, Mary Ann Evans would be encouraged to publish her own work and regarded as an excellent writer in her own right. But one of the great merits of the Core is its power to let ideas from starkly different times speak for themselves. And just as we should respect and listen to other cultures on their own terms, we should extend the same generosity of spirit to our ancestors. . We sometimes stereotype the entirety of Western thought as a Faust—like ﬁgure: the rationalistic male intellectual who seduces, silences, and objectiﬁes ‘ Gretchen. But there is much more to the great tradition of the West than that. One of the tenderestmoments in the Iliad comes as Hector returns from the bloodshed to his Wife Andromache and his baby son Astyanax. Hector recognizes that male-Warrior glory, kleos, is only valuable because it protects the domestic realm that his wife governs. _ And the rise of Christianity in the ancient World provided further reason to dignify Women. The Gospel of Luke tells the story of the Virgin Mary and claims she changed history by choosing to bear and raise the baby Jesus. Mary’s song, the Magniﬁcat, proclaims, “From now on all generations will call me blessed,” and this elevation of motherhood to an ofﬁce of eternal glory would suffuse later Christian thought. Augustine, in his Confessions, acknowledges the saintliness of his mother Monica, a constant source of stability for him while he does his best to destroy himself. The Core exposes us to a tradition that ennobled and honored women as mothers, even as it often conﬁned women to the domestic sphere. It's Worth asking ourselves whether our contemporary culture is truly better at valuing women. Yes, We do better at acknowledging the excellence of Women, but we tend to measure excellence in quantiﬁable achievements like earning a paycheck or contributing to the GDP. ‘ The vast sacriﬁce of health, time, and love that millions of mothers—including my own-—give to their children is too often denigrated. Prioritizingmotherhood should be an honored choice for Women to make. But the dominant narrative is that an excellent education shouldn’t be channeled into raising children. Too many college campuses, including ‘ Columbia, fail to do enough to help student mothers. The ﬁnal Week of Art Humanities, last spring made this point tangible for me. My professor juxtaposed Raphael’s’ Sistine Madonna and Picasso’s Les Demoiselles Diélvignon. The 16th-century painting integrated all its elements, with harmony and grace, around the queenly poise of Mary, the Mother of God And the 20th-century cubist piece rendered the viewer complicit in the horrifyingvoyeurism of the female body stripped down to an object The Core hammered home to me the irony that, even though there are more women in board rooms and in faculty lounges than ever before, the Western world has become complacent with a vast industry dedicated to the obj ectiﬁca—tion of women: pornography. _ Clearly, in some vital Ways, we are missing wisdom that our ancestors would have taken for granted. We should honor the women of the Core for their excellence, not just for their politics, and we should also allow the Core to challenge us to strive for a more complete vision of Women’s dignity.

628,Create a separate class to explore women’s writing,9 April 2014,"BY BRITT FOSSUM Barnard College’s First-Year Foundations courses, First-Year Seminar and First-Year English, are a required part of the—Barnard curriculum for all students. Unlike Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilization, these classes don’t share a syllabus of texts but rather have speciﬁc focal topics. One is dedicated to “Women and Culture.” The two other major literature courses’ syllabi, on the other hand, are full of male writers and thinkers, though one of the two does include several writers excluded from Literature ‘ Humanities, such as Margery Kempe, Madame de Lafayette, and Mary Shelley. A different focus is needed in order to deal with female voices because of a disappointing truth about the past: The writers and philosophers we acknowledge and celebrate were not women. Even the inclusion of the aforementioned writers is somewhat questionable. Were the texts The Book of Margery Kempe, The Princesse den Cleves, or even Frankenstein truly so signiﬁcant.in their time that they warrant sharing a syllabus with Don Quixote or the Odyssey? Texts included in the Core Curriculum must be signiﬁcant today. But when these classes are also framed as part of a study of Western thought, the texts must have been inﬂuential in their own time periods. The syllabus for Literature Humanities, for example, is carefully put together (and sometimes modiﬁed by professors) to ﬁt a particular pattern of Western thought; the rise of interiority and the inner self. This process culminates in Virginia Woolf—her To the Lighthouse is difﬁcult to read and downright armoying, but it really is the perfect book to ﬁnish Lit Hum with, as an example of internal narrative. ,But does it reallybeneﬁt the Core Curriculum to throw in additional female writers just for the sake of having more female voices? ' Columbia can’t improve the Core byethrowing in gratuitous female writers. By limiting the scope of Core classes to the traditional canon of literature and philosophy, ﬁrst-years will read Jane Austen as the ﬁrst female writer. Is there really any way around this? All We have left is scraps of Sappho’s poetry and a few works by medieval writers and theologians. There are, of course, excellent female vvriters——it is just that the set criteria that deﬁne the Core Curriculum must exclude them. Finding female writers who inﬂuenced mainstream thought in their time requires broadening the scope of the Core syllabus. What of Lady Murasaki’s The Tale of Genji? As a Japanese writer, Lady-Murasaki clearly wrote outside of the Western tradition. Similarly, women writers, even’those‘considered to be from the Western world, also-wrote outside of the Western tradition of the time, which largely excluded women. . * Would anyone really choose ‘to drop Inferno in favor of a lesser (or lesser-known and referenced) work just for the sake of adding another woman’s name to the list? In this vein, some Contemporary Civilization professors- choose to teach John Stuart Mill’s The Subjection ofWomen instead of Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman because Mill’s text is more rigorous and well-written. So why not do as Barnard has done and add the option of a women’s studies course to the Core? We have Global Core classes to present a non-Western viewpoint (another critique of the Core), so why not also focus on women in a‘ separate class? There are plenty of fascinating courses that focus on women and literature by women, but Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, and Art and Music Humanities have very different foci. They are stuvey courses, and unfortunately for women throughout history, only in very recent centuries have Women been free enough in society to show up on a “greatest hits” list of inﬂuential thinkers. . _ Adding extra women to the Core constructs a false history—-one where women were able to have their thoughts celebrated and held to the same standards as men. We don’t need to have women’s works lumped into a narrative of philosophical development from which their Works were forcibly excluded or never had the chance to exist. The great women of history deserve their own narrative— one that is very different from that of the traditional Western canon. A Britt Fossum is a Columbia College sophomore majoring in chemistry.

629,"Tackle Core questions with experience, not just texts",17 April 2014,"‘ ' BY DARPAN PATEL ’ The Core Curriculum was conceived to facilitate student exploration of identity, community, political economy, and other topics of the human condition. Through the Core’s texts, we can examine our existence and discern guiding morals and philosophical truths that have emerged through the ages. Organizing the texts into a canon of Western thought, however, results in a framework that in many ways hinders the original intent of the Core: to approach the fundamental questions, “What does it mean, and what has it meant to be an individual? to be partof a community?” The works 7in the Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization syllabi are selected based on their perceived inﬂuence on Western thought, with the assumption that the differences among these texts and among those of contemporary society encourage introspection. While this may be true, these viewpoints arise from a relatively homogeneous source—men inthe'Western world. No combination of these Writers can capture a full spectrum of voices and experiences. The limited diversity of the voices represented in the Core detracts from its mission to comprehensively consider what it means to be human. This is par- ‘ ticularly dangerous given that the perspectives we develop in Core classes are meant to be the basis for understanding our personal and civic responsibilities. For example, how are we to consider the role of women in » society given that the total number of female writers present in Lit Humand CC can be counted on one hand? In his piece in last week’s Canon on female authors in the Core (“Exploring female perspective within male-authored works,” April 8), Anirban Poddar advocates examining the role of women through the lens of male-centric texts. He rationalizes female writers’ exclusion from the Core syllabi as a result of there being no extended history of inﬂuential female writing, and writes that we would be “trivializing” women by including more of their works solely due to their sex. However, if we are to understand what it means to be “part of a community” at any time in history, the female perspective cannot be disregarded—and it must come from a female author to adequately represent the embodied experiences of women. More to the point, there already exists a wealth of texts by inﬂuential female writers from more contemporary times. Failure to include these texts contradicts the broader mandate of the Core—how can we explore “human” questions if there is only a particular type of f‘human” life being examined? Accepting this lack of representation and simply analyzing secondary accounts of entire bodies of people is not an acceptable solution. - Rather than interpreting “identity” and “community” through texts, what if we were to project our own experiences toward these questions directly? Imagine a seminar in which there are simply central themes to explore: race, gender, political structure, and consciousness. If discussion is"" supported (but not deﬁned) by critical texts exploring these issues, the class may better expose students’ ideas towards these issues rather than comparative evaluations of others’ perspectives, however inﬂuential those maybe. Such a discussion would allow -students’ experiences to become the primary resource for addressing these questions, resulting in a more natural route to introspection. In doing so, we may ﬁnally be able to integrate the female perspective, and those of other identities marginalized by the Core—-people of color, those who do not identify as part of the gender binary,‘ and all permutations of these and other conﬁgurations of self. Certainly this does not fully resolve the disadvantages of a Western-dominated Core, but a discussion-based auxiliary course might help foster a broader awareness of human perspectives. Splitting up such a class into modules might be helpful, with units taught by a series of cycling professors, I each working on one of these central issues. There are many structural considerations (i.e. should it replace an existing course of the already numerous Core requirements?), but, conceptually, I think a seminar of this type complements the existing courses in the Core and could help bridge the gap we experience by connecting our personal narratives to these questions of identity and community. If the Core is to promote our understanding of what it means to be human, it must ﬁrst reﬂect the broad spectrum of experiences that underlie our constructed selves. We are often pushed to speak broadly and loudly, sometimes with little regard to the boundaries of others’ identities. How better to situate oneself within society than by listening and reﬂecting on the myriad primary, non-interpretive experiences readily available from the diverse student population at Columbia? We have longbeen told our peers are our most valuable resource. It is high time we institutionalize that sentiment within the Core itself. ‘ The author is a Columbia College senior majoring in biology."
630,THE ART OF THE MATTER,17 April 2014,"STUDYING VISUAL ARTS/AT A LIBERAL ARTS SCHOOL BY SUZE MYERS ° I AOn Wikipedia’s list of notable Columbia College alumni and affiliates, only six Visual artists are listed, with the most recent graduating in 1974. On the equivalent list for Barnard Col- "" lege, there are only three, comprising one of the smallest categories on the page—~“Artists” outnumber only “Architects” and “Fictional Alumnae.” Even “Spies” has four entries. While Wikipedia (as our professors so often like to remind us) is no official authority by any account, there issome truth in these findings: Columbia and Barnard’s liberal arts orientation places less emphasis on fine art than on almost any other subject, a tendency that is clear to me as an art history major. The discipline certainly eXists—as a major at Columbia College, and as a Visual arts concentration Within the art historymajor at Barnardabut not to the degree that one would expect of a major university located in What is, or at least what once was, the art capital of the World. B So why come here, a university built upon ‘a core curriculum, to study visual arts? Unlike art schools such as’Pratt Institute or the School of Visual Arts , Columbia and Barnard do not ” grant Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees. Instead, like the rest of their undergraduate peers, art students receive a Bachelor of Arts. And While art is taken seriously within its respective departments, many students feel that campus * culture on the Whole is not supportive of the visual arts, instead building creative commu--nities around the arguably more collaborative disciplines of music and theater.‘ Yet visual arts students here seem to be in conse.nsus: Despite lacking many elements of the traditional art education, the unorthodox 1 nature of Columbia and Barnard’s art programs is a strength, not a Weakness. The Department ‘‘ \ ‘ For the unacquainted, the Visual arts at Columbia are not easy to find: Classes are split between Dodge Hall, just left of the main gates on Broadway, Watson Hall on 115th Street, and Prentis Hall, a building on 125th Street that is currently considered part of the Morningside campus, despite being a 20-minute Walk from 1 Butler. Combined, these three buildings house the Various studios and classrooms that make up the School of the Arts and its undergraduatecounterpart, the Columbia College visual arts department. ‘~ . The department itself is smaller than most, ~ with just nine faculty members. Students can elect . to complete the art major, the concentration, or v the joint major with the Art History department. Of the three options, it is the visual arts . major whose experience most resembles that of a BFA program: Students are required to take Basic Drawing, Sculpture .1, and six other 3000—level studio courses, as well as Twentieith Century Art, one semester of the Barnard art history survey, and Eye and Idea, a seminar introducing majors to the New York art world. Senior majors take four two—point classes over their last two semesters, during which they de~ Velop and execute a mandatory thesis project. Despite this intensive technical and conceptual arts training, the experience of an art major is still largely concerned with the liberalarts—a fact that does not deter art students, many of whom came to Columbia considering other academic paths. ~ f‘l didn’t apply here thinking I would be an art major,” says Natalie Moore, a Columbia College junior and visual arts major. Though she considered herself an artist before coming to Columbia, she originally planned to study archaeology; “Everyone in high school asked me if I was going to go to an art school, and I would constantly tell them, ‘No, I’m not going to do that.’ And then I ended up majoring in it anyway. ” A Well—Rounded Education I In many ways, it’s logical: An interest in pursuing art does not necessarily negate aninterest in other disciplines, especially at a school like Columbia that attracts multitalented, academia cally inclined students. But while a liberal arts education does mean a more rounded overall experience, it also belies a thorough technical - art training that most BFA’programs provide. At the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, there are 12 different art and design majors a student can choose from, including fine arts, industrial design, ’ and photography. Some schools, like the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, R. 1., are even more specialized, offering BFAS in media like . glass, ceramics, printmaking, and textiles, among others. While certainly not lacking in resources, I the Columbia visual arts department is just that—a departrnent-and does not provide the technical focus of art and design schools, especially in the context of the wider Columbia education and the importance of the Core. “I talked to this guy who was studying . furniture design at RISD, and it was awesometo hear him say, ‘Oh, that’s a chair from this certain classic 1940 s collection,”’ says Emma - Sulkowicz, a Columbia College junior and a , visual arts major. “He knows everything about something very specific, and that’s something really cool that we don’t have. But I prefer this, the non—applied arts.” I _ “If I would have wanted so badly to just be doing art for the whole four years, I probably should have applied to an art school,_” says Moore. “I’m glad I didn’t. I feel like this is a much more rounded education and a differ~ ent experience than if I had just applied to art school and majored inphotography and only done that.” ” I ' For many visual arts majors, theliberal arts are important, both as a component of their education and as an influence on their work. “I really think that all classes can relate back to making art,” Sulkowicz said. “I’m taking Science of Psych for the science requirement, and we’re learning about the way the brain is conditioned to see the lines in motion. I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I have to apply that to my drawing.”’ Even when the Core requirements aren’t a direct inspiration, it’s difficult to ignore the liberal arts experience, especially in the personal and subjective discipline of art. “Within the Core requirements here and the different people that you meet and the different texts that you read, you’re exposed to a lot of different ideas,_” Moore said. “And everything that you’re exposed to in terms of ideas and peoples’ opinions ‘ does influence your work in some way. ” Yet, as with any program, there is a problem of time—the enemy of many college _ students, but especially visual arts majors, and especially within the context of a liberal arts education. Studio courses run long—from two and a half to six hours—and consequently can be difficult to schedule and balance with academic classes and coursework. And an artwork, unlike a problem set or a history paper, often lacks a natural stopping point at which ’ the artist knows it’s complete. V “Trying to get that work done and still find ' time to invest as much as you’d like to in your . artistic work has been a bit of a struggle,” Moore said. “Right now I’m -in this digital documentary class, and there’s a lot of outside things you need to be doing. I keep finding that I I have a portfolio review on Tuesday for it and ait’s Monday and I have two pictures and I was supposed to have 20. You have to rush out and make some stuff, and it’s probably not as good or as heartfelt as it could have been if you had ' more time to focus on just that.” IThe problem is especially acute at Columbia, where Core classes alone add up to ‘a minimum of 43 credits. “That’s probably my main complaint. l’m really glad I learned a new language, but I really wish I could have spent more time on my art, ” Sulkowicz said. “I’m glad I did Literature Humanities and CC [Contemporary Civilization] in general, but a lot of the time it’s really frustrating.” ’ “I’m actually afraid to leave here. ” Despite its slmall size, the program is well equipped, perhaps thanks to the School of the Arts: Between Dodge, Prentis, and Watson, the department houses a wood shop, a metal shop, a ceramics room, a printmaking studio, large—format printers, and a black—and—white darkroom, as well as basic drawing and paint—ing rooms. Access to these facilities, While not immediate nor 24/ 7 for declared art majors, isn’t difficult to obtain. “You get access to these things only as you apply for them or take classes that feature them,” Moore said. “I don’t feel like I’ve been Wanting for anything, resourcewise, since I’ve been here, because anytime I’ve wanted to do work in the darkroom, I’ve always just made sure that I’m involved enough with the photo department to be able to do it.” In addition to the dedicated classroom space, senior majors receive an individual studio in either Prentis or Watson in which to work on their thesis projects. When it comes to spaceand resources, the department is re—markably accommodating for an undergraduate liberal arts school. “I am actually afraid to leave here, because I don’t know what I’m going to . do without these resources,” Sulkowicz said. “I’ve never done printmaking or video or ceramics, but I’ve done wood sculpture—they have all the saws you would ever need, and the room is well—maintained. The metal shop—l can’t believe they have some of the things they have in there. They’re really well—equipped.” I Across the Street As a visual arts program in the context o_f a liberal arts school, many of the advantages and disadvantages of the Columbia visual arts major are similar to those of its counterpart at Barnard, with one significant difference. At Barnard, the visual arts program is formatted as a subsection within the art history department, and is only available as aconcentration in conjunction_with the art history major. Twelve courses are required for the joint program: six art history courses, five studio courses, and an . independent project seminar. While it’s not re— 'quired of ‘visual arts concentrators, seniors can elect to substitute the mandatory art history thesis for a senior studio project—a year—long endeavor that culminates in a comprehensive senior thesis show in May. The concentration itself is a relatively new development. Barnard offered a few studio courses each year, but it Wasn’t until the early ’9os, under the leadership of current art history chair Keith Moxey, that a visual arts division was created within the department. The decision to design a program as a subsection of the already-established art history department was a deliberate one, taking into account both the strengths of Barnard and its position as a small liberal arts school. ’ “It made sense at Barnard to use the . strength of the existing art history department as a source, or a resource, for the production of art-making,” says Joan Snitzer, the director of the Barnard visual arts program and a painting professor. “There are so many art academies I and art schools in Manhattan. We wanted to‘ make the Barnard program different, not try to imitate or duplicate what already existed. ” The result is decidedly different from traditional art schools and from the visual arts major across the street at Columbia. In addition to requiring a significant number of art history courses, Barnard places a significant emphasis on art history within actual studio classes. This often manifests in a syllabus of weekly reading assignments, which can be used as a springboard for studio projects. However, more often than not, a student’s background in art his-tory has more influence on her overall approach and understanding of art than on her individual works—a quality that Barnard actively seeks to cultivate by ensuring that critical theory is fully embedded throughout the visual arts program. ' “I would not be who lam today without the critical training I got from the Barnard art - history department, skills that I use every day to think about contemporary art,”. says Vanessa Thill, a 2013 Barnard graduate who majored in art history and concentrated in the visual arts. “Tobe able to visually evaluate and write I thoughtfully are not just necessary for my job, but are also satisfying for me.” » The inclusion of theory is sensible for an art program whose students’ interest in intellectual and academic work is presumed by virtue of their choice to pursue a liberal arts educa-tion. “I think you have to consider that somebody applying to Barnard is applying in the first place because they have an intellect and they Want, to use it—other Wise they would have applied just to an art school,” Snitzer said. “It seems kind of logical: Why try to make Bar--nard into an art school when somebody chose Barnard because they Wanted to be challenged in other Ways? ” I Still, the program’s structure is a point of contention for those who feel that the delegation of Visual arts to a concentration automatically subordinates the practice of art—making to the study of art history. In her afterword to the 2013 Barnard Visual Arts Senior Thesis Exhibition catalog, Lucy Hunter, a 2012 graduate of the Barnard Visual arts program, Writes: “Art education in this country is treated from the grade—school level as ‘elective,’ an add—on to a standard curriculum. These institutional biases carry on through the collegiate leVel——Barnard is a prime example.” ' ‘While the program is certainly unorthodox in its structure, part ofthe contention comes from its titl€,’WhlCl’l does treat visual arts as secondary—and does not necessarily reflect the Views of the department itself. “I think the name——‘concentration’—l think it’s time we changed it. This really is a major,” Snitzer says. “But I would not break it from art history, because I think that’s one of the pro’gram’S « strengths.” - The inclusion of theory is particularly useful at Barnard, Where the department of art history holds a prestigious place. “You have access to brilliant people to look at your Work and speak to you about your projects,” Snitzer says. “Fa—mous artistsyin the outside World would love to . have half of our faculty-personally talk to them.” “I sort of Wish I had looked into BFA programs in retrospect, programs that have more resources for Visual arts,” agrees Thill. “But I am actually really glad that I got the rigorous art theory training.” . According to Snitzer, some students enter the program skeptical, interested only in pracV tical approaches and Wary of the art history course load. But this attitude usually dissipates by the time they become fully immersed in the program. “Although they’re resistantinitially, I would say 95 percent of the majors take more than the required art history,” Snitzer says. “Once they get involved in using theiriintel—-lect in studying art history and applying it to the studio practice, they get excited. It’s not a problem. It just looks like it’s not taken seriously with this name, ‘concentration. ”’ All Theory, Some Practice The Barnard program’s emphasis on theory is balanced by a detached attitude toward technique: Instruction in the_physical processes of art—making is extremely limited, even more so than at Columbia. While students are actively making art, professors at Barnard are less likely to spend time teaching specific techniques. This is in stark contrast to many art schools and visual arts programs (including Columbia’s), where myriad foundation courses teaching the fundamentals of drawing, painting, and sculpture are generally required for every major. , Such an unorthodox lack of technical focus is in part driven by the program’s emphatic insistence on the theoretical, which tends to position technique as secondary to critical ' thought. “Technical abilities are wonderful, but you can really hire somebody to produce your work these days,” Snitzer says. “This is what we do well. We teach women to think independently, and it’s transferable. ...~—That we train people to research, to think independently, to think in—depth, to know the history of what happened before and where they stand now in the larger and global standard of art, is really . important. It puts them ahead.” And, as with anything in New York, tech— V nicalinstruction is,n’t hard to find outside of Morningside. Institutions like the Art Students League of New York and the International Center of Photography offer classes for the public, and many art schools, including Pratt and Par- V sons The New School for Design have summer programs open to undergraduates from other colleges and universities. “We make suggestions, and people do take classes elsewhere in technique—over the summer, or across the street, or at other institutions” Snitzer says. “Barnard . women are smart. You can pick up these ideas. ' You can find somebody who will show you how to do ceramics, or how to weld sculpture.” Still, some students say they find the scar‘? city of technical instruction frustrating if they lack previous experience in a certain medium, or desire structured direction within their program. “I wish I had sought out studio classes that offer more concrete technical training,”"

I love to abandon homework and-wander across this grand old campus, prompted by sights like the inscription over the fireplace in John Jayz‘ “Hold fast to the spirit of youth. Let the years to come do-what they may.” Or sometimes, in a more _ morbid mood, I’ll consider the lettering in JJ’s Place: » “These men of the Class of 1915 died for their country.” , History lies thickly all around us at Columbia. Sometimes, it’s worth stopping as you climb the West- . ern staircase to the third floor of Butler and stare a General and President Eisenhower in the eye. It always makes me realize that, had the two great totalitarian regimes he fought.triumphed, I wouldn’t be here. The freedom to think and study is a great gift. And, when I remember that, the textbooks slung over my shoulder always feel a lot lighter. v Every senior I’ve talked to feels regret at leaving ~i this beautiful and storied place, while everyone else just can't wait to survive the semester, Sometimes I worry that we spend four yearsat Columbia jumping through hoops-—applying for the next internship, researching the next paper, scribbling the next problem ’ set-while hardly ever pausing to drink in, ‘with awe and gratitude, the wonder of the moments given to us. ’ Each experience is only valuable as a building block for grander‘ things, not worthy in and of itself. The problem with that ambitious attitude is that it provokes an unanswerable dissatisfaction. If we see each chapter in our lives as only setting up the next, it will be impossible to delight in the intrinsic goodness of the things we’re given. When _will we be able to rest content?

632,Learning from peers and outside the classroom,28 April 2014,"BY PETER ANDREWS I took 40 classes in my time at Columbia, including three physical education classes (floor hockey forever!) and four courses at University College London. . I learned a lot of stuff. And I mean a lot of stuff——so much stuff that there is no way I’ll remember it all. I learned stuff about music , and art, about the farthest reaches of the solar system and the smallest components of an atom, and about the history of humans across this world that’s somehow much too small and . too big to adequately comprehend. , ‘But when I first arrived here, just less than four years ago, I would not have been surprised by any of this. These are the sorts ‘of things you’re supposed to learn at a school like Columbia. I ,“For where your treasure is, , there your heart will be also.” What I would be surprised by, though, is what I learned during the hours when I wasn’t in class. I learned how to play my trombone so loud that other people would cover their ears in desperation. I learned that Columbia athletics is a small, weird, and strangely beautiful corner of -the sports‘ world, I learned how to talk about basketball on the radio,.accelel=ating my speaking pace to supersonic speeds. I learned that Roar-ee the Lion is one tough animal, that cracking a whip without hurting yourself is harder than it looks, and that it might snow in New York City anytime from October to April. All of this doesn’t even include what I’ve learned from and about my classmates. It turns out that there’s always a person or two who can teach you something new, who loves the same things as you but approaches them differently--‘or even thinks the things you love are ridiculous. (I am speaking directly to certain New York fYankees and Dallas Cowboys fans here.) : Many of those classmates I met here at Spectator. The greatest thing» about Spec is that nothing happens in isolation. Writers, editors, coders, salespeople—hundreds of people working together five nights a week to put together a paper we were all proud of. It would be unfair of me to try to mention every ‘ person at Spec who has changed my life, in one wayor another. But you all mean. so much to me, and I’m thankful for the time we spent. together, whether it was just one conversation or hundreds and hundreds. Amid the hundreds of thousands—probably millions—of words that.l’ve read in those 40 courses, 11 of them stand out to me above all else. Near the end of the first semester of Literature Humanities, we read the_ Gospel of Luke. It’s been almost four years, but one phrase still rings in my head—chapter 12, verse 34. “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” ' ; A piece of my heart will always be here at Columbia, either on the green turf of Baker Field or on the 20th floor of East Campus or in the offices-of Spectator.

633,CCSC plans return of Columbia College Days,16 October 2014,"BY DYLAN COOPER Spectator Staﬁ"" Writer Two years after Columbia College Student Council chose to replace College Dayswith the Columbia Music Festival, student leaders are now planning to reinstate the Weeklong celebration of Columbia College spirit. Tentatively scheduled for the ﬁrst week of April, CCSC members said they want to build each day around a different Core Curriculum class. 1 “In Columbia College, there’s a need for big headliner events that the campus could rally around,” CCSC Vice President for Campus Life Andrew Ren, CC ’l5, said. “And College Days could do just that.” College Days will launch with an opening ceremony and campus-wide displays celebrating Literature Humanities Day. The rest of the week will include Contemporary Civilization Day highlighting Columbia’s history, Art Humanities Day featuring stu- V dent artwork and workshops, and Swim Test Day focusing on more fun activities and promoting selfcare tips. Global Core/Science Requirement Day will feature events organized by student groups, while Ren said he wants to work with campus music groups to organize performances‘ for Music Humanities Day. g “In coming up with a framework, it is crucial that College Days would have a very organized structure,” Ren said. “We want to create a template that could be instituted for future yearsas well.” » Ren said that having experienced College Days as a ﬁrst-year, he thinks there is a lack of events speciﬁcally geared toward’promoting Columbia College spirit. “There was a conspicuous absence of something celebrating being a Columbia College student and that’s why the event is in existence,” he said. Engineering Student Council has held an annual Engineering Week featuring speakers, workshops, and activities since 1996, while Barnard’s Student Government Association holds an armual Spirit Week in April, thelatest iteration of Barnard’s longrunning Greek Games tradition. CCSC created College Days in 2002, and the initiative expanded—and became more expensive—every year. The 2004 week featured a scavenger hunt with a $4OO grand prize and a $2OO dinner with an alumnus as the sec-ond-place prize. The spring 2012 week had a budget of $20,000 and featured multiple giveaways by the council. “The scavenger hunt was really fun and people liked it a lot,” Chloe Good, CC ’O6, one of the organizers of College Days that year said. “The reason we didn’t do it again was it was very logistically heavy.” CCSC canceled College Days in December that year, opting to use the money to host the Columbia Music Festival in the week leading up to the Bacchanal spring concert. Some students said that they would be interested in having special Core classes during the week. “I think it’s pretty obvious Columbia’s lacking in the spirit department,” Bryan Kao, CC ’lB, said. “Hopefully College Days will give us something to look forward to in the spring.” “College Days would deﬁnitely appeal to seniors because it’d be a refreshing recap of the Core,” Michael Schiff, CC ’l5, said. “Being a part of grade-wide CC lecture, for example, could be really interesting if they brought in a famous or iconic lecturer.” This year’s College Days ap- ' pears to be a shift away from previous years’ giveaway- driven events. ' Schiff said that he would like College Days to include largerscale events that could catch students’ attention. “It’d be really nice to see a grand display around campus or some type of performing arts entertainment on Low Steps,” he said. “The idea is to have a mix of active participation and passive events ‘ depending on the day, where you as a student are able to engage as much or as little as you’d want,” Ren said. dylan.cooper @coZumbiaspectator.com"
634,2 alternatives proposed for FroSci,13 November 2014,"BY MAIA BIX AND MALAYA SADLER Columbia Daily Spectator V Two possible replacements for the Frontiers of Science course may be ready for a test-drive With select students as early as next fall. A progress report emailed to Columbia College students by Dean James Valentini on Wednesday afternoon explained ‘that both proposed courses would replace the current lecture-and-seminar format With only seminars, but would differ in the focus of their content. The ﬂrst proposal takes achron—ological approach, covering topics starting with the origins of the universe and ending with human evolution. The second proposal focuses on scientiﬁc breakthroughs and uses them to contextualize the underlying concepts—much like the current course. Depending on an analysis of and feedback from the test classes, the school plans to replace the current Frontiers course with either one or a hybrid of both proposals. ' The progress report was created by the Committee on Sciencein the Core, which was formed in summer 2013 in response to the Educational Policy and Planning Committee’s evaluation of Frontiers of Science over the 201213 school year. EPPC recommended major changes to the course, including switching to a seminar format, which the Committee of Science in the Core was charged with assessing and implementing. b In this spirit, committee cochairs Peter deMenocal, an earth and environmental science professor, and Philip Kitcher, a philosophy professor, will be hosting an open forum to solicit feedback on Nov. 19 in Schermerhorn Hall, along with student committee members Violet Nieves, CC ’ls, and Ari Schuman, CC ’ls.DeMenocal and Kitcher were unavailable for comment on Wednesday. Valentini said in an email to Spectator that he is glad the committee’s work is progressing. ' “I know that they are looking forward to discussing their ideas for the Core science course with students hext week,” he said. ‘ The committee will develop a Model Seminars Program to help align the science coursewith Core Curriculum mainstays like Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, and solve the issue of having a single instructor teach a broad range of scientiﬁc topics. The program involves selecting successful Frontiers of Science section leaders to prepare sample seminar sessions for either proposed course. The section leaders Willthen train volunteers who have not previously taught a Frontiers course, and the trainees will present the seminar to the committee. If tlle Model Seminars Program is completed by the end of this academic year, an alternative course could be launched as early as fall 2015. A small number of students may then be able to opt into the experimental sections next fall, but most students will remain in the current Frontiers of Science course. Students interviewed on Wednesday agreed that the current Frontiers course must change, but were divided over the two proposals. “The current Frontiers ofScience curriculum is shallow and pedantic,” Nicola Douglas, CC ’lB, said. “To be honest, though, the other options look shallow and pedantic, as well. The current course does not go in depth enough, and I don’t agree with trying to make the course follow a historical narrative. We learn history in other ‘ classes.” Other students were more optimistic about the potential replacements. “I feel like the progression of building with a foundation that is relatively simple and moving on to more complex and later ideas brings about more discussion of human progress,” Helson l Taveras, CC ’lB and a Spectator web developer, said. “It raises bigger questions as you look at problems that humans struggled 1 with before, and what we struggle with today.” 1 “The class feels like it has , more of a purpose if it movesthrough time and has a narrative, like our other Core Curriculum classes,” Becca Teich, CC ’lB, said. Mark Flynn, CC ’lB, and Nina Mandracchia, CC ’lB, both said they favor the breakthroughs model. ' “I’m undecided, but I was looking into science majors, and it would be helpful to know about what’s going on today to help me decide upon what I want to study_-—to know what’s a prospective ﬁeld, what I can actually research,” Mandracchia said. “I think it would be the best to focus the course on more breakthroughs. I could not care any less about earth science, astrophysics—focus on what’s more realistic to scientiﬁc research today,” Flynn said. “Neuroscience relates to me. Biology relates to me. Breakthroughs matter to my future. The other topics don’t.” Annie Bryan contributed reporting. news@columbiaspectatoncomA NEW FRONTIER | Columbia College Dean James Valentini announced the proposed alternatives to the Frontiers of Science Core Curriculum course in an email to students on Wednesday."
635,Why everyone should be a bad feminist: An honest essay,5 March 2015,"This, reader, is an hon— /“ﬁg est essay. Michel de _ I Montaigne might not have w meant it when he compiled ’ "" C his own book of essays with I ( these W rds, tif ’ talked tcci me rtuall ihotllielioast EMI LY ' _B U R N 5 year, you’ve probably heard me. mention Roxane Gay in a rev- ANOV 3 '- erent tone. I might even have AP p roac [1 been jumping up and down _while I waxed rhapsodic. This, if nothing else, should show you that Imean it: In the past couple of decades, the essay has seen a dramatic revolution. Suddenly, everyone has a story to tell, and the essay—or creative nonfiction in general—offers a medium for these kinds of stories. In contrast to a book- A length memoir, an essay has to do a considerable amount of work in a short space. A book of essays, however, becomes its own beast with its own unique qualities. ‘ I With his “Essays,” Montaigne is said to have established the forerunner to the modern essay. His focus is far-reaching curiosity that examines topics like colonization, free will, and the ~ elusive search’ for happiness. This kind of essay is narrative-based, funny, sharp, and ultimately reaches a conclusion at the end of a few short pages. ~ ‘A modern-day Montaigne,‘ Roxane Gay-—who authored the essay collection “Bad Feminist: ‘Essays”—critiques and comments on modern American society in a way that is both rigorous and topical. Although her central focus is on race and gender relations, Gay makes incredible use of examples and reference points to - show how these topics are not simply restricted to classroom postcolonial approaches. Rather, they inﬂuence the social and political lives of millionsof Americans each day. H No issue is too small or too ‘ large for her to tackle, or for the reader to consider in a critical , way-—each example is symptomatic of larger problems, she p argues. ' I l ' Gay looks at sexual violence, female friendships, and “The Help” with the same gravity and, where appropriate, wise humor. No issue is too small or too large for her to tackle, or for the reader to consider in a critical way-—each example is symptomatic of larger problems, she argues. The title “Bad Feminist” refers to _ Gay’s ultimate stand in favor of feminism, but a feminism that is intersectional and ﬂexible to the lifestyles and choices of all women and those who identify as women. She might be a bad feminist according to some, but she “would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all.” In many ways, Gay is naturally following the path of the genre which Montaigne helped to establish, but reinvigorating and revitalizing it for a very different audience. She is the new voice for today’s generation, particularly for young women. Her voice becomes as familiar to the reader as that of an old friend, punctuated with the witty insight that we need when the going gets tough. At the same time, her voice is unreservedly compassionate—-she cares about everything she writes and, consequently, so does the reader. She persuades without lecturing and inspires new insight and curiosity in her readers. , Is Gay today’s Montaigne? It is very possible. Gay ultimately is performing the same acts of inquiry with the same wit and ﬂuidity of style, but in a way that modernizes the form to suit the present. Her arguments are entirely relevant to today’s world. And yet, we continue to read Montaigne in classes like Literature Humanities, while newer, more representative voices stay in the background. Arguments against including Roxane Gay . on the Lit Hum or Contemporary Civilization syllabi might cite fear of red tape and a fear of lengthening the book list beyond the capacity of even a formidable speed reader. So consider this an informal entreaty to consider Gay required reading for the new generation on everyone’s own time. She is the voice that Columbia University seeks so frequently to suppress through omission, in its Core and in its bureaucracy. Her arguments and her inquiries are our public responsibility. As Gay writes, “I am onewoman trying to make sense of this world we live in. I’m raising my voice to show all the ways we have room to want more, to do better.” We will not stop moving forward, but paying attention to the old voices and ignoring the new will keep us from wanting more and doing better. - Emily Burns is a Columbia College sophomore 1 ‘ majoring in English with concentrations in ‘ French and art history.

636,Our identities matter in Core classrooms,30 April 2015,"l , BY KAI JOHNSON, TANIKA LYNCH, ELIZABETH MONROE, AND TRACEY WANG M During a forum hosted by the Multicultural Affairs Advisory Board on Literature Humanities last semester, a student shared an experience with an audience of instructors and fellow students. This experience, she said, came to deﬁne her relationship to her Lit Hum class and to Core material in general. . V During the week spent on Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” the class was instructed to read the myths of Persephone and Daphne, both of which include vivid depictions of rape and sexual assault. As a survivor of sexual assault, the student described being triggered while reading such detailed accounts of rape throughout the work. However, the student said her professor focused on the beauty of the language and the splendor of the imagery when lecturing on the text. As a result, the student completely disengaged from the class discussion as a means of self—preservation. She did not feel safe in the class. When she approached her professor after class, the student said she was essentially dismissed, and her concerns were ignored. ‘ . Ovid’s “Metamorphoses” is a ﬁxture of Lit Hum, but lil§‘e so many texts in the Western canon,. it contains triggering and offensive material that marginalizes student identities in the classroom. These texts, wrought with histories and narratives of exclusion and oppression, can be difﬁcult to read and discuss as a survivor, a person of color, or a student from a low-income background: A. The MAAB, an extension of the Ofﬁce of Multicultural Affairs, is an advocacy group dedicated to ensuring that Columbia’s campus is welcoming and safe for students of all backgrounds. This year, we explored possible interventions in Core classrooms, where transgressions concerning student identities are common. Beyond the texts themselves, class discussions can disregard the impacts that the Western canon has had and continues to have on marginalized groups. ' For example, another student who attended the forum shared that her Lit Hum professor gave her class the opportunity to choose their own text to add to their syllabus for the year. When she suggested the class read~a Toni Morrison text, another student declared that texts by authors of the African Diaspora are a staple in most high school English classes, and therefore they did not need to reread them. Toni Morrison is a writer of both the African Diaspora and the Western World, and her novels—asid}e from being some of the most intellectually and emotionally compellingwriting in the last century——should be valued as founding texts of the Western canon. : ' The student’s remark regarding Toni Morrison was not merely insensitive, but also revealing of larger ideological divides. This would have been an opportune moment for the professor to intervene. , A L The MAAB has held two forums in our On the Core series and had multiple meetings with professor Roosevelt Montés, the director of the Center for the Core Curriculum. The goal of the forums on Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization was to give students, professors, and faculty a space to hold a safe and open dialogue about experiences in the classroom that all too often traumatize and silence students. Repeatedly, we heard from students who demonstrated that having difﬁcult experiences ina Lit Hum or Contemporary Civilization class may actually be part of the norm. Unfortunately, not all professors seem equipped to be effective facilitators in the classroom. Students need to feel safe in the classroom,_ and that requires a learning environment that recognizes the multiplicity of their identities. The MAAB has been meeting with administration and faculty in the Center for the Core Curriculum to determine how to create such a space. The Board has recommended three measures: First, we proposed that the center issue a letter to faculty about potential trigger . warnings and suggestions for how to support triggered students. Next, we noted that there should be a mechanism for students to communicate their concerns to professors anonymously, as well as a mediation mechanism for students who have identity-based disagreements withprofessors. Finally, the center should create a training program for all professors, including faculty andigraduate instructors, which will enable them to constructively facilitate conversations that embrace all identities, share best practices, and think critically about how the Core Curriculum is framed for their students. . Our vision for this training is not to infringe upon the instructors’ academic freedom in teaching the material. Rather, it is a means of providing them with effective strategies to engage with potential conflicts and confrontations in the classroom, whether they are between students or in response to the material itself. Given these tools, professors will be able to aid in the inclusion of student voices which presently feel silenced. Students at the forum expressed that they have felt that Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization’s curricula are often presented as a set of universal, venerated, incontestable principles, and texts that have founded Western society. Such a presentation does not allow room for their experiences in the Western world or inclass discussions. While these founding principles have been liberating in many ways, instructors should more consistently acknowledge during class discussions that many of these same principles have created an unjust, unequal, and oppressive existence for many, as Professor Montas has suggested during our forums. One of the deﬁning elements of a Columbia education is the Core. The Center for the Core Curriculum, professor Montas, and many instructors have been receptive to our feedback and expressed dedication to addressing these issues. Altering the Core Curriculum is another important discussion—one that would undoubtedly require the insight of the larger student body. In the meantime, we hope that our recommendations will enable students to have a more intellectually rewarding experience in their classrooms, The authors are members of the Multicultural Affairs Advisory Board.

637,Literature Humanities may be getting a new syllabus in the fall semester,30 April 2015,"C BY J. CLARA CHAN :_-_‘ Spectator Senior Staff Writer . Students taking Columbia’s . Literature Humanities course i next fall may be getting a revised syllabus on the ﬁrst day of class. Though revisions are not yet ﬁnal, Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” Goethe’s “Faust,” and the Book of Job will likely be removed from the syllabus, while the addition of Sappho’s poetry, Euripides? “Bacchae,” Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” a Shakespeare play to be ’ determined later, Boccaccio’s “The Decameron,” and one late 20th-century or early 21st-cen-tury work has received large faculty support, according to Chairwoman of Literature Humanities Julie Crawford. ' In addition to these changes, Virgil’s “Aeneid” and Ovid’s IfMetamorphoses,’{ which are currently. studied at the beginning of the spring semester, will be studied at the end of the fall semester. The spring semester will instead begin with the New Testament. ' The revised syllabus still needs to go through a ﬁnal round of voting by the entire Lit Hum faculty, which will occur online, before it is ﬁnalized. Once a consensus has been reached, Crawford said that the next steps will include ordering the books and ensuring that all of the Lit Hum instructors——who will have to adjust their respective_ syllabi—are aware of the changes. Crawford said that these potential, changes have resulted from recommendations from several Lit Hum faculty members. “We solicited input from the last three years of Lit Hum instructors about what has‘ worked in the class, what hasn’t worked, what they’d like to keep, what they’d like to change,” Crawford said. “We had two‘ two-hour {meetings in which we talked about the most recommendedthings of the instructor. We had about 40 to 50 reports from instructors, so it was a lot.” In addition to faculty feed“back, Crawford said that she read through thousands of student evaluations to gauge student response to texts. Though a ﬁnal decision has not yetbeen made on the late 20th-century or early 21stcentury text for the .course, Crawford said that her subcommittee will create a short list of all the works suggested by faculty members, which will then be released alongside the other proposed changes to the syllabus for the entire Lit Hum faculty to vote on. “We’ve hadiover -10 suggestions, and to come up with a short list, there’s a lot of pressure on that,” Crawford said. “I think everybody’s going to have to be really conscious and not overdetermining it.” “Even if I was born in the West...there’s no place for me in the intellectual, the artistic history of . it.” > —-Nihal Shetty, CC Adjunct associate English and comparative literature professor Richard Sacks, who teaches a section of Lit Hum, said that the syllabus revision was naturally a complicated process because of the interrelated nature of the texts, but that he Was strongly in favor of adding a more modern work. Crawford said that there was a consensus among the faculty that the additional text should be a shorter work, given the breadthof the rest of the syllabus. ‘ Among the suggestions, works by Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, and SuzanLori Parks have frequently appeared, according to Crawford. Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel “Maus” has also received a large amount of faculty support. “There are pretty much as ' many suggestions as there are faculty,” Crawford said. Italian and Core Curriculum A lecturer Akash Kumar, who serves on the subcommittee that will create the short list, said that he believes the more modern work’ is a crucial addition to the Lit Hum syllabus. “The consideration [of the late 20th-century or early 21stcentury Work] is something that really speaks to the here and now, that speaks to students’ contemporary concerns, and has the voice that’s recognizablecto them, as well as a voice that is different to them because they’ve gone through the Lit Hum experience and they’re looking at it in a different Way,” Kumar said. Students and faculty members said that these contemporary concerns, as Kumar describedthem, have come from the increasingly complicated deﬁnition of what the Western canon is and should be. i For Nihal Shetty, CC ’lB, who. plans to major in comparative literature and society, his experience taking Lit Hum left him with a sense of disconnect. ' “There came a point for me, halfway through my ﬁrst semester, somewhere right about when we hit Plato’s ’Symposium’ and this huge gloriﬁcation of Western aestheticism, that I almost couldn’t take it anymore,” Shetty said in an email. “I was tired of having to work twice as hard as my white peers to forge a connection with these books that are supposed to be‘ a foundation of our society, tired of being constantly reminded that even if I was born in the West, even if the West is all I’ve known, there's no place for me in the intellectual, the artistic history of it.” Kumar said that he sympathizes with students’ concerns about the syllabus being heavily ' dominated by white European male authors. "" “I’m an Indian American from Hawaii, so you know, that’s deﬁnitely not part of my makeupeither,” Kumar said. “I think that a lot more can be done, even in terms of the way that we teach the texts that are already there in complicating the notion of what it is that we refer to when we think of a dead white man. It’s a little more complicated than that.” l “But I think that there are great gestures that are being made toward complicating that in the suggestion of formally including Sappho, for example, in the fall semester,” he added. _ “For obvious reasons, there’s never going to be consensus. Everybody has their darlings and everybody has their ‘nos.’ They’re the people who are like, ’The point of this course is overwhelming-copia,’ like you justget ﬂooded with these major and amazing things, and » then the other people are like, ’No, it would be better to do half as much but for twice as long,”’ Crawford said. “There’s certainly some big ' changes that are proposed, but I think they deserve a chance and they could really turn it into an even better experience than it already is,” Kumar said. news@columbiaspectatoncomCHANGES IN THE LIT HUM SYLLABUS"
638,Do trigger warnings belong in the Core?,8 October 2015,"Some students believe Core texts containoffensive materialBY KELLY FAN A Spectator Senior Staff Writer First—years enrolled in Literature Humanities will be reading Toni Morrison’s “Song of Solomon” for the first time next spring. The text, added last June,-will be the first on the syllabus written by a person of color. . The addition comes at a time of heightened concern about identity-based challenges in the Core Curriculum and has prompted a broader conversation about how concerns about diversity should be addressed, including a proposal to add trigger warnings to Core texts. \ ‘ In April, several former members of the Multicultural Affairs Advisory Board, an undergraduate board within the Office of Multicultural Affairs which aims to promote inclusivity on campus, published an op-ed in Spectator calling for a “learning environment that recognizes the multiplicity” of student identities. The'op-ed criticizes Core texts for containing “trigger- A ing and offensive material that marginalizes student identities in the classroom.” A number of students, including Tracey Wang, CC ""15 and one of the authors of the op-ed», feel that instruction in _ Core classes need to be more sensitive to concerns relat— C ing to student identities and ensuring that students from historically marginalized backgrounds feel welcome in classrooms through measures 4 such as trigger warnings. _ Increasing the number of texts written by diverse, authors alone, according to Wang, is not an improvement if the instruction of those texts is not careful and nuanced. “A guy in my class was talking to me about the book and how it was excessive, and how it was just there because she was a woman,” she said in June. “I’m kind of horrifiedthat these kinds of conversations might be brought up with Toni Morrison as well, and if instructors aren’t prepared, students are going to leave with this mindset of ‘Oh, she’s just there because we needed a black author on the syllabus.”’ One possible way to address concerns about diversity is to ensure that current Core texts are taught in a way that challenges and complicates existing notions that have been drawn from them. 66 9 I don t want people tothink [Morrison] simply being there is enough.” a i -—Tracey Wang CC ’l5, former member of MAAB “I don’t want people to think [Morrison] simply being there is enough, and then not ” delve into the work as a beginning of a dialogue about inclusion and other issues of diversity and identity on campus,” Wang added. “I want a Core that teaches the texts we have in a critical and radical Way, in a way that is informed by historical oppressions that have happened to make these books as powerful and foundational as they’re held up to be now.” Farah Griffin, a Morrison scholar and a former Lit Hum- _ instructor, points out that _ the Western canon itself is shaped by and is a product of instruction. ' “Herodotus was not writing about a world that was ever white. The Greeks are very clear abouta world where Africa exists, where Asia exists,” she said in June. “We’ve been taught to read them as kind of the greatest thatWestern society has to offer, and that the best and greatest have been produced by men who thought of themselves as white men. And some of those men didn’t even think of themselves or know that they were i white men. It’s a construct that happened after them.” Roosevelt Montas, director of the Center for the Core Curriculum, said that framing difficult topics in a conscientious manner is the critical responsibility of the instructor. “I do think the conversation that should be had with faculty, and is being had with faculty, is how do you treat sensitive material in the classroom,” Montas said. “Because you can do it well, and you can do it poorly, and part of your job as a teacher is to do it well.” According to Julie Crawford, the chair of Lit Hum, instructors undergo a variety of trainings in order to effectively teach challenging material, including ‘a rigorous orientation for new instructors on a myriad of pedagogical issues and weekly expert lectures to discuss upcoming texts. Still, some have raised concerns about their experiences with instructors.,ln the fall of 2014, the MAAB held’ a roundtable called “On the Core—Student Identities and Experiences in Lit Hum,” inviting students to share experiences of gender and racial marginalization in Lit Hum with instructors. A similar forum was held fo'r'CC students and faculty in the spring semester. Following the first On the Core forum, members of the MAAB met with Montas five times last semester to “continue the conversation surrounding how to support studentsfrom a variety of backgrounds so that they may feel safe and welcomed in their Core classes.” Current MAAB members did not respond to requests for comment. “They [the MAAB members] had specific occasions i in the classroom that, if you take the way they were reported as an accurate representation, were handled very poorly by instructors,” Montas said. “In all these issues these topics came up in ‘a way that was insensitive or in a way that was offensive. We talked about what these issues Were, We talked about how_ faculty are trained.” ‘ . “These conversations were very good and very useful,” Montas said. “What makes a Core class work is the student engagement and the possibility of genuine, honest, open dialogue. If that is not happening for a group of students for whatever reason, then the Core is not happening.” Some feel that trigger warnings can foster a learning environment more sensitive to identity-based challenges. Tanika Lynch, CC ’l5 and a co-author of the op-ed criticizing Core instruction, said that she would like to see trigger Warnings applied to Core syllabi to alert students of sensitive topics that might be disturbing to those belonging to«marginal—ized groups and who have had traumatizing experiences. “Even saying ‘trigger Warning’ automatically elicits a lot of different opinions,” Lynch said in June. “But it just means that as we re ad them [the texts], we have a context around what it is that we’rereading, that people feel’ safe While in the classroom, because at the end of the day, what you get out of your educational experience largely depends on how safeyou feel in the classroom.” As students’ calls for trigger warnings incited national concern about censorship and hypersensitivity, Montas said that faculty members have never discussed the use of trigger warnings on Core syllabi “as a possibility.” C “The Core classroom is going to be a place where you encounter ideas that you disagree with, you will encounter ideas you might even find offensive,” Montas said. “The notion of trigger warnings has always felt to be a threat to something very fundamental that’s supposed to happen in the Core classroom.” For Crawford, the place to attend to psychological difficulties is outside the classroom, such as Disability Services or Counseling and Psychological Services. ' “[The discussion-based classroom] is not the same thing as therapy. It’s not the same thing as friendship,” Crawford said in June. “It’s a place of rigorous intellectual inquiry done in the spirit of good citizenship and good community.” However, ""some students feel that the principles behind trigger warnings have value—even if there is the danger of taking trigger warnings too far. “If you’re someone who has gone through a traumatic experience, and there is something that on a deep psychological level, if you read it and see it, could trigger a very unpleasant reaction, then I understand the merit behind it,” Kyle Dontoh, CC ’l6, said. “But [sometimes trigger warnings] go beyond things that could i bring up certain psychological traumas, to getting perni- _ ciously close to opinions that aren’t deemed acceptable.” The danger of this, Dontoh , .feels, is that this can restrict the debate surrounding a text, limiting the conversation to a “range of accepted opinions.” “When you start putting up Warnings that say things like, ‘This is a misogynistic text,’ you’re making a value statement. You’re making everyone start from the Viewpoint * of ‘Okay, this is a misogynistic text, and I have to therefore approach it as a misogynistictext,’ rather than approaching it as a text and then finding that there are sexist things in it.” > ‘ c Montas said that the challenge of teaching difficult subject matter has been and always be a concern of the Core curriculum. A \ “These are ‘not issues that are new, and they’re not issues that will go away—that today, we’re going to find amagic formula that will address them and settle them,” Montas said. “No, they are issues that areperpetual in the nature of what we’re doing, and it’s appropriate that they be so. They’re issues that We ’ tal_k about and will continue to talk about with respect and engaging with students who are experiencing that poorly.” A ' kellyfan @columbiaspectato'r.comNEW READS | Toni Morrison’s “Song of Solomon” was added to the Literature Humanities syllabus last June.

639,The unpredictability of what is triggering in the classroom,8 October 2015,"‘ BY JULIE CRAWFORD ‘ Triggers, for those who have been traumatized, often have an oblique relationship to the originating trauma and move across the Whole range of sensory plains. For one person, it is loud noises; for another, the smell of gasoline; for another, snow. These cannot be planned for or prevented, so they are instead managed through a range of practices. Among the things that have triggered strong reactions in my classrooms over 15 years of teaching, including (although rarely) symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, are: Augustine’s despair over the death of his friend in the words, “I carried my lacerated and bloody soul when it was pnwilling to be carried by me. I found no place where I could ""put, it down;” Cam’s statement _in To the Lighthouse that she would not “give a ﬂower to the gentleman;” the moment in Pride and Prejudice where Lady Catherine de Bourgh tells Elizabeth Bennett she could use the piano in the back room where she won’t “be in anyone’s way.” Sometimes I am privy to what was triggered; usually I am not. In each of the cases described above, great conversations ensued and brilliant papers resulted. it These kinds of experiences cannot be planned for nor warned ""against, as the range of things students have experienced are almost inﬁnitely varied, and—this is crucial~—because the things that affect them most in a given class, or text, or conversation, or moment, often have an oblique relationship to any trauma :they may have experienced. When I was 19, I was stunned stupid reading John Donne’s “The Relic” in a 17th-century poetry class. (I was, quite literally, unable to speak for the rest of the day.) In this poem the speaker imagines a future digger of his grave site spying “a bracelet of bright hair about the bone” of {the speaker’s arm. This line lit up, in a kind of poetic spotlight, a range of experiences I’d less forgotten about than never really felt the weight of before. That image eventually became both a psychic talisman and a crucible of a scholarly life, but at the time it was quite simply paralyzing. V John Milton had a different effect on me when I first read his work around the same time: “He for God only, she for God in him.” That line reached its claws _out at me, and I reached back at it with all the rage of a newly-feminist consciousness. I combed Milton's work, finding in it the traces of a discourse—a way of thinking—that I was trying to fight my way out of. HatingMilton with a White-hot passion became the project of my third semester in college. My response was not only an intellectual response, but also a life-saving response——the response of a particular person with particular life experiences in a particular time and place. My Milton professor was smart enough to know I’d come back. And I did, to this: “I cannot praise a fugitive and cloister’d vertue, unexercis’d and unbreath’d, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race, where immortal garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat.” One encounter with the text had tapped into a personal trauma, the other into one I shared in only obliquely. , The first year I taught Milton at Columbia was at the very beginning of the U.S.-led military intervention in Afghanistan, which came to be called Operation Enduring Freedom. When I got to the scene in the war in Heaven where Satan comes in with his weapons of mass destruction, “Training his devilish Enginrie, impal’d/On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,/To hide the fraud,” and says, “Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;/That all may see who hate us, how we seek/Peace,” I was stunned to find myself paralyzed in much the same way as I had been when I first read “The. Relic” some 15 years earlier. One encounter with the text had tapped into a personal trauma, the other into one I shared in only obliquely. Neither reaction was predictable or preventable, and neither was, in any way, regrettable. I was not the only one in that lecture hall deeply affected by Milton’s words, written in 1667, on that day in 2001. - Students and their teachers encounter the things they are reading and discussing both in the present and with their own pasts. They encounter them—if they are lucky, as we are at Columbia—with people from different countries, political systems and beliefs, socioeconomic and familial backgrounds, gender expressions and sexualities, religious beliefs and ethical convictions, ethnic and racial identities, languages, and personal histories. I have observed dozens of individual Lit Hum classesand talked with dozens of instructors and students (there are 64 sections a semester and 1,206 students a year) and have seen and heard of a staggering array of encounters between students and texts, students and students, students and instructors: students for whom Helen is a trope and students for Whom she is a trauma; students for Priam and students for Hecuba; devout students truly shocked by the casual blasphemy of their peers; newly secular (or “recovering”) students struggling to countenance the religious dogmas of others; students from former communist countries talking with students excited by the communitarian fantasies and theories in a given text; first-genera-tion college students trying to develop a relationship with the unfamiliar jargon of their more specialized-discourse-wielding peers; students with White-hot rage against Virgil’s imperialism debating with students enthralled by his subversiveness; students from war zones bemused by their American peers’ skepticism about intervention; students for whom a scene or a statement expressed in a text is somehow transparent to a social reality or the author’s personal views debating those for whom the same view or- statement means something else entirely. There are “many nouns thatapply to our students (and their teachers, for that matter): orphans and survivors, activists and depressives, conservatives and optimists, ethnographers and believers, future—thinkers and keepers-of-the-ﬂame. There are also a fantastic array of adjectives, both proudly blazoned and held in secret, that marshal those nouns into beingand doing: sober and disordered, traumatized and anxious, skeptical and keen, contentious and conciliatory, guarded and open, righteous and quiet and curious. But mostly we get to do verbs: read, think, talk, listen, debate, experiment, hypothesize, create, try, rethink, reconsider. Despite his deep love for books, Milton was much less interested in books than in verbs: “Whatever thing we hear or see,” he wrote in Areopagitica, “Sitting, walking, travelling, or conversing may be fitly call’d our book, and is of the same effect-that writings are.” Classrooms are part of this gerund-y approach to the world, not separate from it, and what happens in them is wholly unpredictable-even with books and ideas that are thousands of years old.

640,Boyce renews spirit at SEAS,29 October 2015,"New InltlatlVes, faculty hll'€S school Spectator Senior Staff Writer Two and a half years into her tenure, School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean Mary Boyce has brought renewed en- t ergy to the school, sparking the"" creation of a series of initiatives that has reanimated both faculty and students. ' Columbia trumpeted Boyce’s appointment as a high-pro-ﬁle hire in March 2013 after the University stole Boyce away from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where ‘ she had taught for over 25 years. Her appointment marked the end of a Volatile decade for SEAS, following former Dean ' Feniosky Peﬁa-Mora’s resignation after SEAS faculty passed a vote of “no conﬁdence” in him. Her appointment helped put SEAS on the map, according to Robert McCaughey, a history professor at Barnard and the author of “A Lever Long Enough: A History of Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science Since 1864.” “She is an important person in her discipline, coming fromthe top engineering school in the. world, a member of the National Academy of Engineering. She came in with instant impact in terms of the visibility of the institution,” Mccaugheyésaid. “And then from everything I hear, she’s "" performed as expected.” ' According to administrators, faculty and students inter- » viewed by Spectator, Boyce has successfully fostered interdis- ' ciplinary collaboration with the other schools at the University, S authorizeda series of signiﬁcant renovations, and worked to emphasize to students how exciting engineering is. “I think Columbia missed a coupleof turns in the wheel , when engineering was revived in the ‘6os and ‘7os, and places like MIT and Stanford re- . ally took advantage of them and Columbia kind of fumbled along,” McCaughey said. “This round, I think Columbia has moved as smartly as any.” _ I TRANSCENDING DISCIPLINES A central tenet of Boyce’s vision is to enable engineering students and faculty to tackle _ the “global challenges of the ‘ world” through interdisciplinary work. “We’re looking now that our engineering education is a foundational education,” Boyce said. ’ “At the undergraduate level, we do consider a key part of that [to be] our requirement of a part of the core curriculum, because we think that also informs the broader perspectiveof our role in the world, and how engineeringcomes to bear on that.” Engineering students * at Columbia are required to take half of the humanities core; they choose between Literature Humanities, ‘ Contemporary Civilization, or V two Global Core courses, and either Art Humanities or Music Humanities. The approach is one that Boyce believes distinguishes SEAS from its peers and appeals to. students who value interdisciplinary collaboration. V “We are attracting students who seeengineering in that foundational way,” Boyce said. “So I do think we attract anincredible talent that is broader than what you mightsee in some other top engineering schools.” V 4 .According to McCaughey, Boyce’s interest in pursuing interdisciplinary work is the_ continuation of work that administrators at SEAS began in the 19905. . ' ' “I don’t think [the emphasis on transdisciplinary collaboration] can be attributed to the most recent clean, but I think what Dean Boyce. has ' recognized is that that is one . of the key elements in the perceived success of_ the institution and engineering school,” McCaughey, said. “And I think it’s now the case that you cannot , think seriously of any collaboration within the University that does not include the engineering school.” i According to Soulaymane Kachani, senior vice dean for academic programs at SEAS, past administrators had also hoped to foster interschool, collaboration, but there was “nothing that was meaningful that came with that” “until Boyce came to campus. “She came here and said,‘ ‘We have to ""cross to all the schools, to all the disciplines, and see where we can add value,”’ Kachani said. “It’s not like we ' weren’t doing that before, [but] I donit think we were doing it in an organized way.” One of the most notable ex— ’ amples of this visionhas been‘ the creation of the Ebola design challenge in 2014. The challenge, which spanned the . course’ of two weeks, tasked participants from SEAS and the Mailman School of Public Health to work in teams to develop a low—cost, technology- » driven -solution that would meet a challenge‘ posed by’ the outbreak of Ebola. The chalv lenge sparked‘ the creation of Highlight, a powdered bleach additive that can beused to decontaminate infectious diseases. The invention won the USAID Fighting ‘Ebola Grand » ‘Challenge and has sincebeen r incorporated into the New York City Fire Department’s HazMat unit decontamination protocol. ' r Boyce, who created the event after discussing the Ebola crisiswith Mailman School of Public Health Dean Linda Fried, herself participated in the challenge, serving as a research adviser. .. . _ Ritish Patnaik,’ SEAS ’l6, A praised the event, and noted that it allowed him to work with Boyce not in the capacity of anadministrator, but as a researcher. . “I came to the Ebola design challenge kickoff presentation, and I was interested‘ in the idea . of protective suits. The next day, . Dean Boyce is sitting there, and she’s sketching out a suit, and I had a sketch‘ of a suit in my backpack, and we sat down and started compiling our sketches , and working together,” Patnaik said. . “She would take time out of her day to come down to the BME [biomedical engineering] ‘ lab just to see how things were going, to see‘ if she could give us advice,” he added. Boyce also has worked to collaborate with the Business School, spearheading the? creation of a new class called . Research to Revenue-, which will be offered to business and engineering students in the first V half of sprilngsyemester. The course will encourage students to work in teams to tackle both -the technical and entrepreneur- . ial challenges of developing technology. ‘ . » “Something Dean Boyce v wants to do is not just think, about these ideas, but really do them. And that’s why we are offering this as soon as possible, not waiting until next year,” Sam Sia, an associate professor of biomedical engineering who is helping to craft the course, said. “We want to"",d9_.-,_it now “and we want to giveiiltlsltadents resources now.” I a . INVESTMENTS IN FACULTY AND SPACE Perhaps the largest challenge facing SEAS‘ that Boyce habislought to tackle has been I ' the school’s space constraints. »Crunch_ed for laboratory space, faculty and students havehistorically felt the coiggequences of Columbia’s spaéellimitations acutely. This probl3ﬁ%*that has directly affected tl3l:el'school’s V ability to competitively recruit faculty.*""‘lt’s a limiting factor. You want to be able to do your research, and you need to have the space to do your research. It’s probably how you’re going to A get tenure,” David Vallancourt, . a senior lecturer in circuits and systems in the department of electrical engineering, said. ' But under Boyce’s leadership, SEAS has invested in a series of renovations, expanding S and refurbishing lab and ofﬁce spaces. ‘ . = ' “We’re undergoing some rathermassive renovations to build out and bring more labs up to the level we need to be at for the type of work we’re doing. That’s a major priority of the school,” Boyce said. “We have a big effort to try to bring our current spaces up to , the level where I think we need ‘ to be.” ‘ g A A Those construction proj-« ects have included renovations to biomedical engineering and electrical engineering teaching labs, the creation of an ' electron microscopy labora- . tory, and the creation of 8,400 square feet of faculty office space, conference rooms, and i open areas for research collaboration and meetings for the Data Science Institute. SEAS has also been. allot- . ted a plotof land on the new . Manhattanville campus. “She has the passion to crev ate not only physical space that satisfies ‘faculty need, but . she thinks about ‘how do we, make it long term and beneﬁcial and sustainable and efﬁcient,”’ SEAS Senior Executive Vice Dean Shih-Fu Chang said. “When you. create a space, it makes sense to invest a little more today so you can later on use this infrastructure.” . The investments in creating laboratory and ofﬁce space have also facilitated an increase in faculty hires—-22 new faculty members have joined SEAS in .i the past year‘ alone: ' '1 ""“lsean""B""oyee has».deﬁnite'ly~ made hiring of world class faculty a priority}? Garud Iyengar, the chair of the industrial engineering and operations research department, wrote in an email, “lEOR has added four new faclrulty since she arrived on campus. This is approximately a 20 percent increase in the facultyS count. And we are looking to hire two more faculty members this year.” According to Kachani, the expansion in faculty hires is . indicative of the dynamic vision Boyce brought with her to ’ SEAS. . “She came and she said, ‘We’ have to be a lot more risk taking. So instead of growing modestly over many years, let’s make ‘bold movement of growing the school from _a faculty side, enhancing. our structure and we will ﬁgure it out,”’ Kachani said. “To be honest, previous deans would not have done what Mary has done. They would have done it at a slower pace.” A r MAKING ENGINEERING EXCITING A V ' For decades, aperception ex- . isted that SEAS did not receive the recognition it deserved . within the University, with former dean ZviGalil once de- A scribing it as an “adopted child.” “I think Columbia has taken. ' a very long time to recognize the‘ importance of an applied science component to a real university,” McCaughey said. “Now that’s totally gone.” . But even as thelschool has ireclleivedlgreater recognition, Boyce is still working to distinguish the school, emphasiz- . ing to both SEAS students and members of the University community that engineering is “an incredible ﬁeld to be in.” V . “We want to really celebrate the incredible projects students do as part of their curr_iculum and to really-open that up to the entire Columbia community to see what great things our students are doing,” Boyce said.‘ To fostenexcitement, Boyce revamped the annual schoolS wide senior design exposition that showcases the culmination of graduating seniors’ work. Once a series of small, informal "" departmental events, Boyce created a single school-wide event in Lerner‘ Hall to highlight the V ‘sen=_iors"" designs andlinvited the public to attend.‘ I “The expo was something we talked about off andlon for quite some time «but she re-A ally got behind it and made it happen,” Vallancourt said. “It serves the purpose of making engineering more obvious to the rest of the community. Withouther support, I don’t know that it would have happened.” i V For students like Robert Ying, SEAS ’l6 andia Spectator editorial board member, another key initiative Boyce led was r the creation of the Makerspace, 650 square feet of open lab space students can access to pursue independent research and projects. V “It’s very hard to make a value judgement that says, ‘ls it worth losing a classroom in exchange for having another open lab for students?’ But she made that value judgment, and I think it’s the right one,” Ying said. _“I haven’t seen the classr room crunch getting worse, and in exchange we have a space A that’s open on students’ sched- . ule. It’s had pretty much constant usage.” V . Ying also cited the Extreme ' Engineering series as an exV ample of Boyce’s work to bring engineering to the forefront of the university. The lecture _ series, which kicked off this September,.has brought NASA s engineers and arctic explorers to campus with the goal of exposing students to exciting and radical jobs irrengineering. »“It ‘Wasn’t just. engineering students——peopleicame because it was cool,” Ying said. “That’s the kind of thing that - excites people and I think that has helped, because engineering has often been forgotten on campus,” E T ‘ Professor of. profession- ' al practice in the mechanical engineering department and former astronaut. Mike Massimino, who has helped to lead Extreme Engineering, said that Boyce’s vision for the series mirrors her passion for engineering and ‘her larger vision for the school. a E “I think she has thisvision "" that engineering is supposed ‘ to be fun, it's supposed to be exciting,” ‘Massimino said. (“You probably didn't become . an engineer becausé""‘yoil'want to solve differential equations.

641,"3 years later, no set plan for science Core",19 November 2015,"Proposed course to replace Fronteirs mired in criticism ’_‘ ~ BY KELLY FAN Spectator Senior Staff Writer _ After a yeariof silence on the state of a new science Core course V that ‘could replace Frontiers of Science, Columbia College Dean James Valentini emailed all Columbia College students a proposal for the new coursecalled The Rough Guide to the Universe—onWednesday evening. Frontiers is a.semester—long science course that all ﬁrst-year A Columbia College students are required. to-take. Since its creation. the course come. intense scrutiny con-y iﬁﬁuédit¢fiticism—paliti¢i¥larly.for ‘ ' failiiig?to‘nieet the vsameistaiidardis as other Core classes, especially ' Contemporary Civilizations and Literaturee Humanities. F - V ‘ \. after three years of review, T no'ﬁnal.i-decision has been made A about whether or not to pursue the implementation of a new science ’ Core class—a.process that would take years to complete. In the meantime, thousands of students will continue to take Frontiers, as faculty and administrators continue to question and debate the ’ merits of both classes. l . This semester marks the third year since Valentini tasked the Educational Planning and Policy Committee—a group of faculty that coordinates educational policy in the Arts and Sciences—vvith reviewing Frontiers. An EPPC V subcommittee conducted a yearlong reviewof the course,»initiating .a lengthy process developing a course which has passed from committee to committee over the past few years—and which will i take at least another two years to complete. 3 _ i In a conﬁdential report—obtained and published by Spectator in June 2013—the EPPC subcom- \ rnittee recommended a series of signiﬁcant changes to the Core , science class, including the elimi- ' nation of lectures in favor of smallgroup seminars’ similar to those of Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilizations. The EPPC report sparked debate on the V quality of the course, and following ’its analysis, Valentini formed the Corrrmittee on Science in the Core, a seventeen-person group of facfulty and students charged with . developing a potential alternative , Core science course. a ' Since the creation of the EPPC p report, momentum had stalled, according to Jim Applegate, a professor of astronomy who served informally on the Committee on A Science in the Core- -- “Aristotle’s, law of inertia t¢rest,”Appl¢gate -i,“And ’¢>§p.¢°i it’s a ‘il6iid' diiéito get it The Committee on Science the Core took’ two years to com:,'- .

' V Spectator obtained this report and informed Valentini in an interview with Valentini on Tuesday that it would be published on Thursday. « is Y: . In that intewie'w,?L""‘Valentini declined to comment on the contents of the report because it was marked conﬁdential. _ “When we’re developing anything new, the ﬁrst stages really are to keep the ‘discussion within a group of people‘ who have been chartered with the responsibility of trying to develop it,” Valentini told Spectator. “That’s not unusual, that’s not atypical. That’s prettymuch what we do with anything.” - However, Valentini emailed a revised version of the report to Columbia College students the following day. V r T AROUGH GUIDE The proposal for RGU as a potential alternative toFrontiers relies upon a guiding principle set forth by the EPPC review of Frontiers: a Core science course should be structured similarly to other seminar courses in the Corecurriculum. ' I ’ RGU proposes eliminating Frontiers’ course-wide lectures in favor of a seminar-onlytformat ' in which students engage primary texts, chosen to highlight scientific breakthroughs, in small group discussions. ‘ ' The changes also seek to address criticisms raised against Frontiers by students and faculty, which were identiﬁed in the EPPC review. ' A A For instance, to address ‘criticisms that Frontiers lacks coherence, the proposal seeks to provide narrative coherence through v_ a chronological organization: topics will sweep from the “origins of the universe to the emergence of animals with large brains and complex psychological traits” and “end - by considering the ways in which those animals have brought about signiﬁcant changes in the planet on which they have evolved.” V But three years since the EPPC’s review, Columbia College _ . is far from implementing a pilot course that addresses longstanding student and faculty concerns—and no decision has even been made to pursue the development of a pilot ’ at all. h Additionally, many faculty members, particularly those who have been involved with the development and instruction of Frontiers, have cast doubt on several key components of. the proposal. - 9 , ' ‘ Nicholas Christie-Blick, a former co-chair of Frontiers, said that “this plan hasn’t got aprayer of succeeding, based on our experience_trying to teach Frontiers.” Science faculty interviewed by Spectator questioned whether a general education science course could be taught effectively through primalv text readings Bob Cave, a professor of chemistry at Harvey Mudd College who served as an external expert consultant to the EPPC, said that such texts would be inaccessible to ﬁrstyears. . “You can read the words, but unless you have access to the mathematics, it can be like reading a dead language,” he said. “For example, the paper that Einstein developed——the genesis’ of special relativity—it’s not-clear to me that the average person is going to be able to pick it up and say, ‘Oh, I totally get what he was talking about.’” ' ' Using primary literature to teach a Core science course is not an original idea. Professor of astronomy David Helfand, who taught two,different iterations of a Core science course inthe 1980s, cited the use of primary texts as a key failure. “We’ve tried it in two completely different context points and it’s failed both times,” Helfand said. “That doesn’t mean We’re all ‘ knowing. But I’ve done enough ” experiments that I’m satisﬁed that it doesn’t work.’’ i But Stuart Firestein, a professor of biological sciences who participated in an experimental model ' seminar conducted in the spring to test the proposal, disagreed. “I think it is possible. to take classical papers and then prepare a commentary about them,” V Firestein——a former Frontiers instructor and the co-chair of the EPPC committee that reviewed Frontiers—sa_id. “I personally believe that’s more engaging, because it allows you to present not only the -paper itself, but the history behind it.” ‘_ ' i . For Applegate, the use of prima- ' ry texts could help the proposed 4 course to overcome‘ a longstanding V challenge posed by Frontiers. “One of the problems with Frontiers is that it’s too easy for the scientists and too hard for the non—scientists,” Applegate said. “It manages to miss both groups _of students. One way to make the course more interesting for [both groups of] students... is to read primary texts.” . ‘ Philip Kitcher, a philosophyprofessor who co-chaired the committee that drafted RGU, feels that despite these doubts, having a stable syllabus of texts will beneﬁt the course by lesseningthe burden placed on instructors who have to learn new material year after year. “It’s relatively more stable, and A I think that will help,” he said. “It may turn out in the end that David Helfand and Nicholas ChristieBlick are right and the texts don’t work, and the instructors ﬁnd it_ just terribly burdensome. But I think it’s surely worth giving it a go, given the success of CC and Lit Hum. You always have to remember, it took a while to get those courses going too.” ‘ Other faculty stressed that eliminating the ‘course—wide lecture component from Frontiers, as recommended by the EPPC, would be a critical mistake. l “I think those big lectures are really important,” Cave said. “There was something beautiful and unique about those large lectures that can’t possibly be capturedin a seminar format” According to Christie-Blick, the expert lectures serve as vital context, without which students . would have great difﬁculty under- _ standing the material. Eliminating the lectures would therefore be‘ problematic, especially because seminar leaders would have to teach outside their ﬁeld of study without the lecture to refer back to. V “Now you’ve got these things that look like seminars, but now the seminar leader is doing the lecturing because the fact is, none of the students know what’s going on,” Christie-Blick said. i Kitcher, however, who formerly chaired CC, feels that there are pedagogical beneﬁts to the discus-sion-based course that RGU could take advantage of. j‘ ' “I came away [from chairing CC] thinkingthatvirtuallyallofthe people I saw leading sections— although they didn’t always get the details right, although they were not experts—they taught their students far more than the students would have gotten ffthey had been in a major lecture course,” Kitcher said. “I actually think that the section leaders in any Core course are empowered if they don’t have to follow on the heels of an expert.” Faculty have also raised concerns that have not yet been ad'dressed'—most notably how Columbia College will staff the course. ' . Christie-Blick said that the preparatory effort to teach two semi-A nars each week, as outlined in the RGU proposal, will prove to be too burdensome on faculty. “The regular [Frontiers] faculty, who have all sorts of other responsibilities, teach just one seminar,” . he said. “They put a lot of effort into it, have enormous amounts of prep time to teach just that one seminar... Now you’re teaching two ‘ seminarsa week. How exactly does * that work?”Applegate also noted that the_ problem of stafﬁng needs to be better addressed, but that responsibility for resolving this lies. with the dean. . “The skeptics [of the proposal] came in and said ‘Who is going to teach this?” and that is going to be a problem,” he said. “That is not my problem. That is James Valentini’s problem because if you want to make this happen you’re going to need resources.” But Valentini said that no decision has yet been made—and will not be in the near future-about how the new course will be staffed. ,“There is no assumption about how the course will be staffed—who the instructors will-be, or how that will be developed,” he said. HAS RGU DESTABILIZED FRONTIERS? The reception of announcements about this new course, combined with a pervasive culture of criticism which has dogged Frontiers throughout its existence, have caused some to worry that the ~ development of RGU has “destabilized” the existing course and de- . moralized its students and faculty. _ Valentini announced in a blog post in 2013 that he had appointed a committee of students and faculty to develop a new science course for the Core and in fall 2014, he emailed a progress report to students detailing two preliminary visions for a new course. According to senior science . faculty, Valentini’s statements—-as ’ well as the leak of the EPPC report—fed into already negative attitudes surrounding the course. “Students haven’t warmed to it,” Marina Cords, Chair of the Committee on Science Instruction, said of Frontiers. “Sometimes I worry that the lore’ of the course follows it around like a bad reputation.” Christie-Blick said that Valentini’s remarks negatively impacted students’.perceptions of the course during a time when course evaluations had been steadily improving over time, a trend noted in the EPPC review. ’ V’ T “The message you got from Valentini and [CSC committee chairs] Kitcher and Demenocal -was that, ‘We’ve got this fantastic new course, and the reason we’re doing this by the way, is Frontiers is shitty,”’ Christie-Blick said. “And let‘ me tell you, the evaluations tanked.” . “ \ ~ Olsen, a professor who teaches ' Frontiers, agreed that Valentini’s announcements negatively impacted students’ perceptions of the class. ‘-‘Our reviews were improving pretty continuously since the beginning, it seemed remarkable that the one time something like that comes out, they immediately go down,” Olsen said. Faculty outside theleadership of the existing course share theconcern that the creation of RGU _ could negatively impact Frontiers. ' “I do feel sensitive to the possibility that this other course could somehow cause Frontiers to im_plode,” Cords said. N ‘ “Ithink itis terribly importantwe worked Very very hard to make our respect for-whatthe people in Frontiers of Science had done very very clear,” Kitcher said. “And yet, at various stages, I think that people in.Frontiers of Science felt that our committee work was undermining their activity.” Christie-Blick, who served as one of the chairs of Frontiers, resigned in 2014—a departure that was seen as a signiﬁcant blow to the course known for its committed faculty. Christie-Blick said that he resigned because the work being done to, create RGU “destabilized” Frontiers. . “This whole thing was so disas- . trous, I simply wasn’t willing to [be Chair],” Christie-Blick said. “I was totally committed to Frontiers and I’m no longer teaching it.”‘ ~ Christie-Blick also noted that he felt Valentini opposed the course and wanted to eliminate it. . “I don’t trust Valentini at all,” Christie-Blick said. “It’s a shame.” His frustration was noted by faculty members, many of whom expressed sympathy for his . position. « l V “In a certain sense, he was leading the course at a time when it was in limbo,”lKitcher said. “He was . very committed... and it was very frustrating for him.” i l‘ » ' But when asked about ChristieBlick’s role in leading Frontiers and the signiﬁcance of his departure, Valentini told Spectator that “it takes more than one faculty to propel a course.’?' He also denied that the development of RGU has destabilized Frontiers. , - V “We have never said that Frontiers is dead,” Valentini said. “We have always been careful to say the EPPC recommended we_ consider an alternative and we would pursue the consideration of alternative in parallel withthe offering of Frontiers of Science.” ‘ Despite What Kelley calls “on—going drama” that has been discouraging to some faculty mem- . -bers, she stressed that the course ' continues to evolve as it experiments with newteaching techniques to better engage students. This semester, for instance, Kelley and Ivana Hughes, the associate director of Frontiers, successfully applied for funding to implement an adaptive learning platform in the course’s neurosci- ’ ence module, which Kelley reports was highly successful. Hughes ‘declined to be interviewed by Spectator. g Loss IN MOMENTUM . While concerns surrounding . Frontiers’ evolution persist,"" many faculty are equally uncertain about the pace of RGU’s development. The original EPPC report said that the new science Core course could be launched as early as fall 2015.‘ But the revised report sent. out on Wednesday pushed back the timeline, noting that_ the course wouldn’t roll out until the 2017-18 year “at the earliest.” . According to Applegate, the g delay in the launch was caused by the loss of “momentum” in the a progress that the EPPC report had inspired. . ’ “There was a major year-long movement on it,” Applegate said. “What I thought should happen was that the report should have been item number one on the agenda. Jim Valentini decided he Was going to do something else.” While he acknowledged the concerns surrounding the delay in the launch, Kitcher felt that a longer deliberative process was % necessary to ensure the-success of the new course. V _ “We could’ve produced a course in a year——it probably wouldn’t have been very good,”Kitcher said. “You can’t do something this big quickly. You’ve got to get it right and it’s very hard.” As Valentini has sought widespread faculty participation inthis process, he has passed responsi- . bility for the progress of the new ‘ course between three separate fafculty committees. ‘. But momentum slowed when Valentini put responsibility for de-‘ veloping the course in the hands of a committee that only met six times a year—though he added that work should be conducted outside 5 of committee meetings as well. ¥ ’ ' ‘:‘Committees can take respon; . sibility for things, it doesn’t mean the actual work they take responsibility for is conducted solely during those meetings,” Valentini said. “ThatWon’t.be...th<= : Before the lonfge process to design, pilot, and roll out a new course even begins, this committee, the Committee on Science Instruction, will take the rest of the academic year to decide if the _ effort should even be pursued, according to Cords, the chair of the committee. ‘ I Even if COSI decides that tlie , new course should proceed, itis not yet clear who would be responsible for its design and implemen- ' tation, Cords said. ~ _ “There are lots of decisions [to be made],” Cords said. “Not only:if to go forward, but if we go forwaitd then how? Not only how would i the course get developed, but if;-it were developed, and there trial run, what might that involve?” Wednesday’s revised report i claimed that a pilot course would be ready by fall 2016, at the earliest. But, on Tuesday, Valentini was unwilling to give a new timeline for when testing for the new course might begin. , ~ “ “Right now, that’s difficult to say,” he said. - ""I.

642,Why the Core matters,19 November 2015,"§ ' BY ROBERT JOHN BOYLE l I walked back from last Thu_rsday’s rally feeling impasI sioned. As black Columbia students we held the rally to express our solidarity with those at the University of Missouri and Yale University, and all those around the world involved in the struggle against institutional racism. Many students gave speeches detailing their personal struggles with racism, the ways in which Columbia operates as an institution‘ of racism, and what these rallies mean in the larger context of black ' struggle. All of the speakers prepared Well, showed bravery in l sharing their stories, and brought up important topics, that I hope we will continue to discuss. I appreciate all those who i spoke; moments like Thursday’s rally make me proud to be both black and a Columbian. . O‘ , 1 While the majority of the rally was empowering, I took is- , It sue with a key idea. On at least three separate occasions during l the rally, I heard speakers referring to Literature Humanities I or Contemporary Civilization, or simply pointing at the names , engraved on the top of Butler Library, with contempt and ha- i I tred. They said things like, “Those people don’t speak for us,” or, “They didn’t write with us in mind.” The notion underly— . ing these statements is that students of coloreither cannot learn from, or should not be forced to learn from, writers who do not share’ their experiences. These claims are untrue and misrepresent the real purpose of Lit I-'lum, CC, and the Core Curriculum. A A . When astudent of color says that Homer did not write for her, she is correct. But at the same time,'she insinuates that Homer Wrote forsomeone else in particular: white people. And she is therefore arguing that the canon of “dead white males” is written for living white males. , B ' I ’ One can be deﬁned by their racial or ethnic -identity and still ﬁnd solace in a text that transcends identity. This is the notion I wish to do away with. Homer did not write for white American college students. We continue to read Homer, and-‘the classics generally, because they speak to our common humanity throughout time (please withhold your disgust at my use of so cliché a statement, at least until I am. ﬁnished trying to convince you). A When Homer _wrote about Achilles accepting the inevitability of his-own death, he was referring to the mortality with which we must all come to terms as human beings. When Euripides writes about the uncontrollable rage Medea felt after being dishonored by her former husband Jason, he reveals aspects of human nature withwhich we are all‘uncomfortI able. When Plato seeks to deﬁne justice, and when Aristotle i explores the concept of happiness, they do so with neither students of color nor our white classmates in mind. They had i their own audiences in mind, and who those people were does ! not matter——they dieda long time ago. V i 5 In short, we read the classics because they are classic. We 1 read them because they prove to be larger than the people who K wrote them and the people for which those authors wrote I them. , As with other works in the Gore, the Iliad is more than a poem written by a dead white man because it exempliﬁes ‘ universal elements of the human experience—themes bigger than race and ethnicity. Despite everything that divides us, the classics are meant to humanize us—to bring us all together. This is why the classics last. This is why they are timeless. Another idea advanced at the rally was that students of color have no opportunity to learn about themselves within the Core. For this reason, students have fought over the past several years to get authors of color into the curriculum. The addition of Toni | ,Morrison’s Song of Solomon is an example of their success thus far. This is good. Song of Solomon is undoubtedly a classic, and i it is something that everyone should read at some point. However, I caution students of color not to limit themselves in the scope of their learning. There is more to life than the black experience, and being black does not prohibit one from experiencing it. One can be deﬁned by their racial or ethnic identity and still ﬁnd solace in a text that transcends identity. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a personal favorite, certainly did not write with me in mind. But I can learn so much about how to live happily, healthily, and freely by interacting with his work. ' I those who spoke last Thursday not to do themselves a great disservice by looking upon Butler Library with contempt. The names up there are valuable. They represent a repository of human knowledge. As time goes on we must, of course, chip t in new names, but we must never remove those ﬁrst heroes. The author is .a Columbia College ﬁrst-year majoring in philosophy. ‘ , ."
